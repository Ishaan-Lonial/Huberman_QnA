vid00001," Welcome to the Human Relap podcast, where we discuss science, science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and up the Mall G at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are discussing ways to improve your fitness. In particular, we are going to discuss tools that you can incorporate into your existing fitness routine that will allow you to make significant improvement without having to invest a lot of extra time. Most of the tools we are going to discuss today were glean from the six episodes that we did with Dr. Andy Galpin. We provide a link to those full episodes in the show note captions, of course. Now those episodes included a very large number of protocols. Everything from how to build a fitness routine, how to enhance recovery, nutrition and supplementation, exercises and routines aim specifically at strength or hypertrophy or endurance or building anorobic capacity. What I've done is to select key protocols from those episodes that I myself have started to incorporate into my existing fitness routine, and that I think will be especially beneficial and frankly fun for you to incorporate into your fitness routine. Now a little bit later in this episode I review the key components of any fitness program. That is the number in type of cardiovascular training sessions and resistance training sessions that are essential for everyone to include as a template or a foundation for their overall fitness program. Now a little bit later in the episode I will be sure to review what are the essential components of any fitness program. So the number in type of resistance training sessions, the number in type of cardiovascular training sessions, as well as some of the elements of how those are arranged to ensure proper and adequate recovery between sessions so that you can continue to make ongoing progress. However the bulk of today's discussion is going to focus on tools that you can use again very easily, very quickly. In some cases even saving you time during your fitness regimen, in order to improve all aspects of your fitness, your endurance, your muscular endurance, your anaerobic capacity, your recovery, your strength, your hypertrophy. And in describing these tools to improve your fitness, it also provides an opportunity for each and all of us to step back from our existing fitness routine. And I ask whether or not it's really checking off all the boxes that are necessary, as well as where we can be more economical with our time in our efforts in order to reach our specific goals related to exercise and performance. So by the end of today's episode you can be sure that you have at least one and as many as 12 tools that you can incorporate into your existing fitness routine, again without adding much additional time or effort that are sure to accelerate your progress. I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costs to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrical like drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium and potassium, the electrolytes, but no sugar. Having adequate electrolytes is absolutely critical to cellular function. In particular, the function of neurons. Nor for your neurons to function properly. You need electrolytes in your system and you need to be well hydrated. There's a lot of research to support the fact that if you are even mildly dehydrated, that your cognition suffers, your physical performance suffers, and your sleep can also suffer. So getting adequate electrolytes in hydration is key and element allows you to do that. I typically mix element into 16 to 32 ounces of water and drink that first thing in the morning. I'll also drink another one during exercise. And sometimes another one after exercise as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot or it's a particularly hot day. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drink element.com slash uberman. And that spelled lmnt.com slash uberman. And you can claim a free sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drink element lmnt.com slash uberman to claim a free sample pack. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality. Many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. And I say that because when we are not sleeping well or enough, all of those things suffer. Conversely, when we are sleeping well and we're sleeping enough, all of those things improve. One of the key elements to getting a great night's sleep is to have the proper mattress. Helix mattresses are different because they are customized to your unique sleep needs. So if you go to their website and take a brief two minute quiz, they will match you to a mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs. The quiz asks questions such as do you sleep on your back or side of your stomach? Perhaps you don't know that's fine too. Or do you tend to run hot or cold during the night? Things of that sort that allow them to match you to a mattress that will give you the best possible night's sleep. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress a few years ago and it is vastly improved my sleep. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress, you can go to Helixleep.com-huberman to take that two minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress. You can also get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows. Again, if you're interested, you can go to Helixleep.com-huberman for up to $350 off and two free pillows. Let's talk about tools to improve your fitness. Before we do that, however, I just want to briefly remind everybody what constitutes a core or a foundational fitness program. Now, what I'm about to describe is not for the athlete that's trying to just improve one aspect of fitness or sports performance. So for instance, if you are a power lifter and your main goal is to move more weight on the core power lifting movements, or if you are somebody training for a marathon, it's likely that your core fitness program will differ substantially from what I'm about to describe. However, the vast majority of you are almost certainly trying to have some level of cardiovascular fitness. So the ability, perhaps to run a mile or more, certainly to be able to walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded. You almost certainly want some degree of strength. The ability to, perhaps, pick up a heavy load of groceries and carry it in one arm as you carry something else in the other arm. You want the ability to help move furniture. You want the ability certainly to not injure yourself when performing daily tasks. And perhaps you also want to be able to go out and play a pickup game of basketball or soccer or to go out on a long hike with a family without feeling so sore that you have to rest in bed the next day. An optimal fitness program of the sort that was covered in the optimal fitness protocols episode that I did is therefore one that checks off the major boxes that science tells us are important for health span and for lifespan. And also help us improve various aspects of performance and improve various aspects of aesthetics, whether it's fat loss or muscle growth if we choose. So without going into that program in a lot of detail, the core elements of it are that it include at least 150 minutes and ideally more like 200 minutes per week of so called zone two cardio. I'll talk a little bit more about zone two cardio a little bit later in the episode, but zone two cardio is for those of you that don't know. So a cardio vascular exercise that you can do while maintaining a conversation without getting winded, but that if you were to push a little bit harder that you would find it hard to complete your sentences. In general zone two cardio is the sort that you can do while purely nasal breathing unless you need to talk of course, it's perfectly fine to talk while doing zone two cardio. And again, the scientific research tells us that we should all be getting at least 150 minutes and probably more like 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week. Now in addition to that, a foundational or optimal fitness program for most people is going to include anywhere from two to four cardio vascular training sessions that are separate. That's right separate from the zone two cardio. As well as two to four resistance or strength training, sometimes also aimed at hypertrophy or muscle growth training sessions. Now we have to acknowledge that most people are probably not going to hit the upper threshold of all of those three things. Most people simply do not have the time and or discipline to get 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week plus four resistance training sessions plus four cardio vascular training sessions that are separate from the zone two cardio. As a consequence, the optimal fitness program that I described in that episode. And by the way, it's the program that I've essentially followed for the last 30 years or more includes three cardio vascular training sessions. So one longer duration sort of typical endurance type training. This would be a long slow jog or a long hike one day per week. As well as a shorter cardio vascular training session of about 25 to 30 minutes moving a bit faster getting the heart rate up a bit more breathing a little bit harder. As well as one very short cardio vascular training session that would fall under the category of high intensity interval training things like sprints which don't necessarily have to be done running to be done on a row or to be done on a bike. That's a row. So three cardio vascular training sessions as well as three resistance training sessions. I want to acknowledge that resistance training can be done with body weight, can be done with weights with machines. I talked about the differing virtues of one approach versus another, but nonetheless three resistance training sessions. One focusing specifically on leg training. One focus specifically on torso training. That's right. Chest shoulders and back altogether as well as some neck training for important reasons that were mentioned in that episode. And then a third session that was aimed at somewhat smaller body parts, biceps, triceps, calves and some other small body parts that tend to be neglected. And that are important to train if one wants to encourage muscular balance both aesthetically and structurally to avoid injury and have excellent posture. So those were the core elements of that foundational fitness program. And I mentioned then and I'll mention again now that that program is not a mandate. It is not an absolute requirement for anyone to follow. It was simply meant as a template from which people could evaluate their own existing fitness program, perhaps modify it somewhat or a lot. Or if you were interested in trying that specific fitness program that you could do that and we have provided a link both to that episode in the show note captions. But we've also provided a link to a table or chart that describes that foundational fitness program. It provides examples of different cardiovascular training and resistance type training sessions. And it describes some potential exercises in the rationale for those exercises and the rationale for selecting particular repetition ranges and rest between sets. All that information is available completely zero cost. You don't even need to sign up for anything. You simply go to the link that we provided in the show note captions. And there's a downloadable PDF there for you to explore. Now in addition to the solo episode that I did about optimal fitness protocols. We did a six episode guest series with Dr. Andy Galpin who is a professor of physiology at Cal State Fullerton in a world expert in all aspects of exercise and muscle physiology. That episode described a lot of the science and in particular science back tools for improving everything from long distance endurance to anaerobic capacity, strength, hypertrophy, speed, power recovery, nutrition, supplementation, and ways to develop a year-long program that will ensure you ongoing progress. In that series, Dr. Andy Galpin provided any enormous amount of valuable information such that anyone and everyone, meaning the person who's just interested in starting a fitness program or improving their existing fitness program. And to the elite athlete who's interested in improving their sprint times or their jump height or their power lifting or their marathon time could clearly benefit from somewhere all of the protocols that he described. Now because that series is so extensive in terms of its depth and breadth, again providing so much value at zero cost, thanks to Dr. Andy Galpin's expertise. But at the same time because it might be a little bit intimidating for many people out there to try and figure out which protocols to incorporate into their existing fitness regimen. I thought it would be fun and very beneficial to talk about some of the key tools that were described throughout that series that one could consider incorporating into their existing fitness routine now. So that's what this episode is really about. It's about the tools that I personally glean from those discussions and that I found to be of tremendous value in improving both my cardiovascular fitness, my strength and high-perchrophy training, my recovery, and other aspects of my overall fitness protocols. And that's beneficial, I mean, in terms of improving my cardiovascular fitness, improving my strength and high-perchrophy training, and that have improved the various metrics of fitness, life span and health span, which include things like heart rate variability, resting heart rate, blood pressure, the O2 max, as well as some of the fitness metrics that were described during that episode series with Dr. Andy Galpin, such as performance metrics, the ability to jump a certain distance, the ability to run a certain speed or to run a certain distance at a given speed. The ability to move weights in good form for certain number of repetitions. Again, all of the metrics of performance and health are going to vary tremendously from person to person, depending on where you're starting, how long you've been training, and other aspects of your health. The tools described in today's episode are designed for everybody. Again, these are simple tools that you can put into your existing routine that should really move the needle forward in terms of improving your overall levels of fitness and health. Let's talk about the tools to improve your fitness. The first tool is to mesh your zone to cardio with your daily activities. So, for those of you that don't know, zone to cardio is the type of movement that we typically call cardio exercise, that elevates your heart rate somewhat, increases your breathing somewhat, but that still allows you to carry out a conversation without having to pause or to gasp in order to complete your sentences. So, that's a general rule of thumb for zone to cardio. Now, for those of you that use a fitness tracker, you can monitor whether or not you are in zone to cardio very precisely, but if you're like me and you don't use a fitness tracker, it's very easy to know if you're in zone to cardio, because again, it's that level of output that puts you right below or somewhat below the threshold where if you were to exert yourself with any more intensity that you wouldn't be able to complete your sentences. Now, this could of course be evaluated by jogging with someone or walking with someone or hiking with someone and carrying out a conversation. If somebody isn't available, you could of course do this by trying to speak out loud and have a conversation with yourself, or if you want another way to monitor whether or not you're in zone to cardio without having to use a fitness tracker, you could simply ask yourself whether or not you are maintaining a level of output that increases your heart rate in your breathing, but that allows you to maintain purely nasal breathing. Any of those approaches will tell you more or less whether or not you're in zone to cardio. Now, the scientific data tell us that we should all be getting anywhere from 150 minutes to 200 minutes per week minimum of zone to cardio for sake of cardiovascular health, cerebral and a number of other aspects of health that are important essentially to everybody for health span and life span. Now, many people including myself, schedule zone to cardio into their weekly fitness regimen. So, for me, I have one day a week, for me it falls on a Sunday, where I go out for a jog that lasts anywhere from 60 minutes to 90 minutes. It's a slow jog. I can maintain nasal breathing the entire time or have a conversation with somebody else or myself the entire time if I like. Or sometimes it consists of a hike by myself or with other people and sometimes those hikes extend anywhere from an hour to four hours depending on the circumstances, etc. I will mention that whenever possible I try and do that once a week zone to cardio session out of doors because I like being in nature and I like getting sunlight and I like getting fresh air. During the discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin, I explained how I get my zone to cardio and I acknowledge that once a week session doesn't always allow me to reach that 150 minute to 200 minute minimum threshold of zone to cardio per week. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. And his response to that was very reassuring. What he said was, look, if you want a schedule zone to cardio and head out for a long Sunday jog or hike, terrific. If you want to schedule zone to cardio as two or more sessions on the treadmill or on the bike, great. But that he doesn't actually think of zone to cardio as exercise at all and to that I gasped and then I was a little bit deflated. I thought, oh, great. I'm doing all this zone to cardio and you don't even consider that exercise. And then when he said it was very reassuring and I think it's going to be very reassuring to all of you. He said first of all zone to cardio is absolutely critical to our health for a number of reasons that I already mentioned. But in addition to that zone to cardio does not impede and in fact can enhance our other aspects of fitness. So for example, our strength training, our hypertrophy training or any type of speed work or other types of cardio, and the best way to get zone to cardio is okay if you want to schedule it as a session. But that to simply increase the amount of walking and in particular walking at a rapid pace that one does, and to increase the total amount of movement that one's getting throughout the week. So taking groceries in and out of the grocery store. Taking around with the kids, taking a walk with a coworker while having a work discussion, taking your calls for work while pacing in the office or going outside. What he impressed on me is that zone to cardio can be meshed throughout the daily activities that I and everybody else generally have to do. And this was of great relief to me because I as many of you are am extremely busy. I don't have time to schedule in more cardio per week, or at least I don't see the way I could do that without reducing the amount of sleep that I'm getting. Or without reducing the amount of social connection that I'm getting with family and friends, both of which are extremely important to our mental health and physical health. So the basic tool here is yes, get 200 minutes per week minimum of zone to cardio. And notice I said 200 minutes, not 115 minutes to 200 minutes. I'm going to set the higher threshold of 200 minutes per week minimum of zone to cardio, but that you don't need to schedule that as time on the treadmill. If you want to, great. But what was communicated to me from Dr. Andy Galpin is that zone to cardio is immensely beneficial. It's not going to impede and in fact it's going to improve other aspects of fitness and that it does not have to impede and it in fact can improve other aspects of our daily life. Like our ability to engage socially, our ability to have a great output at work and whatever type of work you do. So the message is very simple. Get 200 minutes or more of zone to cardio per week and the message is also a very reassuring one, which is that that zone to cardio can be spread throughout your daily activities and that if you're doing enough of it, you probably don't even have to count the total amount of zone to cardio that you're getting. If you simply make the effort to move around a lot more during your daily activities and to mesh that zone to cardio with your daily activities, you're going to hit that threshold of 200 minutes per week minimum. Now that's a great message for me because I'm already doing the three resistance training workouts per week. I'm doing what now I can just call the two other cardiovascular training workouts per week because now I don't even count that long Sunday jogger Sunday hike as exercise. I just consider that movement out of doors on the weekend. And in doing so, it's also allowed me to really enjoy that a lot more. There's something about considering something a fitness training program that shifts it from just recreation and enjoying life to training. And I of course love training. I love training in the gym and I love training out of doors. I love running. I love lifting weights. I love all sorts of physical training. I know many people do. I know many people don't. But if one looks at zone to cardio as just part of their daily life, you're far more likely to get that zone to cardio in and all the benefits that come with it. And you're also opening up time for work for social engagements and to do and pay attention to other aspects of fitness, which is what we're going to talk about next. The second tool that I've incorporated into my fitness regimen, and that I believe can be of great benefit to frankly everybody, is to start including low repetition pure strength work. Now some of you may already be doing low repetition pure strength work, but I believe that most people don't. Most people who do resistance training are using either machines or free weights or some combination of those. Or perhaps are using body weight. And they tend to focus on repetition ranges from about five and usually more like six repetitions out to about 10 and perhaps 15 repetitions. Now of course doing resistance training in repetition ranges of five to 15 reps per set provided it's done at sufficient intensity. So either two failure or close to failure of course in good form is tremendously beneficial. It can help build strength. It can enhance eye purgher fee. There is tremendous value to training in those repetition ranges. But when I sat down with Dr. Andy Gallpin to discuss resistance training specifically, he made it very clear that at least for some portion of ones yearly training cycle. So perhaps eight weeks or ten weeks or in the case that I adopted 12 weeks. There is tremendous benefit to training in the three to five repetition range and maybe even lower. So the second tool of training specifically for strength in this three to five repetition range is something that I started to incorporate after I sat down to record that series. And I'll just tell you a few of the benefits that I've experienced and then I'll tell you the specific protocol that makes it very easy to do this. The most obvious benefit to me was that I got much stronger. And that strength persisted such that when I went back to using higher repetition ranges. So typically I trained with weights or machines in the six to ten repetition range. Sometimes a little higher, sometimes a little lower. But never before had I specifically trained in the three to five repetition range exclusively for a period of ten to twelve weeks. And when I did that I of course gained strength. But that strength stayed with me such that when I returned to higher repetition ranges I could use more weight in good form. And that of course enhanced strength and hypertrophy further. In addition there was another effect that was at least to me very unexpected which was that my cardiovascular training improves significantly. Now why would this be because typically a three to five repetition set does not elevate the heart rate for long enough that you would consider cardiovascular training. And of course the rest period between those sets is pretty long as well. So even if heart rate goes up during those heavy sets. And then I'm going to go down during those long three to five minute rest periods between those sets. But what I noticed was that my overall posture and my ability to maintain cardiovascular output while using good running form or good rowing form was also vastly improved. And the logical interpretation of why that would be is simply that the muscles got stronger. And those same muscles are being incorporated into the cardiovascular. And during this work that I'm doing on other days. And therefore I can carry out those cardiovascular training sessions in better form for longer periods of time. I actually felt much stronger during my cardiovascular training as I got much stronger moving these heavier weight loads for low repetition sets. And then the third specific benefit that I noticed is that when training heavy for three to five repetitions per set. I didn't get sore. And this to me was an incredible benefit because typically when I train in the six repetition to 15 repetition range. And I take those sets to failure or near failure. I do experience some soreness the next day. Ordinarily that soreness isn't so intense that it prevents me from doing any of the other sorts of workouts that I do. And for those of you that have visited that foundational fitness protocol, you know that I hit each major and minor muscle group once per week directly as well as once per week indirectly. That's the overall structure of that program. In order to allow sufficient recovery between those resistance training workouts to be able to make continual progress. Now by training in this three to five repetition range that Dr. Andy Galvin suggested, I was able to improve my strength improve my cardiovascular output reduced soreness. I also just felt better overall. I had a lot more energy after those workouts than I typically do after my resistance training sessions. When I use higher repetition ranges, we're just a number of different things that made me feel wow. This is really a powerful protocol. And of course moving heavier weights in the gym feels good too. It feels good to get stronger at least there's a positive feedback there for me. And I think for most people. And I should also mention that for those of you that are averse to doing heavier resistance training in this three to five repetition range. Because you fear that it will make you too big or too bulky. Training in the low repetition ranges is actually more geared towards increasing strength and is shifting away somewhat from increasing hypertrophy or muscle size. So that's a great benefit for those of you that want to be strong and also want to maintain cardiovascular fitness. But you don't want to add muscular size. And of course, for all of you that want to add muscular size. It's well established that increasing your strength will allow you then to return to patterns of hypertrophy training that will allow you to use heavier weights and therefore induce greater hypertrophy. So there are so many reasons to incorporate these strength training protocols. So the way that Dr. Andy Galvin suggested one do it and was the way that I did it is uses three by five protocol. The three by five protocol is very straightforward. It involves doing three to five exercises per workout. Okay, so if it's a workout for legs, three to five exercises. If it's a workout for some upper body muscle, three to five exercises. Three to five exercises for three to five sets per exercise. Three to five repetitions per set and three to five minutes of rest between each set. In addition, he emphasized that one can do those workouts three to five times per week. Although I'm going to put in a few extra next to that last statement because I found that I couldn't do the three by five protocol say for legs specifically three to five times per week. I realize that might be possible for some people, but I'm somebody who like many of you out there, either doesn't have the time or doesn't have the recovery capacity to train my legs three to five times per week. Even though I acknowledge that there are probably ways to do that would still allow me to recover. It just simply starts to impede into other areas of training. It starts to impede other areas of life like work and family and sleep and all the rest. So what I did and what I'm suggesting to you, you try is for any existing resistance training that you're doing to take a period of eight or ten or ideally twelve weeks and do the vast majority. If not all of that resistance training in the lower repetition range that's designed specifically to induce strength adaptations. And to not pay attention to whether or not you're hitting that same muscle group three to five times per week. Rather if you train your legs once or twice per week to simply do all of the work for your legs in that three to five repetition range. If you train an upper body muscle or muscle groups, chest shoulders back once per week or twice per week to just stay within that three to five repetition range for those work sets, right? Warmups can include a few more reps. And then to adhere to this three to five exercises three to five sets per exercise three to five repetitions per set and three to five minutes between sets. Now the one exception to this that I incorporated was that for very small muscle groups so for instance the rear deltoids or for neck work or for calf work to not rely purely on three to five repetitions. But maybe to work in a range of anywhere from five to eight repetitions. So still fairly low repetitions, but not so low that it restricts you to three to five repetitions. The reason for that is that I and I think a lot of people out there find it hard to fatigue those smaller muscle groups adequately with good form when restricting oneself to those low repetitions. However for big compound movements like presses and squats and dead lifts and glute ham raises and things of that sort maybe even leg extensions and leg curls which are isolation exercises of course. To really restrict oneself to those three to five repetition ranges that take you to failure or near failure. I listed off the benefits of doing that that I experienced and I'm confident that you will also experience a lot of benefits. So just to remind you what some of those benefits are you get stronger which feels great that occurs within your weight workouts, but it also carries over to your endurance training sessions. I also noticed that when we're returning to higher repetitions for resistance training so after 12 weeks shifting away from three to five repetition ranges and going back to training in the six to ten repetition ranges mainly occasionally up to 12 or 15 but really mainly restricting to six to ten repetitions. That you can move much heavier weights in good form and thereby induce more hypertrophy while still also continuing to gain some strength. And another benefit was again reduce soreness compared to when training with higher repetition ranges and more mental freshness. It's I guess the only way to describe it when training in those lower repetition ranges. I don't know about you but when I finish a really hard hour long resistance training session done in the six to 12 repetition range. There's a certain type of mental fatigue that even if I eat properly afterwards even if I hydrate properly that it tends to sap a bit of my mental energy later in the day. But that training at the three to five repetition range did just the opposite it actually enhanced my focus and my cognition my overall levels of physical energy. Which is great because it allows you to do all the other things that were required to do throughout the day and by the way it would also allow you to get more of that zone two cardio. So if you want more details on the three by five protocol again that's time stamped in the relevant episode on strength and hypertrophy that we did with Dr. Andy Galpin. I'll also provide a link to that specific time stamp in the show note caption to this episode. I do want to point out that you don't just jump right into heavy sets of three to five repetitions you need to warm up adequately for some people that warm up will be higher repetition sets. So say 10 to 12 repetitions with just the empty bar or a lightweight and then adding a little bit of weight and doing eight repetitions and maybe six repetitions and then your work sets as they're called of three to five repetitions or. Perhaps you're like me and you prefer to do low repetition warm up so this was also something that I discussed with Dr. Andy Galpin and that for me has made a tremendous positive impact on all my resistance training regardless of whether or not it is low repetition or higher repetition. And that's to do a brief warm up set that is somewhere in the range of six to eight repetitions very light just to get familiar with the movement. Then to do a second warm up set that includes some load on the bar or the freeway to the machine and then a second warm up set. Again this could be free weights or machines that incorporates a bit more load but still keeps the repetitions low so in the four to six repetition range and then maybe especially if it's at the beginning of the workout and my core body temperature is intelligated yet. I'll do a third warm up but that third warm up which of course is going to be progressively a little bit heavier than the first or second warm up is still going to fall within the low repetition range so just two to four repetitions. For me including a few more warm upsets with progressively heavier weight on each warm up but still keeping the total repetition count low so somewhere in the range of two to six repetitions. Has been very beneficial for improving my workout put during the so-called work sets regardless of whether or not I'm training in the three to five repetition range or whether or not I'm training in the six to fifteen repetition range. I know for some people this might be kind of surprising how is it that my work sets are actually higher repetition than my warm upsets or put differently. How and why is it that my warm upsets are lower repetition than my work sets and that's because I fall into this category of people that tends to fatigue pretty quickly when doing resistance training. So for me keeping the repetition count on any individual warm up set pretty low has allowed me to really improve my strength output and really improve my strength and high-purchar free training when I shift to the so-called work sets. I already listed off a number of important documented benefits and benefits that I've certainly experienced by incorporating low repetition pure strength work into my yearly training cycle for periods of eight to twelve weeks. In addition to that during my conversation with Dr. Andy Gallpin he said something very important for everyone to hear and understand. He said when you look at the data on aging and performance in particular muscular performance. You see some very interesting patterns within the data. He said for instance that for every year after age 40 there's a 1% drop in muscle size that can be offset by resistance training but that if you don't do resistance training that you won't offset. During that series we also talked about the minimum requirement for six and probably more like ten working sets per muscle group per week in order to at least maintain muscle size. Not just age 40 and beyond but even at younger ages. So that's muscle size 1% decrease per year unless you do the right thing and the right thing is get six to ten working sets per week in order to offset that decrease. And if you train properly for hypertrophy yes you can still increase muscle size past age 40. In addition he said that there is a 3 to 5% reduction per year for every year past age 40 in strength and power. That's a very important metric because what it's telling us is that the drop off in strength and power is significantly greater per each year after age 40 than is the decrease in muscle size. Telling us that we have to do something to offset that decrease in strength and power. In addition he mentioned that for every year past age 40 there is an 8 to 10% decrease in speed and in explosiveness. And so if one is interested in maintaining speed of muscular movement and explosiveness of muscular movement something that's perhaps important to a number of you. One also has to incorporate training specifically geared toward maintaining or improving speed and explosiveness. Now I like many people and not so interested in speed and explosiveness I know they have their utility but I am interested in maintaining muscle size. Over the course of my life perhaps even adding some muscle to particular muscle groups. I'm also very interested in at least maintaining and ideally even gaining some strength in certain muscle groups throughout my entire lifespan. And that's not just for performance reasons that's also because we know that maintaining or improving strength of our muscles is very important across the entire lifespan. But especially in the years spanning from 40 until death which I think for most people fall somewhere between 50, 60, 70 or ideally out into the 80s and 90s or hundreds. Right. That's what we're all seeking is to die later in better health. And in order to do that we have to dedicate some very specific training protocols in order to maintain or build strength. So to summarize in addition to all the positive reasons to do dedicated strength training that I mentioned before. It's highly recommended that you do some dedicated strength training for the purposes of offsetting the age related to climb and strength that occurs again 3 to 5% per year past age 40 which is a pretty significant decline. But the good news is if you do the 3 to 5 protocol for say 12 weeks per year and then you continue to resistance train using other repetition ranges. Your towards high-perrophy end strength or perhaps even muscular endurance. The good news is you'll maintain your strength and perhaps even build your strength offsetting that natural decrease that would otherwise occur. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens now called AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health. Those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. It tastes great. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman. They'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road and the car on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3K2. The next tool I'm about to describe relates to your cardiovascular training and it's a tool that can greatly improve your cardiovascular fitness with a limited amount of time commitment. But that is not to say it is easy. What I'm referring to is the so-called sugar cane. If you listen to the series with Dr. Andy Galpin, you may recall our discussion about the sugar cane, which is so named after our friend and expert trainer Kenny Kane. And it is a very efficient yet somewhat brutal way to increase your cardiovascular output. So the sugar cane is the type of protocol that you would incorporate once in the period of a week, but certainly not every week. It's the kind of thing that you might throw in once every two weeks or once every four weeks as a replacement for your other high intensity interval training. The sugar cane involves selecting some form of exercise that you can do at high intensity safely. And of course, we'll differ between individuals. For some of you, it will be a stationary bike. For others of you, it will be a road bike. For others of you will be running and for others of you will be growing. The exact form of exercise is not important. What is important is that you can generate a lot of intensity. So you're going to be doing some sprint like work, although not all out sprints, except on the final round. The problem is that you're going to be doing some sprint like this, but you're going to be doing some sprint like this. But again, you need to select a movement that you can do without injuring yourself while still performing a movement at high intensity. So for me, that would be running for you. It might be something else. The sugar cane is pretty straightforward in structure. It involves three rounds after a brief warm up, of course. So you're going to do three to five minutes of jogging or jumping jacks or skipping rope. Something to get your core body temperature up so that you're prepared to do the high intensity work. And then there are only three rounds of high intensity work and they go as the following. In round one, you're going to take two minutes, so you'll need to set a timer for two minutes, and you're going to go the maximum distance that you can in that two minutes. So run the maximum distance that you can for two minutes or cycle the maximum distance that you can for two minutes or verse a climber of the maximum distance that you can for two minutes. Whatever you select, you're going to do that as far in as fast as you can for the duration of two minutes. So depending on the movement and depending on your level of fitness, that distance might be 400 meters, 600 meters, 800 meters, etc. Whatever distance you travel in that two minutes, you're going to mark that distance down in your mind or in your phone or on a piece of paper. And then you're going to rest two minutes. So two minutes of work, then rest two minutes. Then in round two, you're going to go the same distance that you did in round one. And you're going to take as much time as you need to do that distance as fast as you can. So if you went 600 meters in two minutes for round one in round two, you're going to go 600 meters. And it's going to take you however long it takes you. Chances are if you really did the best you could in round one, you were at maximum output for the first two minutes. That in round two, it's going to take you longer than two minutes to travel that equivalent distance. However, there is the possibility that it will take you less time. But for most people, it's going to take you more time. So staying with this example of 600 meters in two minutes on round one in round two, you're going to go 600 meters. Let's say it takes you two minutes and 30 seconds. You then are going to mark down how long round two took you. So in this case, the example is two minutes and 30 seconds. Then you're going to rest another two minutes. And then in round three, you're going to go all out again as fast and as safely as you can. So for the same duration that you did in round two, and your goal is to go at least as far as you went in round one. And if they're still time left, you're going to continue to go all out again as fast as you safely can until the entire duration is completed. So it's really just three rounds with two rest periods in between round one and round three. And then I highly recommend that after round three, that you do some sort of dedicated cool down. So instead of just flopping onto the bench or the floor or the lawn that you walk around slowly until you recover your breathing. The reason I like to sugarcane as a tool that one implements once every say two to four weeks as a replacement for one's typical high-intensity interval training is severalfold. First of all, if you provide the right intensity in round one and round two and round three, it is sure to elevate your heart rate substantially. And in doing so, improve your VO2 max, which is correlated with all sorts of important metrics related to health span, performance and lifespan. Second of all, it gamifies things a little bit. It pits you against yourself in the sense that if you go out at maximum speed, again, performing a movement that you can safely perform at maximum speed in round one. Well, then you have something to compete against in round two and round three. And that makes the high-intensity interval training, first of all, very intense. But also, it makes it kind of fun in a way that lets you forget just how painful the whole thing is. The next tool to improve your fitness is called exercise snacks. And as the name suggests, this is a fun one. And we're suggested by Dr. Andy Galpin as a way to either enhance or maintain your fitness, depending on how your core or foundational fitness program is going. So when I say core, I don't mean your abs. I mean, whether you're getting your regular cardio and your regular resistance training. If you were to add one or several of these exercise snacks per week, it can further improve things like VO2 max, muscular endurance, et cetera. And I'm going to talk about the specific snacks that you will be doing in a moment. However, as Dr. Andy Galpin also pointed out, there are times in which we happen to not be following our foundational fitness program, either because work demands or family demands or we're traveling. We're simply not keeping up with our basic routine. And under those conditions, exercise snacks are a terrific way to maintain the fitness that you've already built and developed. And you don't lose any ground in a week's say where you get particularly busy. Now exercise snacks can take on a variety of different forms, but for sake of simplicity and clarity, today we're going to divide them into two major categories. The first category are exercise snacks that are going to improve or maintain your cardiovascular fitness, your ability to run or cycle or row. So some distance say 12 minutes or longer, but keep in mind these exercise snacks are very, very brief. They don't require that you do them for 12 minutes or longer. What they are going to do is either maintain or enhance the type of endurance that allows you to continue in an activity for 12 minutes or longer. The second category of exercise snack relates to muscular endurance. The first category of exercise snack is a very important aspect of fitness. And even though some people are already training for muscular endurance, something that most people are not doing enough training for. Muscular endurance is your ability to maintain a wall set or to maintain a plank or to do the maximum number of push-ups that you can do in one session. The sort of drop to the floor and give me as many push-ups as you possibly can type of thing or as many sit-ups as you can type of thing. The endurance translates to a number of other aspects of fitness and it's something that we should all be working on. And again, many people just don't make space for it in their regular routine. So now we have these two categories of exercise snacks. One geared toward enhancing or maintaining your cardiovascular fitness as it translates to longer duration endurance activity. So 12 minutes are longer and then the other category is purely muscular endurance, which is essentially some bout of exercise that's going to be fairly brief. So let me give you an example of an exercise snack for enhancing your long duration endurance. 12 minutes are longer and this is the sort of thing that if you're going to incorporate into your routine and I highly recommend that you do, can essentially be done anytime with no warm-up. A good example of an exercise snack of this type would be to suddenly stand up from your desk and to do a hundred jumping jacks. Now depending on how fit you are and how fast you do those jumping jacks and how wide and you know tall you do those jumping jacks, meaning you know are you doing these kind of little things where your hands don't actually meet and you're having like partying your legs just a little bit. Or are you doing full jumping jacks or really jumping and you know setting your feet out as wide as you comfortably and safely can and then bringing your hands together. You could take you anywhere from 30 seconds to 90 seconds okay. So in the case of jumping jacks you may end up doing this for 90 seconds but the point is to simply do a hundred jumping jacks or if that takes too long you could even do just 25 or 50 jumping jacks. The point is that it's going to get you moving your muscles. It's going to get your heart rate up. Even if you're very very fit if you're doing these fast enough and you're doing them with proper form it's going to get your heart rate up and then you're done. You can sit back down to your desk or you can continue to walk through the airport. Yes, I've done these in the airport typically not walking toward my gate but at the gate but occasionally I'm feeling with our jake or I haven't had the opportunity to train that day. And perhaps I won't get the opportunity to train so I'll do something like a hundred jumping jacks while facing the window. So it feels a little less awkward facing people while you're doing them. And of course you don't have to do jumping jacks and equally effective type of exercise snack is to find a stairwell and to simply go up that stairwell as fast as you safely can for 20 to 30 seconds. So perhaps just find the bottom of a stairwell and go up that stairwell as quickly as you can and perhaps go down as quickly as you can and just keep doing that for a minute. And just keep doing that for about 20 to 40 seconds and then you're essentially done. Okay, you could also opt to pick some distance away from your car in the parking lot. You know assuming you're not carrying any heavy bags or anything and simply run to your car. So 20 to 30 seconds of not necessarily all out sprinting you don't want to injure yourself because again this is done without a warm up. These exercise snacks are designed to be inserted into your day and into your week. Essentially at random you could plan them if you want but anytime you feel inspired or perhaps anytime you're feeling like you don't want to do one you could simply do one of these exercise snacks. And of course doing jumping jacks or running to your car or taking the stairs very quickly up and down or just up and then walking down for instance and doing a few jumping jacks. Things of that sort of course can take on a near infinite number of different variations. So if you don't like any of the variations that I just presented you can easily come up with something else again the purpose of these exercise snacks is to get your heart rate up. It's of course to do this while not getting injured and it is entirely compatible with an existing exercise program. It in no way is going to impede your performance in strength or hypertrophy or other forms of long form endurance or high intensity interval training quite to the contrary. Everything we know about these exercise snacks is that they enhance various aspects of your physiology in ways that promote both recovery and performance in your other types of exercise and your other types of athletic endeavors. So no reason to think that they are going to be problematic for your training but of course don't trip don't fall. So you can undertake a movement that puts you into a range of motion that has you hurting your back your knee or any other part of your body. You know start off slowly and find something that really works for you. So these are very easy. They take very little time. They're fun to be honest. And as was discussed in the conversation with Dr. Andy Galpin, they're also very effective. The category of exercise snack are the exercise snacks that enhance muscular endurance. So muscular endurance is the type of endurance that allows you to maintain a fixed position for some period of time. Usually somewhere between one and three minutes, but these endurance bouts are never going to last 12 or more minutes unless you are exceptionally evolved in terms of your muscular endurance abilities. What I'm talking about here are things like planks, wall sits, maximum number of pushups, things of that sort. And this is an aspect of fitness that translates to other aspects of fitness in a very important way. And again, this was covered in the exercise series with Dr. Andy Galpin. I don't want to go into any of the details now because it was all covered there. It's very easy to look up because it's time stamped. But just in brief, muscular endurance allows the build up of more microvascular supply. To muscles and connective tissue in a way that allows delivery and removal of more nutrients and waste products. Now I realize to the physios things like nutrients and waste products as far too broad a category, but what we're talking about here is the ability to deliver more fuel and oxygen. And to remove waste products of muscular effort or to be more specific neuromuscular effort. This is a great thing because it can help you enhance your strength training, enhance your high-purchar-free training, enhance your long-distance endurance and your middle-distance and even your short-distance endurance. And these exercise snacks for building muscular endurance are exceedingly easy to do and you can even do them while talking on the phone, especially if you're using headphones or if you have your phone on speaker. A good example of an exercise snack for muscular endurance would be a 30-60 second or perhaps longer wall sit. So remember wall sits, wall sits are as the name suggests, where you put your feet out some distance from a wall you squat down into a seated position, but there's no chair there and then you maintain that seated position. And that is harder to do over time. You could lean back against the wall a little bit harder if you wanted to gain some extra support and continue, but the idea here is that you're going to go, not necessarily to muscular failure, but to the point where you can't continue to sit in that wall sit position. You could also simply do this as an air squat down to the bottom position, where you're comfortable, and then you don't want to rest down there. I mean you want to maintain some tension and your quadriceps and other muscles of your lower body, so that you're actively trying to support yourself in the seated position, but without a seat below you. That can be done again, wall on a speaker phone conversation, that can be done at random throughout the day. You can just decide, okay, I'm going to do a wall sit now and I'm going to time myself. I'm going to see how long I can do this for. Or you could decide to do a plank. I've done this wall on a phone call, sorry if it was you that I was talking to, but I put the phone on speaker and just got into a plank position. And then I'll just have the conversation in the plank position. I don't fight to maintain that plank position past the point where I could continue to have a conversation. So again, this is a type of exercise that one is trying to incorporate into their daily routine. If you wanted to dedicate a specific amount of time just to doing these exercise snacks you could, but it's far more reasonable to assume that people will incorporate these into their daily routine more regularly. If you can incorporate it truly into the other aspects of your routine like work. You do this wall watching TV or listening to a podcast. One form of muscular endurance exercise snack that's really terrific and is a bit of a challenge that's fun is to just simply see how many pushups you can do. And we talked about proper pushup form during the episode series with Dr. Andy Galpin, but here what we're talking about is chest all the way to the ground. So it touches the ground, then pushing up till your arms are completely straight. That's one pushup and then continuing in piston like fashion, meaning you're not pausing at the top and taking a bunch of breaths. You're not going to a plank position in other words, but continuing to do as many pushups as you can to see whether or not you can enhance that number over time. And in any case, just as simply get your body working to engage the muscles of your chest, your shoulders, your triceps, and your core, etc. And to do that, everyone's in a while. So instead of needing somebody to say drop and give me 20, just see whether or not some point any point throughout the day and get into a pushup position to your maximum number of pushups and just mentally note that number to yourself. Again, these exercise snacks serve multiple roles. They're designed to get you moving to get your heart rate going to maintain or enhance your fitness and other domains of fitness. And this is very important to not take too much time out of your schedule. In fact, like zone two cardio, right, being the type of movement that you're just going to do a lot throughout the week, caring groceries, etc. As we discussed earlier, these exercise snacks are designed to be incorporated into your daily life. And I must say that having started doing these after recording the series with Dr. Andy Galpin, I've noticed two things. First of all, including these exercise snacks, at least once a week and more like three to five times a week for me. So that's one exercise snack done three to five times per week. It has definitely correlated with improvements in my fitness and other domains of fitness, strength, hypertrophy, long distance endurance, etc. Now, I've changed a number of other things as well as a consequence of that series with Dr. Andy Galpin. So I can't say for sure that it's the exercise snacks per say that are causing all those positive shifts. I have to imagine that it's not just the exercise snacks, but they've become an important part of my routine. And that relates to the second point, which is that the exercise snacks are designed to be fun and easy. And so I really enjoy doing them so much so that if I don't do one for a couple of days, it starts to crave them a little bit kind of like the other kind of snack. The next category of tool to improve your fitness relates to breathing or respiration. Breathing and respiration is an enormous topic in and of itself. In fact, I did an entire episode on breathing and respiration. And this is a topic that my laboratory works on extensively as it relates to anxiety, control, and some other aspects of mental health as well as to physical performance. For today's discussion, I want to just review a few tools that one can incorporate both into workouts and around workouts that can greatly enhance fitness and recovery. The first one is the type of respiration tool that you use between sets of exercise. Again, here we're talking about resistance training, but we could just as easily be talking about rest between rounds of say high-intensity interval training. So for instance, between bouts of sprinting on the track or the bike or the treadmill or the roar. A great pattern of breathing to incorporate during respite between sets is something that I've talked about before in other contexts, which is the physiological side. The physiological side is a deep inhale through the nose to maximally or near maximally inflate your lungs. And then a second very brief inhale and it's necessarily brief because your lungs are already pretty full. To maximally inflate your lungs and to make sure that any of the little sacs, the little avioli of your lungs that have collapsed during the exercise exertion will re-inflate. And then a long exhale until long's empty. So I'll demonstrate it right now as I've done many times before, but if you haven't seen it or heard it before, it's two inhales followed by an extended exhale and it goes like this. You'll notice that the inhales were through the nose and the exhale was through the mouth. That's the ideal way to do it for a number of reasons. Check out the episode that I did on respiration physiology, aka breathing. If you want more details on why that is. But two inhales through the nose and a long extended exhale through the mouth, the so-called physiological side, not named by me, but rather named by physiologists in the 1930s, is as far as we know, the fastest way to shift your nervous system from so-called sympathetic drive to more parasympathetic drive from a state of greater alertness to a state of greater calm. Now the reason to do this between sets of resistance training is that the more that you can shift yourself from sympathetic drive to parasympathetic drive. That is from alert to calm in between sets. The more energy and focus you can devote to exertion during your work sets. So one way to do this, that's very convenient and very effective is to consider the last repetition of your set of physiological side, which is not to say, one of you very clear, which is not to say that you should do the physiological side during your set. That in fact I recommend you do not do that. But rather, if you're doing six repetitions of a given exercise and you, let's say, fail on the six, though are you do that six repetition and you're just close to failure, because again, your work set should be two failure or close to it, most of the time. Then set down the weight and then you're going to do the next repetition as the physiological side. Meaning you're not going to do the movement, you're going to think of doing a physiological side as the last repetition of every set, not during the last repetition of the resistance training movement. So the physiological side is something you do at the beginning of the rest period immediately following a set. If you'd rather think about it that way, because it's more convenient than thinking about as the last rep of a set, be my guest. Whatever works for you. But what you'll quickly find is that if you do a physiological side right after completing your last repetition, you'll calm down much more quickly. Your heart rate will come down more quickly. And you'll recover more completely in whatever designated rest period you've allowed yourself, whether or not it's 30 seconds, which would be very short, frankly, or it's a five minute period of rest between sets. If you do one truly just one physiological side at the beginning of the rest period, you are going to effectively shift your nervous system in the direction you want it to go during those rest periods. And of course, if you're training hard during your work sets, you run zero risk whatsoever of feeling so calm that you don't feel motivated to do your next set. I promise you that it will allow you to relax more at the beginning of the rest period than you ordinarily would, to shift into a state of rest. They're differing opinions about whether or not you should walk around or stay still during your rest periods. I like to walk around a bit and stay standing. I'm not one of these people that kind of collapses into a C shape on the bench in between sets. I like to stand up and you know, breathe normally walk around during the water, et cetera. In any case, doing a physiological side to beginning of each rest interval between worksets of resistance training is a very effective way to enhance your focus and your output during your work sets. Now, the last respiration tool to improve your fitness is again a tool, gleaned from the discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin, and that's to include a three to five minute period at the end of every single workout. So, doesn't matter if it's high-intensity interval training or its resistance training or it's a long run of some sort at the end of every workout to take three to five minutes. So, you'll want to set a timer and to do some form of parasympathetic that is calming, promoting breathing in order to shift your nervous system from a state of heightened alertness and output into a state of recovery because as you all well know by now, you get fitter not during your workouts, but rather after your workouts in between workouts. You stimulate the adaptation during a workout, but you get the adaptation, you get the actual improvement in between workouts. And a common mistake that many people make and I made this mistake for years was to finish a great workout and then you know, you're texting on your phone or you're talking on the phone or you're driving home. It's certainly not as intense as the workout that you just did. Maybe you're even feeling really calm from a nice long jog or you had a particularly good workout that day and you're feeling really happy. So you're enjoying the high, so to speak. Well, when you do three to five minutes of what's often called downregulation breathing. After a workout it allows you to recover and to induce the adaptation that you've been after, the one that you actually trained for much more quickly. I can't tell you how many people I know who start to incorporate this into their workouts. Find that they recover far better from their workouts, which might seem a little bit surprising. You know, why would it be that just three to five minutes of some activity would enhance recovery to such a great degree? And that's because typically people don't book end their workouts. They finish their workouts and of course they're not continuing to lift weights or run, but they move about their day in their life, even if it's preparing a meal in a way that the level of stress and therefore stress hormones, things like cortisol adrenaline, things that by the way are excellent to elevate during a workout. Things like inflammatory markers, which by the way are great to enhance during a workout. That actually happens during a workout. You have a massive increase in inflammatory markers, which might seem bad, but all of those things are enhancing the adaptation that you're seeking. But as soon as those workouts end, you want to shift into recovery mode. And this three to five minutes of downregulation breathing is a terrific way to do that. There are a couple different patterns of breathing that will work best, but all of them emphasize exhales. Okay. I want to repeat that. All of them emphasize exhales. So for instance, you could just choose slow deliberate breathing. How does that emphasize exhales? Well, ordinarily when we breathe, we inhale actively and we exhale passively. Whenever we deliberately breathe more slowly, we are actively exhaling. Okay. So active exhales really promote the calming response in brain and body. The other thing you could do, which many people are now doing, is to do a repeated round of physiological size. So the double inhale through the nose, long exhale through the mouth, but repeated for, say, three minutes. That's another version. The other thing you could do is simply to notice your exhales and to emphasize your exhales. Make them longer and more vigorous than your inhale. Now you don't want to turn this into a breath work session where you're, you know, you're doing, you know, Pruni, Amar, or Kumbilini breathing or something of that sort. The idea is to calm down. So anytime you're extending your exhales, you're actively exhaling, you're trying to slow your breathing down overall. You're going to shift yourself in the right direction. So rather than complicate this type of tool, the best thing you can do is just focus on those exhales. Slow your breathing overall. Use physiological size if you want, or simply sit in your vehicle, or if you have to drive home while doing this extended exhale type of down regulation. Ideally, you would take a couple of minutes and just shift your whole system by not driving, you know, closing your eyes and just sitting in your car, stationary, of course, don't drive with your eyes closed or bike with your eyes closed. Just simply calm down, extend your exhales and shift from the workout to the recovery mode, which is where the progress is going to arrive. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker. Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. Within side tracker, they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data that is to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean, and behavioral supplement nutrition and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health. Inside trackers ultimate plan now includes measures of both APOB and of insulin, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation.

The next tools to improve your fitness are psychological tools and they're really geared toward enhancing your focus during your workout and separating or segmenting your workouts from the other parts of your day. Now, of course, workouts are naturally segmented from the other parts of your day unless you're running around all day long. You're lifting weights or other heavy objects all day long. But one of the more attractive tools that was presented during the series with Dr. Galpin, that I adopted and found to be really effective. Is this concept of the line? The line is this concept that you have a physical location, say, at the entrance to a gym or at the start of your run or your bike or maybe it's around the stationary exercise device that you use. For which, once you cross that line, you are all about business. You're not socializing or at least not too much. You don't want to be rude to people, but you're really focused on your workout. So, this is especially effective on days when you're a little bit distracted or you didn't sleep that well the night before, maybe you got something going on in mind or in an argument or you're excited about something else. But if you care about your fitness, which I hope everyone does, and your goal during any workout is to stimulate a particular type of physiological adaptation, strength, hypertrophy, long distance endurance, etc. And you also don't want to get injured so that you can continue to train for your entire life as regularly as possible. The concept of the line is fantastic. Because what it does is it forces you to compartmentalize the portion of your life that comes before the workout and after the workout and also to really enjoy your workouts. This is something that's not often discussed, but nowadays with the advent of smartphones, there's a lot of infiltration of other types of communication and information. While one is supposed to be exercising and so our life has become far less compartmentalized than it used to be before the advent of smartphones. Now of course smartphones are wonderful. They provide all sorts of wonderful tools and benefits. And of course I use one. And I'll talk about how to incorporate the smartphone in very specific way to enhance your workouts in just a moment. But the idea of a line is you pick a location, it can change each workout, but ideally it would be at the threshold of where the physical location to the workout begins. And once you cross that line, you are all business. You are taking care of business, which is not to say that you can't enjoy your workouts. In fact, you absolutely should. One of the best pieces of advice that I ever got about fitness was given to me when I was a teenager and I started lifting weights. And the person who was teaching me how to do that said one of the best things that you can do and you absolutely should do for your fitness. Now and forever is to learn to enjoy training hard. And that really stuck with me. I really do enjoy training hard. But that was something that I learned how to do over time. I took on the mentality that I'm here by choice. I'm here for my own good and my own fitness to enhance my life. So I'm going to enjoy training hard. I'm going to enjoy training effectively. And of course there are days when I train a little less hard. When I back off quite a bit, I even take rest periods of week every once in a while every, you know, say 12 to 16 weeks. I'll take a week off and just do some, you know, activities like hiking and things that sort. I talked to all about extended layoffs, meaning a layoff of more than two days during the episode that I did by myself, which is the optimal fitness protocols episode. But in any case, learning to train hard and enjoy training hard and really making the work out something that is separate from the rest of your life is one of the most gratifying things that you can do to enhance your overall fitness. Because it really teaches you how to designate your mind and your body toward this one specific set of goals while you are there and to really enjoy the process. Because fitness can be a truly enjoyable process even when you are exerting yourself especially hard and for you, massacous self there, it can be especially because you're training hard that it feels so good. In any event, the key is to set some sort of boundary and know that when you cross into that boundary, you're training and when you cross out of that boundary, you're done training, which also lends itself to more adequate recovery and the decompression type breathing exercises that we talked about before. And I'm not going to tell you whether or not you need to do the down regulation breathing at the end of your workout within the line or after you cross the line, that's up to you. I don't think one needs to get that specific. Now another tool that's wonderfully effective, not just for your workouts, but for all areas of your life, is if you are going to bring a smart phone to your workouts to set some boundaries around what you're going to listen to and do with that smart phone during your workouts. I see people texting, I see people doing selfies, I see people having phone calls, I see people, I presume listening to music or podcasts. Look, I am not the smart phone police nor are you and everyone has a right to use their smart phone in the way that they choose as best for them in order to distract themselves or focus themselves or enrich their life. Look, it's a free world, of course, or for some then for others, but you can do what you want with your smart phone. If your goal is to improve your fitness, one of the more powerful things you can do with your smart phone is to decide before you cross the line into your workout. What you're going to listen to or do with that phone or not. So for me, I like to designate a playlist of music for that particular workout and then I just stick to that playlist. I might repeat songs that I like a lot or someone talks to me while the music's playing. I might go back and restart a song if they distracted me that sort of thing, although I do my best to not get into too much social chat during workouts. But I'm friendly and it's nice when people come over and say hello. I sometimes work out with other people in which case I don't use headphones, I don't use a smart phone. But setting a playlist or two, designating a podcast or two, designating an audio book or two, whatever it is that you're going to listen to, to really decide what that's going to be before you do your workout. The reason I say this is that I observe a lot of people and frankly, I've observed myself under conditions where suddenly in a text communication or I'm bouncing between albums or between podcasts or between whatever it is on the phone to the point where rest intervals aren't being controlled well to the point where focus during sets becomes harder to achieve at the beginning of a set because in between sets I was focused on a conversation not on training. I'm a big believer in making your exercise fun, making it accessible, meaning not so expensive or geographically difficult to achieve that you don't do it or that it starts to interfere with other areas of life. This is really important you want fitness to be blended with the rest of your life, but you don't want it so blended with the rest of your life that the rest of your life starts to impede your efforts. This happens quite often for a lot of people that work out start to take an hour and a half to hours when they could easily be completed in 45 minutes to an hour if you're just more efficient with your time. And of course you don't need me to tell you this, but smartphones can be one of the major bleeds on our focus and efficiency. In fact, it can cause you to hemorrhage focus and efficiency. So what I'm suggesting here is not throwing away your smartphone although some people do benefit from just leaving it in the car or at home when they're training. But rather to designate podcasts, books, music playlists for that particular workout and to just stick to those for the duration of your workout. And once you cross into the line, that's what you're listening to and only that or nothing. And of course once you cross back over the line as you finish your workout, you can decide to continue to listen to the podcast or continue to listen to the audio book or to the music. That's up to you, although I highly recommend that you do incorporate that down regulation period of three to five minutes minimum. The last category of tools to improve your fitness. Come from the discussions about nutrition and supplementation and recovery in the series with Dr. Andy Galpin. Now the list of tools I'm about to describe is not exhaustive, meaning it doesn't even begin to come close to the total number of tools that one could lean from the discussion about nutrition and supplementation that I had with Dr. Andy Galpin on this podcast. But they are the major ones that are definitely worth knowing. And those include supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids. Now omega-3 fatty acids are found, of course, in foods, things like fatty fish and krill, of all things, certain forms of algae, etc. But most people do not get enough of so-called EPA form of omega-3s. And for that reason, I and many other people choose to supplement with a minimum of one gram per day. And in some cases, as high as two grams per day of omega-3s in supplement form. So typically one would get to one to two grams of EPA by supplementing their nutrition, their diet, that is, with fish oil capsules or liquid fish oil. There are many different sources of these that was discussed in an episode that I did with Dr. Rhonda Patrick. I find that it's most cost efficient to get that one to two grams of EPA's from liquid fish oil. Despite what you might see on the internet, I don't have any relationship whatsoever to a liquid fish oil company. You just want to make sure that you go with a reputable brand. I like the ones that are flavored with lemon so that it offsets the taste of fish oil. And I'll take a tablespoon or two of that per day. And if I'm traveling and even if I'm not, I will often use fish oil capsules and there are variety of different sources of those. As well. Getting sufficient amounts of omega-3 has been shown to be important for mood. Okay, so as a way to offset depression, but also for enhancing overall mood. That probably relates to the omega-3s effect on neurotransmission, not just for neuromodulators like serotonin and dopamine, but for all neurotransmission. And neurotransmission, of course, is essential for neuromuscular performance. And the omega-3s have been implicated in reducing the inflammation response. Cardiovascular health, et cetera. I realize that there is some debate about omega-3s, but when I look at the bulk of literature about the omega-3s, it's very clear to me that getting one to two grams of EPA form of omega-3 per day is the right thing for me to do. And many others find that as well. The second tool to enhance your fitness under this category of nutrition and supplementation is creatine. Now again, creatine is not just found in supplement form, it's also found, of course, in foods in particular red meat. However, the amount of red meat that one would have to eat in order to get the amount of creatine that one would start to see a real performance enhancing effect is just far too high. You'd be ingesting far too much of other things in red meat that you wouldn't want that much of. And for that reason, I and many other people will take creatine daily. We now know there's no need to so-called load creatine in the old days, as it were. So old days, by the way, meaning mid-90s and 2000s, we were all told that we had to load creatine. And we had to take high dose creatine for four or five days, and then you could back off to a maintenance dose. Now it's very clear you can just take a daily dose of creatine, and that it really doesn't matter when you take that creatine. You could take it postwork out as many people do. You could take it pre-work out. It really doesn't seem to matter. I happen to take it postwork out just as a matter of habit. But again, you could take it any time of day. Now the point I want to make about creatine is one that's a bit different than the other discussions out there. I have no issue with the majority of what's discussed about creatine out there. And since that creatine model hydrate is the most effective form, fortunately in creatine, monohydrate is also the least expensive form of creatine that sold out there. I see no evidence whatsoever that the other forms of creatine are superior to creatine monohydrate. But what you'll usually hear is that taking five grams of creatine monohydrate per day is ideal for everybody. And that advice is simply not well informed by the scientific literature. If you are a larger person, so for instance, I weigh 100 kilograms, so that's about 220 pounds. Well, it turns out if you look at the literature on creatine and athletic performance, and if you look at the literature on creatine and cognitive performance, because some of you already know, creatine is a fuel, or the phosphocrytean system, is a fuel system for the brain as well. And if you look at the studies on creatine, they almost always gauge the amount of creatine to give an individual based on their body weight. So you don't have to get really specific about this, but if you weigh, say, 185 pounds to 250 pounds, you can get away with and probably should be taking 10 grams or so of creatine per day, which is what I do. Whereas if you weigh less than that, five grams or maybe even three grams is sufficient. Now, I discuss this with Dr. Andy Galpin during that series, and one of the things that I've started to do, since the closure of that series is to take more creatine per day. So now I'm taking 10, sometimes even as much as 15 grams per day of creatine. Again, this is powdered creatine monochidrate. My stomach tolerates it very well, but frankly, I don't tend to get stomach aches or gastric distress from pretty much anything unless it's, you know, some form of food poisoning, which is exceedingly rare for me. So some people out there find that creatine really disrupts their gut, and they need to take it with food, or they really need to slowly increase the amount of creatine that they're taking each day. I find that I can put 10 even 15 grams of creatine into a, you know, way protein shake or into some water with a little bit of lemon juice, just to make it taste a little less chalky drink that, and I don't have any gastric distress from that. So you'll need to find what works for you, but the point here is if you're going to take creatine, you don't just want to, quote unquote, take creatine, you know, one scoop per day. You really want to adjust the amount of creatine that you're ingesting according to your body weight. And I would give you a very specific formula of X grams of creatine per kilogram or pound of body weight, but believe it or not, no such specific recommendation has ever been published in the scientific literature, at least I couldn't find it in a way that's consistent with all the other papers, meaning you see a lot of variation. So what I'm talking about here is if you weigh 185 pounds or so, okay, plus or minus 5 pounds, out to about 250 pounds, 10 to 15 grams of creatine per day, is probably more appropriate for you than is 5 grams, meaning it's going to be more effective for enhancing physical performance, and perhaps, again, perhaps even cognitive performance as well. And if you're somebody who weighs, you know, 180 pounds down to say 130 pounds, 5 grams of creatine per day is probably sufficient. The point here is if you are taking creatine, again, not everyone has to take creatine, there's no law that says that you have to take creatine. Some people don't like it. I know some people fear it's going to make their hair fall out. We already talked about that in previous episodes and the lack of data to support that idea, but I realized some people steer away from creatine for whatever reason, but if you decide that taking creatine is right for you, adjust the total amount of creatine that you take according to your body weight. The next supplementation based tool for enhancing your fitness is Rodeola, Roséa. Now this very esoteric sounding supplement is one that I learned about both from Dr. Lee Norton, when he was a guest on this podcast, expert in nutrition and frankly training as it relates to resistance training, and from Dr. Andy Galpin. Rodeola, Roséa, is a supplement that's gaining increasing attention because it is what's called a cortisol modulator. It does not necessarily suppress cortisol. It does not increase cortisol. It's a cortisol modulator. And frankly, the mechanism by which Rodeola, Roséa, modulates cortisol is still under investigation. I hope to do an episode about it in the future, at least make it part of an episode, because the hypothesized mechanism that's starting to emerge is really interesting as it relates to neurons in the brain, that control the stress response, and glands in the body like the adrenals that control the stress response, and that secrete cortisol. Regardless, there's a growing body of research that has explored Rodeola, Roséa supplementation, and one's subjective perception of fatigue or output during high intensity training of various kinds, both resistance training as well as running an endurance type training. So, I started taking Rodeola, Roséa, about six months ago, in response to conversations that I had, again, with Dr. Lee Norton and with Dr. Andy Galpin. And it's a supplement that I take before high intensity workouts. So, I don't take it before run, because frankly, my runs either very long and slow, or they're very brief, like a high-intensity interval training session, and I find those to be pretty easy to recover from, even though they are very intense. I might take Rodeola, Roséa supplement before doing a 30-minute hill run, that's very intense, but typically, I only take it about 10 to 15 minutes before any sort of high intensity resistance training session, particularly my leg day, which falls on day two of my exercise protocol, or the torso day, or the small body parts day, again, here I'm referencing the way that I train across the week, and you can find that training protocol as a downloadable, completely zero-cost PDF if you like, but I realize other people are using different body parts splits and different combinations of resistance training and endurance training. The reason I mention Rodeola, Roséa, in this episode, is that I realize that, while some people might not yet be supplementing Omega-3s, they might not be supplementing creatine, there are many of you who are already doing those things, and you're looking for additional tools to give you an edge. So again, the Rodeola Roséa would not fall into the category of foundational supplements, certainly get your nutrition right, get your sleep right, get your sunlight, all the basics first, please, before you've been thinking about any supplements. However, once you get into the category of supplements that can enhance fitness, Rodeola Roséa does seem to have some good research to support it in the context of lots of different forms of high intensity exercise. Now, I can't tell you whether or not it's purely subjective or whether or not it's objective and subjective, but my experience has been that when I take Rodeola Roséa, I definitely notice that I can exert myself harder without feeling like I'm bringing myself to the brink of fatigue, either during the exertion or afterwards. I feel like I can do more work without feeling so exhausted, and I feel as if I'm recovering from my workouts more quickly, in particular across the day after my workouts. In fact, if I had to cite one specific subjective effect that I've experienced from taking Rodeola Roséa before very high intensity workouts, is that prior to taking it, I would often find that three or four hours after the workout, having eaten a good meal, taking a shower, et cetera, and I was tired of a real dip in energy. But now I notice that I have a lot of energy throughout the day, even after these very high intensity sessions in the early part of the day. And frankly, I haven't changed anything else about my supplementation or my nutrition, at least nothing major. So I personally am going to continue to take Rodeola Roséa before these high intensity workouts. So for me, that's about two or three times per week. However, if I forgot to take Rodeola Roséa before workout, I have no reason to think that that workout would go much worse. This is a supplement that is designed to give you an edge to be able to exert more focus and intensity during your workouts, with less perceived exertion and to enhance your recovery. The typical dosage of Rodeola Roséa that you'll find in most supplements is 100 to 200 milligrams. And of course, any time you're going to take a new supplement, you would be wise to figure out the lowest effective dose from that supplement. That's just logic, right? Why spend more money taking more of something that you don't need more of if you could get away with taking less of it. And it's just as effective, maybe even more effective. So I typically will take 100 to 200 milligrams of Rodeola Roséa about 10 to 20 minutes before a workout. However, I've taken as little as 100 milligrams on a consistent basis, and frankly, I don't really experience much difference, whether I take 100 milligrams or I take 200 milligrams before a workout. So lately, I've just defaulted to taking 100 milligrams of Rodeola Roséa before any high intensity workout. Now, the final tool that I want to review for improving your fitness comes from the category of nutrition. Done lots of episodes about nutrition already on this podcast. We've done episodes about intermittent fasting. I did a long interview episode with Dr. Lane Norton, where we discussed all the ins and outs of nutrition as it relates to fat loss, muscle gain. Fitness in general, lifestyle in general. So check out that episode where you will learn his philosophy on nutrition, which frankly is the one that I largely subscribe to, of course, obeys the laws of thermodynamics, calories in calories out, being fundamentally important. But also gets into all sorts of details about which sources of protein are most effective and bio-available, how much protein you can incorporate into your muscles after training, etc. All of that is included in that episode. With that said, the series on exercise with Dr. Andy Galpin also included an episode on nutrition. And while having the discussion for that episode and then listening to that episode again, I realized that, well, certainly I've gotten a number of things right about my nutrition across the years. There are a few areas where I could probably do better without much effort in ways that could really enhance my fitness. And the thing that I'm referring to is that for me, my first meal of the day, lay on somewhere around 11 a.m. maybe 12 noon. Sometimes I'll eat in a earlier breakfast, but most typically I hydrate and caffeinate and train in the morning and then I eat some time around 11 or 12. And then I eat my last meal of the day, some time around 830 or 9. And as some of you already know, I tend to organize my meals such that meals during the early part of the day, tend to lean more toward protein and fiber-scarber hydrates, so things like meat and salad, chicken and salad, fish and salad, and maybe a little bit of starch. And the meals that I ate later in the day tend to be more starch-focused and more vegetable-focused, things like pasta rice, etc. later in the day because it helps me sleep. And the architecture of all that is really about energy and focus, I find I can focus a bit better and I have more energy throughout the day. When I have my first meal at around 11 or 12, and I keep the total amount of carbohydrates that I ingest during the day, moderate, not low, but moderate. Now there is an exception to that, which is if I do a high intensity resistance training session early in the morning, say train legs or train torso or even small body parts early in the morning, then I make sure to incorporate more starchy carbohydrates and some fruit, some simple sugars as well, into the first meal of the day so that I can replenish the glycogen that I depleted during those high intensity resistance training sessions. However, after talking to Dr. Andy Galpin, I realized that I really shouldn't worry about or be afraid of eating something before training, if I'm really hungry in the morning. So what I'm referring to here are the times in which I wake up, and I want to train, but I personally like to train fasted and caffeinated. Okay? Yes, I do recommend that people delay their caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking. If and only if you have trouble with an afternoon crash, you know, real fatigue in the afternoon, then it makes sense to delay your caffeine. 90 to 120 minutes after waking. However, the exception to that is that if I'm going to train early in the day, I do ingest water to hydrate as well as electrolytes, and caffeine prior to training, and sometimes that means I'm drinking caffeine within 30 minutes or 60 minutes of waking. Try to be clear about this in previous episodes, but I think a number of people have come to think that I always delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking, and that's simply not the case. If I'm going to train in particular, if I'm going to do high intensity resistance training or a long run, I will ingest caffeine sooner than 90 to 120 minutes after waking. And in addition to that, yes, I tend to eat my first meal around 11 am, maybe 12 noon. But if I wake up and I'm very hungry, I will eat a small meal that includes typically some protein and some fats, so some Brazil nuts, maybe a couple of scoops of weight protein, would be typical for me, or maybe even a little bit of oatmeal. It's a weight protein, not a lot of food in my gut, but after talking to Dr. Andy Galpin, what I learned was for some people training fasted feels best. I would consider myself one of those people. You may be somebody in that category as well, or you might be somebody who really feels as if you run best, you resistance trained best when you've eaten, say 90 minutes or a couple hours before you do that. There are basically no specific rules as it relates to whether or not you train fasted or train fed, except what you can handle in terms of gastric distress, so you want to make food choices according to that and try and avoid, of course, gastric distress. But basically the change that I've made is if I wake up and I'm hungry, I'll eat a small meal, or if I want to work out in the afternoon or I have to work out in the afternoon and I have lunch at, say 12 or 12, or 30 or 11 am, and the only opportunity that I have to train is 1 pm or even 12, 30, I will go ahead and train. And that's a new thing for me. Typically I tried to keep my meals at least 3 to 4 hours prior to any training bout, and of course if you're sleeping all night, you're not eating and then if you wake up and you don't eat, and you train in the morning, that's certainly longer than 3 or 4 hours unless you're sleeping very, very little, frankly. So essentially what I'm saying is figure out what works best for you. Do you prefer to train fasted or fed? For some of you, you might prefer fasted before cardio and fed before resistance training. For some of you, it might be fasted, is always best. Again, I put myself in that category. For some of you, it might be fed is always best. Again, this is highly individual, and that's another point that I'm trying to make here, which is, Dr. Galpin really impressed upon me that there is no hard and fast rule about training fasted or fed. And this is the second point that having some flexibility in whether or not you can train fasted or fed, allows you to incorporate your fitness training sessions more readily into a shifting schedule. And that's a really overarching theme of everything we've been discussing today, which is, yes, it's wonderful and important to have a core fitness program, something that you're really striving to do each and every week. And for me, that's three sessions of cardio, three resistance training sessions, and a day where I'm doing thermal stress training, which is just fancy language for deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure. However, real life happens, travel, work, illness, family, all the sorts of things that can impinge on an exercise schedule, and make it less likely that one would complete their workouts. So today we've been discussing tools to improve your fitness, which are brief, easy to incorporate, scientifically supported, and that are shown to improve the various sorts of exercise adaptations and recovery that will allow you to get the most progress from your schedule. So while the tools that we discussed today relate to breathing, they relate to nutrition, they relate to supplementation, they relate to specific set and rep patterns and cadences and rest periods, etc. All of those specific recommendations are within a larger container that I hope has become clear, which is the best tools to improve your fitness, are the tools that of course are going to be effective in improving your cardiovascular and strength and hyper-to-re-training, etc. Whatever it is that your goals are, but also tools that are going to make it easier and more likely that you are going to engage in your fitness program with enthusiasm, with effort and with focus. And as with any episode of this podcast, I covered a lot of information, and there are a lot of different tools that one could incorporate. By no means you need to incorporate them all, although if you choose to, that's wonderful. Just even incorporating one or two of them, say incorporating this notion of the line and the exercise snacks, or adjusting your level of flexibility as to whether or not you train faster to your Fed and the line, or trying a 12-week cycle, a purely training for strength when you do your resistance training. But whether or not you pick one tool or all the tools or somewhere in between, the key thing is to actually implement them. And I like to think that during today's discussion provided a number of tools, again, largely gleaned from the episode series with Dr. Andy Galpins. And again, if you haven't seen that series, that's linked in the show note captions. Those episodes are long. There are six of them, but they are a wealth of information of every aspect of fitness. During today's episode, we're really just talking about the things that you can, and I do believe should, bring to your existing fitness program that can really make a positive difference without a lot of effort.

vid00002," Welcome to the Human Lab guest series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and optymology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks the sixth and final of the sixth episode series on fitness exercise and performance. And today's discussion is all about nutrition and supplementation to maximize your fitness exercise and performance goals. Dr. Andy Yelpin. I'm super excited to discuss today's topic which is nutrition and supplementation for performance and recovery. And I'm particularly excited about this conversation because I've been interested in supplementation and nutrition for performance really since my teens. But also because in recent years we've witnessed a massive transformation in the general public in terms of their view of supplementation and nutrition. And while more people are thinking about nutrition, what is good nutrition, what is not a very barbed wire topic, as you know, but there are some truths in there that we'll discuss. But also supplementation. You know, whereas 10, 15 years ago, I think most people would either be really into supplements. That was a small percentage of people. But the majority of people were either told or were thinking, oh, you know, vitamins, you mostly excrete them. They're just expensive urine. Nowadays, it seems that many people, including many of my colleagues and physicians, all the way down to sports performance experts, are taking and making recommendations about certain supplements. And so the way that I like to think about supplements is that they aren't necessarily just supplements, which makes it sound like they are augmenting what should already be there, but you're not quite getting enough of. But indeed, a lot of these things we call supplements are very potent compounds that can transform our ability to perform in the short term, to recover from exercise and that can really shape brain chemistry, hormone patterns, acutely and when taken long term. So I'm very excited about today's topic and to be able to try and sort through this, let's call it a cloud, hopefully not a storm, but this cloud of supplements that are out there because indeed, many of them are excellent. And can provide us a lot. Some of them are terrible. And then some just don't do anything and therefore are terrible because either they have side effects or because they're very expensive and they don't do anything. And then of course within the realm of nutrition, there's an equal amount of confusion, but that's why I'm talking to you because you're going to put clarity and structure and definition on these incredibly important topics. You absolutely nailed it there. One of the major reasons supplements can work is because you can consume nutrients and extremely high concentrations such that you would not get in nature through food. Having said that you really do want to focus on the basic sleep nutrition hydration and I'm going to get into very specific detail later with some of those things. That said, there are plenty of situations and circumstances when supplementation can do exactly what you said. Also though, because you are taking them in such high concentrations, they can also be unproductive, they can be destructive or they can be counterproductive. So in case if you're taking a couple of supplements over here, it may actually be counteracting the benefits of some of the other supplements over there. So in the ideal situation, we would be able to work like a cypress here. You would be able to run full biological testing. So extensive blood work and saliva and urine and stool and have an end up analysis of your gut microbiome and your stress patterns and your time of day and your cortisol curve and like all the things that we do in our high performance folks. In fact, then we can get extremely high precision supplementation and quite honestly our philosophy is we only give individuals exactly what they need. So even some of the standard generally safe and effective supplements, we don't really necessarily use them if there is no specific need. We've talked about the consequences of this with things like antioxidants, but even simple stuff like stimulants and other tools that are effective for recovery, we don't use them unless we have a reason. That said, that's not the reality for a lot of people. They're not going to be able to do something like that or work somebody can help them in that. So there are a handful of supplements that I would consider to be in my 8020 rule, which is sort of like the 20% of supplements that are going to give you 80% of the benefit for the lowest cost. And so what I can actually use is sort of start there, even though this burns my skin and my soul a little bit, I absolutely hate this. I am the context guy. I'm the it depends it's high precision guy, but let's be real. There are a number of supplements that are fairly effective and fairly cheap for a wide range of outcomes. So this is for general public. This is for people who want to do the three buckets, right? You want to look a certain way. So supplements that can enhance muscle growth and fat loss, non hormonal based supplements, of course. Supplements that can improve energy or physical performance. Again, from everything from squatting more to feeling better in your yoga class to having my energy throughout the day. To our third major bucket that we've been talking about throughout this entire series, which are longevity. So we can cover those first if you'd like to start there. Yes, absolutely. Let's start there. Oftentimes when we think of supplements, we immediately jump to high sport performance type of things or vigorous workouts or muscle building. Though that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. Take for example, creatine. I've spoken about this at length. Thanks for what they are in Darren Cannell who's done a tremendous amount of research. I was just up at his lab recently in Canada. And he has covered extensively. In fact, I think I put up a post perhaps I could draw this up where he laid out all the myriad of benefits of creatine. This is taken in the typically three to five grams per day of dose of creatine model hydrate, which has the most research behind it. It seems to be extremely low side effects in almost anyone. And the benefits include in course things like muscle performance and strength and things like that. And if you go back to our discussion or episode on metabolism and endurance, we talked about the phosphoric creatine system. So you can figure out kind of what this is going to do in terms of effect. That said, there's excellent information and data coming out known on the benefits of bone mineral density and creatine. There's a ton of work looking at a host of cognitive factors from memory, executive function, to effects potentially on even things like depression, mood to Alzheimer's Parkinson's, all forms of neurodegenerative disease. In fact, it's pretty obvious the brain loves creatine as a fuel. And so we were sort of discussed in the episode as being the fuel for skeletal muscle contraction, but the brain needs to do that as well. The astrocytes are on the brain need to be able to write energy etc. So it's very clear that metabolism in the brain is reduced with things like TBI and potentially concussions. So now to be extremely clear, creatine does not prevent any of those diseases. It does not treat any of them and the data are mixed, but it's more and more are coming. Some show a little bit of benefits, some show maybe none, but I'm not aware of any research in those areas that show it has any downside. For the most part, side effects are extremely minimal if not null and then potentially some benefit depending on the specific study. So we could put up a if you'd like a couple of links directly to those meta analyses and folks can go through those things one by one. I only say that to again, maybe expand our understanding or thinking about what these types of supplements can do. It's not just about growing muscle or you know high performance. It's everything to again, there's an association with recovery. So creatine is fantastic for recovery from muscle from muscle damage helps and can potentially aid in fat loss and a whole host of things. So you can actually also even look at websites like examin.com. I have no affiliation with them whatsoever, but if you want to just type in something like creatine on a hydrate, you can see a whole list. And you're going to see thousands of studies of the potential benefits of creatine. So that is always number one on my list. I'm relieved to hear that creatine sits at the top of your supplementation list because well, first of all, I started taking it when I was in college. That time I was taking it in this kind of loading mode where you take it in anywhere from 15 to 25 grams per day often causing some gastroids distress. Often combining with fruit juice to try and shut it into the muscles. And then so called maintenance phase of reducing to 10 or 15 grams per day. Nowadays, I just take about five grams or so, although later, I know you're going to tell me why I should probably be taking more than five grams per day. Give it my body weight. So I know we'll get into some of those specifics a little bit later. But in addition to experiencing direct effects on muscle size and strength, which I did, I don't know how it contributed to my cognitive function, or if it does now, because there's really no way to tease that out with standard at home tests like a scale. But it is very clear to me based on the literature that you described and some of which we've covered on other episodes of the podcast that the phosphocreating system is vitally important for for brain function, right? The for brain, of course, being the portion of brain broadly speaking, the portion of brain just behind your forehead that is responsible for planning action, setting rules and context. So even as simple as if you're going down field in a game of soccer, basketball and you're on offense, and then you make an attempt on goal or basket, and then it switches and you go back now you're on defense that being on defense is very different than being on offense. And that goal is to listen to me that that rule switching is a prefrontal cortical function as is every context dependent way of thinking or acting. And so anything that can favor function of the for brain, I think is good for humans in general, it suppresses anxiety allows us to interpret what's going on for us. And so I'm very relieved and gratified to hear that creatine sits at the top of the list. Also as I'm sure you'll point out again later, creatine is for the most part a relatively affordable supplement for most people. So here we're not talking about something that's really esoteric or that you have to you know fly to some remote location to get in infusion of. Right, but that's I apologize to all you because I know the price has skyrocketed recently really yeah. Why is that I think it's a well nobody else, but it's quote unquote a supply and demand issue if you will so those prices have gone up there's also of course been shipping problems in the world and things so every time I talk about creatine right now people just flame me. For like oh my god it's so expensive now I'm like I don't I'm sorry, but honestly it's only so expensive because you're used to being so cheap. So when you when you counter the fact that you're like right yeah like relative to the other stuff you're probably taking relative to any other number of purchases. For the it still lands very high my ROI list my you know my 80 20 because of that is it's. It can be taken any time of the day it doesn't have to be in magical combination you talked about co ingesting with carbohydrates that can enhance how quickly can get into the system is fact it's it's going to work on the exact same as in mechanisms will probably potentially talk about hydration. But these things are shuttle so anytime you're bringing carbohydrate that's going to. The ship into tissues quickly as it can. Creating then goes long for the right and then it brings water for the right that's how you enhance hydration that's why it's important to have carbohydrates when you're trying to hydrate. So you're just going to take it in there and that's also why you get quote unquote sell swelling. Which is a good thing like you're it's just enhancing hydration we actually use it a ton in our post way in protocols so individuals that have to cut water weight. Creatines a great thing to throw back in there. It's going to help you rehydrate. It's also why when you take 30 grams of it. It can pull a bunch of fluid in the intestines and and there you go with your little bit of GI distress so. Yeah, there's a lot of fun things you can talk about there. I just had to flag that because every time I've been talking about recently and I say it's cheap people are killing me for it. So I apologize. I don't know how to make it in cheaper, but it's still fairly fairly affordable. Yeah, I would say relatively inexpensive compared to a lot of supplements out there and when thinking about the return on investment is it's quite good. Yeah, so that actually sorry it's already it's cut you up. But I was also thinking there's been a number of studies on sleep deprivation as well. Creating that can help so obviously sleep deprivation will generally reduce cognitive function and creating can ameliorate some of that drop. So if you think about it in that context, I had a crummy night asleep. Well, and if that enables you to perform a little bit better in your job than you would make up the dollar or so whatever you paid for that day's supply of creatine. So it is something I kind of on that note. It's not going to work as an acute response. So it's not something you're like, I feel terrible. I'll throw some creatine down the hatch. I'll feel better that that's not going to work. It's going to take several weeks to have a noticeable effect. It needs to be stored in tissue. It needs to be built up before you can actually do much of anything. So it is unlike some of the other things like stimulants or caffeine that have an acute response right now. And so if you're going to take it, you probably need to consume it consistently. If you can't do that, then really there's no point in doing it. And the loading phase you mentioned in distance or here is something you can do. Again, if you need to enhance the storage of it really quickly. So say for example, we've done this in some military cases where it's like you get back to base and you've only got a week and then you got to go back out. We may actually have to do a little bit of a loading phase then. But if that's not the case, the loading phase is unnecessary. It's not really harmful other than maybe GIS stress and maybe waste. But you're going to have three or four weeks. It's going to reach full saturation. Plenty of time to be there in that if you're in that three to seven grams per day range. So that you mentioned the slow accumulating positive effects of creatine as compared to so called acute effects. Because the way that I think of health promoting a performance enhancing protocols like viewing morning sunlight or endurance exercise for that matter or creatine or sleep. Is that while they can have effects in the immediate term, you might feel a little bit or in the case of a good night sleep a lot better. It's really the cumulative effect of raising your baseline level of functioning. You know, there's another way think about is these supplements or behaviors and quality nutrition when done consistently over time and that doesn't mean a hundred percent of the time. But you know probably 80 percent of the time. Lead to a sort of buoyancy in your system that allows you to be more resilient under conditions where conditions aren't perfect. Right. And if conditions are made perfect or closer perfect and you already have that buoyancy, that's when you really start to see the ultra high performance effects that are so much fun. But they have to be established through consistent supplementation consistent nutritional intake. So today I know we're going to distinguish between. Normally they're called chronic and acute effects, but that makes it sound like chronic illness. The moment people hear chronic, well, they might think of other things, but in the context of health, they typically think of chronic illness and we're not talking about that. What we're talking about is slow, modular, Tory effects in the body. A lot of things in the body take time to build up, but once they've built up, they clearly can benefit us. And then other things, as you mentioned, you know, a stimulant, for instance, has a very acute effect that is going to occur with, you know, peak within 30 minutes and we're off within, you know, four hours or so can also have some chronic effects, but typically it's a short lived effect. So we just want to frame up the language that we'll be using and I'm really excited to dive into this topic and I think creatine is a beautiful example of a supplement that has positive chronic mental and physical benefits. Down the road, I can come back and talk a little bit more about creatine and we can cover some other information regarding best practices for getting the most out of it, as well as we'll certainly dive into some of the common side effects or at least a thought of side effects. While we're here though, I also could throw in a few other of these high impact low cost generally safe things that are my 80, 20 rule if you will. So the way I actually kind of think about it is you want one from each of three categories. And these categories are fuel. Stimulant and fatigue blockers. So creatine is actually in the fuel. It's not a stimulant. We talked about it through chronic effect there. So we've already knocked that one off. Another one from the fatigue blocker is going to be anything like beta alanine or sodium bicarbonate. And then from the stimulant use, of course we have anything like a beetroot juice to a caffeine or something of the equivalent. So we can come back and get to talk about all those in more detail a little bit later. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research roles at Stanford. It is also separate for Dr. Andy Galpins teaching in research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is however part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is momentous. Momentous makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The human-min lab podcast is proud to be partnering with momentous for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations. With single ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, momentous supplements ship internationally. This is of course important because we realize that many of the human-min lab podcasts listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the human-min lab podcast, in particular supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery, you can go to live-momentous spelled OUS, so that's live-momentous.com slash human-min. Today's episode is also brought to us by levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor. Many people are aware that their blood sugar, that is their blood glucose level, is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and and indeed aging of the brain and body. Most people do not know however, how different foods and different activities, including exercise, were different temperature environments impact their blood glucose levels, and yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things. I first started using levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods exercise and timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night impact my blood glucose levels. I've learned a tremendous amount from using levels. It's taught me when best to eat, what best to eat, when best to exercise, how best to exercise, and how to modulate my entire schedule from work to exercise and even my sleep. So if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link slash huberman. That's a levels at dot link slash huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by element. Element is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium to optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance. Most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best. But what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of ourselves and nerve cells neurons in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios. Now, of course, people with pre-hypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake. But what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise and in particular if you're falling a very clean diet, that is not a lot of processed foods, which of course is a good thing. Chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drink element that's lmnt.com slash huberman to get a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drink element lmnt.com slash huberman to claim a free sample pack. I want to ask you about something that as soon as I say it, some people might roll their eyes or wonder why are we even talking about that now. But that I have to believe is among the more fundamental, if not foundational aspects of nutrition and supplementation for performance and that's hydration. I think we hear hydrations like okay, we have to drink six day glasses of water every day. Our urine should be relatively clear if it's too dark yellow or not doing a job of hydrating enough. How much of that is true is alkaline water worthwhile for changing the alkalinity of my body. I learned when I was in college and graduate school that the alkalinity of the different tissues in your body is very well controlled in order to keep you alive. And that you don't want it to shift too much or you can enter pretty horrible states of seizure vomiting and even death. So tell me about hydration and woven into that if you would educate me on electrolytes and hydration because I think most often when people ingest electrolytes, sure they could be ingesting salt tablets. Probably getting some electrolytes by the way electrolytes sodium mannes and potassium through their food. I think most people think about drinking electrolytes. So water and electrolytes I think is a vitally important topic to kick this off with. Sure, we can jump right into your alkaline water while there is perhaps much to say about this. We can maybe revisit this in another seven part series on its own. I would just say this way. There's probably a few things you should do before worrying about the alkalinity of your water and I'll just leave it at that. Meaning the alkalinity of water is sort of irrelevant not that you won't go that far is just it's probably remember we started off talking about 8020. Well this would be in mind like 991 in terms of like. We're really at the level of worrying about the pH of their drinking fluid we have optimized so many other things that then we can talk about it. But until we have nailed months and years of work on other things this is not going to make much of an impact. Great then perhaps you could tell us about what volume of water we should be drinking when we should be drinking that water relative to training and just generally. And anything else related to water and electrolytes that can improve mental performance physical performance and offset any you know ill effects. I like the fact that you mentioned physical and mental performance because it's clear in both cases we hear that we need to drink more water and I can give you some numbers and I will on a second. What we also need to recognize is there's this is how we talk about how we say a few episodes ago and this is the case right whether we talked about food or hydration or I think I gave you the example cyanide. Naturally occurring in your food hot water is the same way so if you are under hydrated or dehydrated. And there is a clear negative effect on your body and as I increase the level or improve the level of hydration things get better whether this is physical performance or whether this is mental performance in fact we know that. You can see body weight reduction of as low as 2% via dehydration so imagine you're doing about a vector size and you're sweating and you lose 2% of your body weight that alone is enough to reduce accuracy and performance so the classic study we talk about here was in basketball players so shooting accuracy so free throw shooting I think is specifically what they looked at. I think it reduction in performance with as little as 2% dehydration that that level you also see a significant increase in perception of difficulty of exercise and so only right at 2%. I think about I say 2% I mean percent body weight lost right that's what that means you start getting the 3% 4% 5% dehydration you start having a significant reduction in blood volume and that's incredibly important for endurance. You're blood becomes viscous it's hard to pump through and you're going to start having all kinds of issues so being dehydrated is again not only going to reduce performance but because of the mental aspect which we just walk through. You're going to lose accuracy you're going to lose total endurance performance and you're going to lose speed and power so we have the trial out there no matter what you're interested in it's going to be harmed by being dehydrated that also is happening then if you're starting your program dehydrated. So if you're already 1% or so dehydrated maybe you're like a little under hydrated and you lose a little bit of sweat you've already hit that 2% and so we're starting to see reductions in performance there the same happens on the other side of that or met a curve. So if you are optimally hydrated in some large window but you start going past that we can start running into equal problems remember there's a there is a need for an optimal concentration of sodium and potassium and chloride between your cell inside your cell outside yourself. These are electrolytes this is what we call osmolality and osmolarity is really good. Think of it like concentration and osmosis if you remember those terms. So if we are trying to create a muscle contract and that requires an electrical gradient and so sodium and potassium. Specifically in magnesium calcium or positively charged and chloride is negatively charged and we need to have a certain amount inside the cell and outside the cell so that the positive and the negatives are balanced appropriately. So the when we move one we change the voltage and we have in the case of a muscle contraction. Okay, I just came through a whole lot of physiology there to say if you then go mess with fluid only and you say if I were to give you a bowl of three liters of pure water right now you're going to dilute your blood and so there's not going to be as many chemical. There won't be as many electrical signals in there because you've taken the same amount of sodium potassium and saturate and put it in a larger volume pure water. So that gradient is now changed that becomes a significant problem for contraction. I mean quite literally it can kill you this is what we call hypo netremia so no tremia is spelled n a hypo being low hypo netremia if you actually go to the periodic chart n a is what we use for sodium. So hypo it's because the word is netremia actually so that what that literally means is low sodium and you didn't get that from sweating out of your sodium you actually get hypo netremia from drinking into much water. So it's not that the total amount of sodium gets low it's the fact that the concentration gets low from excessive fluid intake. So in the extremes in fact if you look at the literature you'll see anywhere between like two to 15% of people who finish and during sources are in the hypo netremia and that varies wildly if you're doing iron man and cone versus like. You know, marathon and Denver and in October right it's going to be totally different depending on other conditions, but these are all important. So while like death happens that is sort of extreme if you back up just a little bit you start seeing the same types of performance elements in fact the symptoms can be identical brain fog confusion performance irritation agi distress and you think man these are symptoms of dehydration so then you drink more water and you're just exacerbating the problem and I can actually. Give you one little example of this. We had an executive actually female CEO. I'll say she's probably when her was in her early 40s. And so she came to us and she thought man for sure she has some sort of gut problem going on because we hear a lot about kind of gut health and how it affects everything and so she says like I have brain fog and I've done all these things and I got blood work done and everything's fine like that's what's going on. I think I must have some sort of good thing going on or whatever and it's okay and we just started going through her stuff and she was I think about 170 pounds plus or minus and she was consuming like 250 to 60 ounces of water a day. That's a ton of water and we were like holy shit what are you doing this for and she says like I that's sort of like my thing is but she didn't realize it was more like a nervous tick than it was anything else right she just like ships of ships of ship ship water. I'm like man how often do you go page she's like yeah like every you know 30 minutes or something. I'm like fantastic sleep problems focus and so she's smashing caffeine she was at like eight cups of coffee a day which is also going to add just to excretion of sodium totally right. So it's like okay we don't really need to come in and run a sleep study on you. We're just going to lower your water and she was like what we dropped her down to like 180 so basically an ounce per pound of body weight which is still high because she did train 180 ounces correct. She does work out so she needed to replenish some stuff and we'll cover these numbers in a second. Institainy's aiming like two days in she's like oh my god I haven't slept six straight hours in years and then after that it was like. Basically tears coming back to us right my focus my brain fog is gone because she's in a very high pressure job. It's like everything's coming back like now she was down to three or so cups at half a day blah blah blah like the whole thing digestion improved all of it. She was like they're only problem after all the analyses when she was just drinking way way too much water and adding more salt to her. Wouldn't not have solved the problem because she would have just had simply way too much fluid and her system she was having all kinds of ADHD problems and I'll do so and like the whole thing and then that that rose in it cortisol. The whole like system gets goes into chaos so it is important that you pay attention to hydration even though as you sort of mentioned people tend to just kind of like roll their eyes around it because if you're in the middle it's fine. But if you're anywhere past not even the extreme extremes but just that first energy deviation away. You're going to have problems and you might be thinking adrenal fatigue you might be thinking your testosterone like you're going to think all these things and you simply just haven't actually dialed in your hydration. Yeah. I think people sometimes roll their eyes at the discussion of hydration because it just doesn't sound very sexy it's not like doesn't sound like a neurotransmitter or hormone it is sound like testosterone or estrogen or DHA or dopamine. But it actually is all of those things it sits at a level beneath all of those but not beneath on a hierarchy beneath in terms of a foundation it's actually the without proper electrolyte balance and hydration none of the cells of the body can function and then I think people also hear that oh you know we are 70% water and somehow like that statistic alone or that fact alone doesn't seem to. Stimulate any kind of action will take away it's like great you know like gravity also you know keeps us you know from jumping as eyes we like you know what do I do and so I think. It's it's important that people understand that every cellular process in the body critically relies on having. Enough sodium magnesium potassium around and the the way that it's concentrated in fluid water is really the way that you allow every cell in their body to function as well as it possibly could and respond to all the sorts of kind of quote a quote high performance tools. And then we're talking about the other thing I've observed many times over is that if people are ingesting too much water and also drinking a lot of caffeine and their electrolytes are low. They get shaky and they actually can have anxiety like symptoms. So when people come into my lab to just study zoning anxiety and fear we ask a few questions and those questions include how much water they've had that day. Also a sort of bizarre fact but one that I think is worth mentioning is that when the bladder is full it stimulates a sort of anxiety. If you ever had to urinate very badly and you're in the car or you can't urinate and then you get to the door like that's talk about anxiety. And that's because there's a direct neural pathway from the bladder that registers the mechanocensors how much stretch there is on the bladder that sends a signal to the brainstem alertness. Areas broadly speaking, locusts are really us and others. That wake us up these are the when we're awake it makes us more awake and when we're asleep this is what wakes us up to urinate in the middle of the night. Yeah, that's actually why you can use night urination as a pretty good diagnostic of sleep disorders. So if because of vasopressant right I'm exactly what you're talking about if you're having sleep disorder issues in your staying awake and vasopressant gets taken off right in api and goes straight to the kidneys. Your kidneys are supposed to be dormant basically at night you're not supposed to be filtering a lot of you're in a night. If that's happening and say you you have any number of api is kicking on or anything going on. Vasopressant keeps going keep sending signal getting started filtering so if you're waking up and being multiple times a night that's called nocturrea. That is a very very good sign that either one of two things happen you one you have some sort of sleep disorder or two you're drinking outrageous amounts of water. And so that's actually a bit of a backwards cycle now right because you're drinking way too much water you waking up and being on night that's actually ruining your sleep. And so we have seen this a number of times with our sleep company as we go in and it's just like you don't need any this crap. You just need to be properly hydrated alternatively if your hydration is sounding you're still waking up more than one time a night to pee on average. Then you almost I shouldn't say like that but there's a potential that you actually have some sort of sleep disorder or sleep condition going in so the rule of thumb on that this or here. Once or night once a night or so of your nation is fine if it is routinely or consistently more than two. You need to make some adjustments start with hydration it's the simplest way right getting a full sleep study done just figure out hydration we've had this happen. A number of times where people want to get more health conscious and they just get they hear things like this and they're like I got to get in my water and then they just start trying to wrecking their sleep. And then waking it up so if you're waking up multiple times and you're urinating and it is a large amount of urine for you and it is clear that's probably not sleep up the induced noctaria that's probably excessive hydration if you're waking up a bunch of times. And it's fairly small amounts of urine then it's probably not the fluid issue it's probably the fact that the basic press and is kicking your kidneys into gear so that's not a perfect criteria but it is just like a quick little tool you can sort of use. That's actually one of the reasons why we measure almost always your body weight at night as well as in the morning so that's the combat sport and the UFC fighter's boxers we call that your float so much you float it overnight. I like to know that number because I want to know as well your first morning void so when you wake up then you went to bed at 200 pounds you woke up the next morning at 195. Oh you floated five pounds did you pee last night yeah yeah three times interesting. Another case you woke up you went to bed at 200 pounds you wake up at 199.5. Okay you're dehydrated because you should have a certain amount of fluid that you're just resturing out as you're breathing throughout your nose or night ideally. I'm like guaranteed you gonna wake up what was your urine like oh yeah little bit pretty dark like shocker you're dehydrated so you can kind of look at numbers like that a general float is something like a pound to two pounds for the 170 plus pound person as you scale up that number. Can go up a little bit but you can kind of use these to triage a little bit about what's going on with this kind of combination everything is everything right so it's not just about one system so you're going to pay attention you can also look. I don't we if you want to jump into it we can but there's a whole bunch of ways I can teach you to diagnose hydration and maybe we can start there and then we can talk about hydration numbers. Yes I'd love to talk about diagnostics for hydration over hydration dehydration. To start off would you be willing to give us some numbers how much water should we be drinking. The classic rule here and you're making me do what I hate right I want to give all the caveats first but I'll go straight to your number half an ounce per pound of body weight is a rough rule. So a few way again 200 pounds that would mean you drink a hundred ounces of water a day most water bottles are like. 12 to 20 ounces something like that so you know you're in a drinking six of those or so a day kind of like plus or minus which is not that unreasonable. This does depend on a number of factors which I could go over but that is a rough starting place the only other thing to add to that is that does not account for exercise induced water loss. Or sauna or anything like that so that's assuming just like basal daily needs. If you are exercising or sweating at all for any reasons or work related so folks at work outside or in the heater. A humid environment these numbers all change and you can slide this scale up but you generally want to drink about 125% of the fluids you've lost during that physical activity back. How much do you lose per hour of exercise that number ranges between one to five pounds depending on the person nicknip and be higher with some of our athletes like I think of a number of NFL players right now it's not uncommon for those guys to do eight or nine pounds. Even not even like crazy circumstances if it's August and Warren Jacksonville. It's not wild for those guys to go nine ten pounds. What about the typical person who goes to a air condition gym or goes out for a run on a day that is somewhere between let's say 55 degrees Fahrenheit and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. You're probably looking at like a pound. It's not extremely high if you are totally soaked. Might be like a pound and a half the two pounds if you're like come back and like your pits are a little sweaty and there's a little bit of water kind of under neckline or. It's probably like a more like a pound or so so in that case you might drink back a pound and a half of water. Okay, so just to review these numbers to make sure that I'm on the correct page here. A half an ounce of fluid per pound of body weight is a sort of a foundation for hydration. And then you want to replace a hundred and twenty five percent of the fluid lost during exercise and exercise varies where exercise is done varies whether not people are wearing uniforms or helmets is going to impact how much fluid they lose et cetera. In a very hot environment that the amount of fluid lost can be anywhere from you know one to five maybe even ten pounds easy per hour hard hard exertion. For most exercise done in conditions of 55 degrees Fahrenheit to seven to excuse me 85 degrees Fahrenheit done with some degree of effort. One might lose a pound or or two pounds of water super easy way to find out all you have to do is weigh yourself naked. Go do your workout come back in dry off wear something naked that'll tell you exactly what you lost so if you went in you were 160 pounds you come back out you wait you want to 58 you lost two pounds drink back to and a half pounds water. You good so that is a it honestly is like fairly gold standard. And then you can actually buy a whole bunch of technology for this and they are using the exact same equation which is your body weight. When you were there now if you do that though you do need to account for any fluid you drink during the workout because that then offsets it. I think it's important question we're talking about a half an ounce of fluid per pound of body weight does that include things like coffee tea soda pre workout drinks mid workout drinks. Mont de macho whatever the you know there's a year but Mont de there's a million things out there or just water. Any fluid for the most part is going to count. And is it true that fluids that contain caffeine. Generally causes to secret sodium. Yeah. Okay so do you recommend including electrolyte powder or a small pinch of sodium or any number of other supplement type. Electrolytes that can replace that sodium magnesium and potassium. A couple of things we have to pay attention to to accurately answer that question. Well you also sort of asked about you may have not realized is caffeine actually enhance dehydration. Which is not really what you ask but it's probably a lot of people thought that as well. So caffeine can. But coffee doesn't necessarily do that because remember you're co ingesting that with fluid and so we used to say that all the time I'll coffee dehydrate to it doesn't have might make your urine yellow. That certainly gives off an odor in your urine. But in general coffee will not do that because your doesn't say if you were to now be taking caffeine pills alone. Now there is a bit of a diuronic effect there and so you're going to urinate how much. Maybe not enough for you to be really concerned with especially when you balance that against the urgogenic effects and benefits of caffeine. It's not something we are concerned about. Second of all your question. Do you need to then offset the loss. I'm not super concerned about the amount of sodium loss to caffeine. I am more concerned about simply the amount of sodium being correct because of the bigger circumstances like how much is actually in your system and how much you lost in the training session. So it's not the caffeine that I care about that much relative to you know if you lost three grams of sodium because of the training. And you had another few milligrams because the caffeine I don't really care or didn't. I'm glad you brought up the difference between a substance like caffeine and the vehicle it's contained in coffee. This is all really important and it also raises a question by individual differences in sweating ability and I call it sweating ability because I have a good friend of known for ages really. I actually work with them in my laboratory as well and he's one of these people that the moment he starts any physical activity. It's like a flood warning right he just soaks through clothing is just the sweating adaptation is is exceedingly robust in him other people less so so is it true that sweating and our ability to dump heat through it by loss of water is something that. We tend to vary on and that also that we can build up that capacity I know a number of people are probably thinking it will grow is why would I want to sweat more. There's actually a huge advantage to be able to dump body heat during exertion because body heat in some ways sets the cap for performance and many many ways including mental performance or ability to stay alert often is enhanced by being cold and of course we all want to warm up properly but. In terms of loss of fluid through sweating is there a way to easily been ourselves into kind of a low sweater medium sweater heavy sweater. It sounds like an article of clothing but in any case you know what I'm you know man another a lot to say here we should we had a whole series on this. If we have to go 17 hours we can do it just everybody hydrate well. I think we've shown the listeners that is a real threat that's a very real threat podcasting to failure you don't do every set in the gym to failure but here we are to be no podcast failure in it in all seriousness. What is the role of. Sweating ability and is this something that any of us should care about or train for or pay attention to or is this just kind of getting into the arcane. Number one you can train your ability to sweat this is important for heat acclamation and why that matters when you sweat that actually is not what regulates your temperature. What that happened is the fluid to hit your skin and that to be evaporated that's the actual mechanism so in fact. If you stop sweating and like you can guarantee within a short amount of time you're going to be done moving. Very interesting I hope people heard that and really are highlighting that in their mind that sweating as a process of bringing fluid. You're going to be able to do that in your body onto the surface of your skin and then the heat dumping aspect of sweating is the evaporation of that off of your body which brings to mind all sorts of ideas about how to dress during exercise etc. But what you said is that if you are not sweating enough you're limiting your output capacity so it's not just about having enough fluid to sweat. It's also about being able to sweat and being. You're going to have to appropriately to allow that sweat to move to evaporate off your body. Yep and heat acclamation training is as simple as the sounds so just practice it more so if you're going into a process where you either need to be in a hot environment or you need to improve your sweat rate. You just need to practice sweating and your body will get better practice the sauna practice as a juicy just get in those things and you will improve your ability to do that now. It's genetic component. I have one individual actually a UFC fighter I've been working with. I don't mind mentioning his name he'll give me full permission. Scott Holtzman. Many, many years. He's actually fighting right now actually today he'll be going he is like he he is like you described like buckets and buckets of fluids come off this guy when he's tying issues and he just goes right like. And now we've we've improved that I actually sweat too much we worked on that a lot early in his career and we got some improvements down to get him to hold on to the fluids better. That being said I've worked with other individuals in his weight category and it's the opposite right so we can have them literally do the exact same training session together and Scott will dump six pounds and other folks at his size will dump two to an hour. So there's a genetic component that is there and you don't need to worry about it there. So can you identify if you are a heavy salt sweater or not? Well you have a whole bunch of routes for this number one is you can use the old free cost free test of just looking at your clothing and if you're seeing that white residue all over it. So you all have the friend who probably wears that same best baseball hat that they've had for eight years. If it is covered in the white junk all over the place that's a sign of a higher salt sweater if the opposite happens and it's like you can pull their clothing back and there's just nothing there and they are maybe a little bit of a lower salt sweater you can also use any number of hydration tests. I know that there is some coming out in the market very very soon that can give you theoretically real time measurements is like a CGM would be although I haven't seen any data on if those are accurate or not haven't used one yet. But there are a number that are all super cheap 10 15 20 blocks all the up to a couple hundred dollars. You can buy these patches put them on you can get a reasonably close estimate and again if those things are five or ten or twenty percent off I don't know. I have to see independent data come out first but even if they are you're not worried about the specific milligrams right whether you sweat out you know 1250 milligrams and work out or if it's 1340. It doesn't really matter you're trying to look for big big numbers right are you losing 500 milligrams using three and a half grams. Well you're asking those things will get you in a ballpark to do exactly what you decide am I high medium or low and there's a lot of them that that I've used in the past so. That that's another way to go about it then what you want to do is probably match your electrolyte intake to something close to what you sweat that's the ideal scenario. You can get a lot of information about hydration from blood you can look at like a cute markers of dehydration like him a global and her madacrit if you're like if you're him a global and it's like 15 plus. It's funny we've talked about this in a few episodes before but I see that on my command that do super fit that's like a 15. For him we'll go with a pretty high 14 or so would be pretty good for a female that's also the exact same thing is the sign of a Q dehydration. So I'm out of criticism thing if you're north of 50% you're probably dehydrated so you can get a lot. There are also though a lot of biomarkers that can tell you more about chronic dehydration so you can run through those things as well so good blood chemistry test can tell you a lot and you can actually get some insights of your sodium and potassium. And it's another fantastic way to measure longer term hydration status now one of these amazing globulins that we've sort of talked a lot about. So you can do all those things you can also simply measure the body weight preimposed and use a sweat patch or not and use the that for your version of your clothing test and get a rough idea of where you're getting it from so. Those are good places to start. I want to go back though and make sure I wasn't over terrifying the audience too much on us so I'm a piece if you're performing a type of training or exercise or sport and which you're not losing more than 2% of your body weight you don't need to be overly concerned about hydrating in the sport. And so we can actually get into some equations for how much water to drink during training right now but if you if you're again losing less than that it's not critical you can have some fluids it like makes you feel better but you're not going to be experiencing tremendous amounts of performance segments if you're you know again outplaying a baseball game and it's 50 degrees out. You're fine I'm going to drink some water but that's not going to be compromising performance or recovery so. We can actually then if you'd like I can go through the three step system for optimizing hydration but those are I want to make sure I plan that flag so people are just terrified that they got to be buzzing down water. If they're you know going to the physical therapist for some stretching that's probably not super important. I'd like to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens athletic greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic and adaptogen drink. Designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic greens daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that their sponsor of this podcast. Reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me meet all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it covers my vitamins my minerals and the probiotics are especially important to me athletic greens also contains adaptogens which are critical for recovering from stress from exercise from work or just general life. I'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greens dot com slash human to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs and they'll give you your supply of vitamin D3K to again if you'd like to try athletic greens go to athletic greens dot com slash human to claim the special offer. I would love for you to tell us what I refer to as the galpine equation. Understanding of course that you did not name it the galpine equation listen folks scientists can have things named after them but in general it's not reflective of health e-cycology if they name things after themselves. Correct sometimes yes neuroanatomists used to do that but in any case doctor and a galpine did not name the galpine equation after himself I named it after him and the galpine equation for how much fluid to ingest during exercise is. You want to take your body weight in pounds and divide that by 30 and you want to consume that number which would be an ounces about every 15 to 20 minutes so in the example of you being 200 pounds you would take 200 divided by 30 which is let's just call that number 7 to be close which means you would consume about seven ounces of water every 15 or 20 minutes or so. Now as a little bit of a point while I also do not name it I also didn't do the research it's important to point out that other scientists figured these things out I just read their papers and made that derivation of their equation to make it a little bit easier for us folks who do not work on the metric system. Okay a couple of things first of all I'm not 200 pounds but it doesn't matter how much I weigh because the point is that the listener. Correct should take their body weight in pounds divided by 30 and just that number of ounces in fluid every 15 minutes and then for those out there outside the US that are accustomed to thinking in. Millileters and leaders not ounces and kilograms not pounds. What is the galpone equation in the metric system this would be two milliliters per kilogram. Which again if you were let's say 200 pounds that's going to be something roughly like we'll call it 90 kilos. And so if you did two milliliters per kilo you'd be something like 180 milliliters of fluid again every 15 or 20 minutes. Great and how should people ingest that fluid and of course I would imagine that it's through their mouth. I hope there are other orifices that might survive but let's not go there. They're drinking that water consistently or is it every 15 minutes they slug it back does it matter. Okay yeah that's very good handful of things. In general when you talk hydration the slower in study you can go the better in fact the reason these two milliliters per kilogram. Number came out is because a number of trials were run when they looked at that every 15 minutes just one boldness of it you know. In different durations and it's pretty clear that the slower pace one could do it the better so whether you're doing it every 10 minutes or 15 or 20 minutes the reason we actually give that gap is because you have to be also offset a little bit of GI distress. In fact like kind of the the four golden rules of recovery if you will. We used sort of three hours you need to rebuild rehydrate and replenish what that really means is you need to have a continuous glucose stream. You need to have a continuous amino acid stream. You need to hydrate and you need to do all one two and three without disturbing you got too much. And so in this particular case it was sort of found that we can hit that level in general and be just fine for most people so I mean a little bit of context the example we gave there in both cases it's something like six to seven ounces for 15 or 20 minutes if you think about that there are 16 ounces in a pound. And most water bottles like if you go by water bottle a store here it's the generally come in like 16 ounce bottles if so six or seven ounces is really like a third of a water bottle maybe. Every 15 or 20 or so minutes so it's not some egregious amount of water that you have to sign now that is influenced heavily by how hydrated you started the session with so how hydrated you came in. External factors like heat humidity temperature things like that but that gives you a rough idea that again and these are numbers that you would need to consume to optimize performance. At the end of that then is when you would look to see how much I lost like we talked about earlier and then add back that 125% taking into account how much fluid you ingested so if you're 200 pounds and you drink a total of say a pound of water during the training and you started off at 200 and you finished at 198. You actually lost three pounds not two pounds because you lost three you drank one during it so your final net number is two so now you don't you really need to drink back 125% of that remaining two pounds. Two and a half pounds something like that these numbers especially that 125 are they're just rough guidelines some actually papers suggest it's all the up to 150%. So it's just like an idea don't measure out whether you need 5.5 ounces or 6.2 ounces like it just sort of gives you an idea of where to start. A few steps every 15 or 20 minutes is close enough. I've actually started using the galpone equation to determine how much fluid I need for mental work. Given the now robust data that are out there on the relationship between hydration and mental work it's been very effective for me and again there are peer reviewed studies that support the idea that hydration is important for. We're a proper mental clarity and energy and focus and that even being slightly dehydrated can disrupt that but. If one is drinking so much water that they're frequently going to the restroom and can't comfortably focus on the work they're doing that's also an issue so. That's very helpful. What are the three most critical features of hydration and then I'd like to move on to some of the more particulars about supplementation and nutrition. Three parts start hydrated maintain hydration throughout part three is hydrate post to fix it okay we gave you the half ounce per pound of bodyweight equation so you start the training hydrated we gave you the. You know two milliliters per kilogram slash bodyweight divided by 30. To stay hydrated and we give you the one twenty five percent but I can actually just give you sort of I'm giving you another list here I'm sorry but it is my five step cheater guide. For optimizing hydration for performance sorry step number one drink a lot of water first thing in the morning. This gets everything kickstarted it's going it also saves you from having a drink a bunch of water at night which is then going to compromise your sleep what's a lot. Depending on how big you are the general thing I'll tell people is like one of the very first things you should do throughout your day you wake up go to the bathroom. As you're consuming your sunlight consume water this is maybe tugging a full glass it's honestly what I do it's not the best route but I'll just give you a. 16 ounces or so is great it's fine if you're larger you know I'm 165 to 70 pounds depending on what's going on maybe a little higher sometimes if you're 200 25 pounds maybe that numbers 30 ounces. All right so you need to sort of scale up and down and the reason I say a lot is it just depends on on what you're doing. And I also should clarify I don't really literally mean chug just like sip because the faster you drink water the faster it's going to expand blood volume the faster it extends blood volume the faster you get rid of it. I don't think a lot people will know that yeah this is maybe this is clarifying this is also we sort of talked about earlier if you drink too much water you'll dilute the system well if you have a diluted system your body's first reaction. Is to rid of water to bring total blood volume down right remember if you were to go to a doctor. And they look to your total blood volume they're like man you're five and a half liters you're going to be like holy crap you're going to be put on a diuretic because you don't want to have a heart attack and a blood pressure. I wonder if people are drinking a 16 ounce glass of water or other fluid. All at once before going to sleep and that's why they're waking up in the middle of the night total like given what you just said probably a better. Protocol would be to sip on a glass of water in the final hour two hours before sleep generally the number we say is three hours in the three hours preceding sleep you want to basically. Limit fluid intake to sipping as needed I think that's I'm going to start that tonight because I wake up generally once per night use bathroom and I do drink some fluids before I go to sleep because I'm pretty thirsty at that time. But I'm going to start sipping that water in the three hours heading into sleep. Yeah, so you can actually pay attention to is. To go back this is actually I love doing this stuff, but if you're waking up at night and you have a very dry mouth. All right, because it can be one of two things you might actually be dehydrated and so then the most sick people make is like man my mouth is so dry I keep getting up to drink water at night that makes you then pitch too much. What that also indicates is probably your mouth breathing. So a lot of ways to fix people waking up and you're dating too much a night is to tape your mouth and or use a a dilator over your nose. And then what happens is you don't feel like you have a dry mouth you can get up to consume any extra water throughout the night so that actually reduces your your fluid intake so you don't have the problem of actually now having too much fluid to do it. And so there's another reason why mouth taping can really really help. If you are having those issues and or snoring those are not benign that's a really like you really should get some work on those something you're not sleeping very well is the way I'll say it's it doesn't doesn't necessarily mean something in life threatening but it's not a good thing so. You're going to run kind of your triaging things back and forth so if you're like I'm waking up to pee a lot by my mouth isn't thirsty. Okay great then you may actually have just a water consumption issue if it is my mouth is dry but I'm actually waking up and having these large urination's then you're not actually dehydrated you're just breathing through your mouth. If you're waking up and your mouth is dry and there's not a lot of pee there then you actually might actually legitimately be under hydrated so a little bit of a game you can play there. It's super informative I think that the point alone that gulping a bunch of water all at once is going too cause you to need to excrete that water soon after is a really important point also for people that are going to give a talk. Or you don't want to have to get up to use the restroom you have to sit through a long meeting clearly I'm violating all these rules up until right now I've been you know not I sort of follow the sea goal approach to consuming fluids just in enormous volumes I'm going to start sipping. Fluids instead what are some of the other rules of hydration so you're going to wake up you to start your day and start hydrated so you're consuming a larger percentage of your water earlier in the day then you get all the performance enhancing effects of water. And you don't have to worry about compromising your sleep so that's step number one also now you're going to start your session closer to hydration all right great number two eat mostly real whole foods. Why interesting what you may or not have thought about is a huge determinant of your hydration status is your food choices. If you look at different foods for example most fruit water melon watermelon is like 95 plus percent water fantastic source also by the way since we're here it is not extremely high in carbide right it's not extremely sugar it is by percentage but it says is almost exclusively water your eating. It is not something that is extremely dangerous in terms of sugar. I their loan probably all the things we've talked about in the six six episodes that comment right there will probably. I'm moving to the point is that sugar is necessarily bad I think the point is that for most people they're ingesting too much sugar most people. And it's interesting often times that people who are justifying the ingestion of sugar exactly the kind of people that should not ingest so much sugar. So there's a little bit of a well user bias. The point here is if you're eating whole real food this is like now we're kind of splitting hairs about this thing so. So morning hydration. Yeah now important point here if you compare to other foods like actually me is is a very high percentage of fluid depending on how well or long you've cooked it you'll remember you said earlier. Or 70% water right so if you're eating meat you're getting actually a big chunk of water as you cook it of course you lose some of that but meat can be like. I wouldn't call it a hydrating food item but it is not as low as something like a biscuit which can be actually like 10% water. That's why it's like dry and dense which doesn't mean it's bad for you but there if you're eating highly processed foods almost by association that means they've been dehydrated. Or partially right so you're just getting less total fluid intake in addition they have also been highly salted. In general right so now we're in this position where we're under hydrated and highly salted. Bad spot if you now switch over to mostly and get just mostly whole real food ish whatever that means to you. Then your hydration is going to skyrocket you're going to have a lot so you're eating a ton of food in fact it should be a large percentage of the fluid intake you have actually should be coming from your food and you shouldn't have to be smashing water bottles. Water bottles after water bottle all day in that case though you do need to add salt back so we do see this a lot. When people try to make a transition from maybe a sub optimal nutritional lifestyle and I give up a little bit other process food and they come over and they start having problems because they're not actually consuming enough salt. So at that back easy way to do that you can use electrolytes when we could talk about those numbers if you want if you just salt your food that you're making. You know to taste that's going to get most people in a pretty good spot so start hydrated consume hydrating foods. Step number two step number three you want to pre hydrate if you know you're going to do a workout session and it's going to be hot and long or one of those things. You want to look for that half. A pound. A per body weight of ounces so that's the number we're looking forward to start our hydration session. We do that we're pretty much staying care and then I guess I adjust depending on lifestyle humidity and other factors like that. You can use what is called the what system W U T. I think Bob kind of thick has done a ton of research in this year if you want to read more look up his research. It is simply wait urine and thirst so in other words check your body weight. Look at your urine color and gauge your thirst and actually you can use those three things and those can significantly predict actual hydration status independent of actually measuring osmolider as anything like that. So those three metrics alone are pretty good indicator of where you're at. So you're going to have that no moment of water plus or minus. If you miss that number for whatever reason you get distracted the number we typically tell people is like something like 400 to 500 milliliters of water in the hour proceeding the training. All right, so that's like 13 to 20 ounces. So like you know you're going to go workout at three o'clock it's two o'clock and you realize, oh man I have not drink much water today. You don't need to go smash tons and tons and tons just look for something like that you know call it a bottle of water if you will. If that's not enough if you're in a really tough spot you can do more like five to eight ounces. Fifteen or twenty minutes before exercise. You want to be really careful about drinking a bunch of water like in the seconds before exercise. You're just going to feel a whole bunch of water bouncing up and down in your stomach and nobody likes that so one to 300 milliliters. Fifteen or so twenty minutes before that assumes you're in this like. Hundred and eighty five pound range. Yeah, so again if you're talking people of much larger size you may need to increase those values accordingly. If you do all that. Then you use the galp on a cohesion for your intro workout. Hydration and you're in a pretty good spot. What you want to consume in that is what I call sweat. What I mean by that is you don't actually want to necessarily consume water. Homey during a workout. You want to consume something that is isolismotic to your blood. So something that is the same concentration that you've lost in your sweat. So if you've done a sweat test you would then drink a fluid that is of the same as the. The short version of that. Something in the neighborhood of 200 to 400 milligrams of sodium. Most electrolytes products are going to be something like that. Now I know element is is a thousand milligrams and it's a lot higher. But most products now that you're going to find our 250 to 400 milligrams. And they're typically in the like two. To maybe have to three to one sodium to potassium range. Right coconut water is actually cool. It's like basically opposite. Like a cup of coconut water. It can have something like 200 milligrams of sodium. But like 600 milligrams of potassium. So like total spoiler alert. But what we use coconut water. A lot of hydration just add a little pinch of salt. Because I don't bring the sodium way back up. Yeah one note about sodium. Obviously people who have pre hypertension or hypertension want to be careful with their sodium intake. Um, the time I've suggested that people might consider ingesting more sodium. You know, it's sort of like, it's like putting a target on your on your back. And yet the data are pretty good showing that if people are not getting enough sodium. Their mental clarity, their focus, their mental stamina, their physical stamina really suffers. And then people argue well most of us are getting too much salt. That often is true for people that are eating a lot of processed foods and not training and not training. But for many people who are already sort of health conscious who are training. They're largely consuming or I should say they're consuming largely non processed or minimally processed foods. And especially for folks who are not ingesting many carbohydrates. And are consuming caffeine. You know, a lot of people don't know that carbohydrates hold water. And that makes it sound bad. It's not necessarily that you know, you're going to get subcutaneous swelling of your body. It's recovery. It's bringing water into your system and it holds water. So when you drop carbohydrates, starches in particular, you urinate a lot more. And when you drink caffeine, you also urinate a lot more as you pointed out earlier. So you start combining a few things like slightly lower carbohydrate or low carbohydrate, eating really quote unquote clean. You're not getting a lot of salt in your food. And drinking caffeine and then exercising. And then pretty soon those numbers that come along with, you know, a gram of sodium in your body. And then some of sodium in your electrolyte drink are not all that outrageous. And what you find is people feel much, much better when they're getting enough sodium. And of course, I should say that there's no reason why someone has to ingest a supplement like element or something. There are plenty of other ways to bring sodium into your system. You use a pinch of pink salt or himaland salt or sea salt or even just table salt in water. Or just making sure that you're salting your food enough. And I think that there to salt appetite and salt tastes is a pretty good guide. If you taste something and it tastes really salty to you, that's an indication that either it's really salty or your salt stores are kind of tapped off. You're okay. Whereas if you're craving salt and you're thinking, gosh, I really want to put salt on this already salty thing. Not necessarily, but oftentimes that means that you are salt deficient. So salt appetite is a pretty hard-wired set of neural circuits and hormones. And I think we would all be wise to learn to tap into the kind of intuition about salt intake. But of course, also to measure your blood pressure, et cetera. Yeah, of course. If you think you have some sort of congenication there that work with the medical specialists without question, those situations you laid out that were very, really. A lot of people are living like that. And so it's important for those folks to understand if you are going through symptoms fatigue, lack of focus cognitive function, performances in there, then hey, like you may be under salted. And again, actually a good amount of blood chemistry work can unravel that a lot. And it can sort of tell you if you're going to add a whack. There are a number of folks who are extremely sensitive to sodium in terms of health risk. And that is a real thing. Again, work with your individual folks on that. I don't work with anyone for a disease treatment or management at all. I've said that probably four times. I'll say it six more times. I only take people who are healthy and trying to make them perform at their best possible level. So it's actually funny to mention that because I was going to give people my recommendation for sodium intake in general throughout the day. And then I decided I'm not going to say that because all it's going to do is make all the rest of the people who aren't coming to come after me for the watermelon comment. Come after me for that. So all the end of the day is episode the goal is that everyone's coming after you, but also everyone has learned something of value. You've already given us tremendous insights and actionable information on creatine and hydration. And along those lines, I'd love for you to tell us about some of the things that we can do with supplementation in order to enhance training by taking certain things before we train. And I also have the question of how long before training should we start thinking about supplying nutrients and supplements for the training session. I'm not sure if I actually finished my fiber maybe I wasn't clear enough about the last one. So I just want to tie that bow and then we'll go on. Yeah, no, it was probably my fault. So that in addition to the galpon equation in terms of amount, I recommend I recommend it roughly three to one. Sodium to potassium recommendation and I gave you some rough numbers things to look at. I actually in all honesty use probably six to ten different electrolyte companies depending on the situation. Some of them are really good. In the case again, like element that's nice about that is there's no carbohydrate. However, the downside is there's no carbohydrate. So sometimes I want carbohydrates in the training because as you mentioned, there's significant evidence going back actually several decades on the benefit of carbohydrate during exercise. So if you're in a situation where you're trying to again maximize actual exercise performance, you, especially if it is either a long duration, so more than two hours or extremely high intensity. And this has to be well north of 100% of your go to max. And that situation as we talked about in the endurance episode, you can actually start having a decrement and performance because of a drop of muscle glycogen. Glibrillic glycogen can start coming down. If that's the case augmenting with carbohydrates during the training, then it's going to enhance performance. It's going to do what we call spare the liver and it's going to keep my second rule of my four, which is maintain glucose and justion. It's going to keep that going. In general, what you're going to find is the number is like a five to nine percent glucose concentration in your fluid, which turns out to be like exactly the number that most sports drinks have as well as I think that's pretty much exactly what coconut water is. The downside of sports drinks since we're here is they actually tend to be under salted. And so that they don't provide enough of them. If you look at the numbers, you're going to say something like 60 to 100 grams of carbohydrate per hour. Is the target. And now if you're using the sort of gallop integration and you're splitting that up into 15 minute intervals, it's something again like 20 or so grams of carbs per 15 to 20 minutes. If you're doing again an hour long plus training about so admittedly 100 grams is a bit much for some folks depending on your size. So I would recommend starting in that 60 gram or so range again per hour total is what you want to get to. Only in the situation which muscle glycogen depletion is becoming a limiting factor to performance. So the other benefit of that is as you mentioned, that actually drives water into the cell. And so you're going to be in that nice sweet spot of you're actually keeping glucose going, which is going to enhance performance and you're helping hydration at the same time. So the other little part that's important to pay attention to here is the type of carbohydrate matters. So you can use actually a whole combination of things called resistance starches, which I will use for a long amounts of exercise, but in the middle of the workout. You're going to want to focus on glucose and fruit dose mostly glucose. Typically at least a two or three to one ratio of glucose to fruit dose. And the reason is those actually get into tissue through separate transporters. And so what happens is once the glucose transporters get full, you can't bring anything else in. However, since fruit dose comes in a separate route, you can maximize total carbohydrate intake by using two different unique forms. There's a lot of ways you can do this, but this is where the momentous fuel product is specifically has that exactly in it. So it's fantastic. You can use food, no problem. You can use the combination of things like honey and different easily absorbable and usable. And things that you can actually like maybe put in a drink to get away with. So there's lots of routes for it. But you want to look in that sort of combination of five to nine percent roughly glucose for there. So you do need to train your gut. So do not do anything. And there's a generally a good rule. Do not do anything in your competition that you've never done in practice. So try these food items, try these amounts, the carbohydrate numbers, try the sodium numbers, try the total amount of water. Start low. You can always increase. What you don't want to do is have to run out during the middle of your spin class and sprint to the bathroom, and hope nobody's in your way. Which in the lab we've seen. Well, just say accidents like that occur more than once. So just be careful of your stomach. I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker. Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera. But you don't know what to do with that information. Inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course. But then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can visit insidetracker.com slash human to get 20% off any of inside tracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com slash human to get 20% off. I realize that jump the gun a little bit asking about supplementation for before during and after a workout, because what I neglected to ask about was training in the fasted state. This is something that we talked about in an earlier episode, but I think it's worth highlighting now. Sometimes the best way to supplement if you will a workout or pre workout is ingesting nothing. I'm one of these people actually prefer to do my weight training somewhere between 7 and 8 a.m. Meach morning, sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little bit later. I drink fluid water and I do ingest caffeine prior to those training days. On days when I don't train, I do, as I often recommend people do, delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking. But in any event, it's water and caffeine, your bramate or coffee or some sort of stimulant for weight training workouts. And generally not for cardiovascular training workouts, although sometimes yes. So I'm training fasted that said, I'm ingesting carbohydrate the night before to make sure that my, I have glycogen stores that are opt off. And so it's fasted, but with that caveat, what are your thoughts on training fasted? And what I just described is fasted overnight, but some people are training in the afternoon, and they may opt to not eat anything in the, you know, two to four hours prior to training or maybe even longer. I personally find that caffeine hits my system a lot better when I'm fasted. Better meaning it just seems to have more of a potent effect. There are some reasons for that. And of course, we just swayed people from ingesting caffeine to late in the day because they'll disrupt sleep. So I'm not saying fast that for three hours, then drink caffeine, but who knows, maybe that's in your protocol. The simple version of this question is, what are your thoughts on training fasted? And if people are going to train fasted, how should they modulate their fluid intake, if it all? What happens with exercise in the endurance and metabolism episode, walk through in the fact that no matter what you're using for fuel, car behind rates or fat, or even other potential sources, the end product of all of those is ATP, CO2 and water. Right? So you're trying to make ATP, that is the fuel for exercise. Now ATP is a denysing tri-fast phase. So one, two, three phosphates on top of an denysing. Well, what you may have not put together is if you hydrolyze ATP, and you break off one of those phosphates, you not have ADP. If you do it again, you have a MP adenosine monophosphate. If you do it one more time, now you just have adenosine. And if you have then, therefore, run through a lot of exercise, burn a lot of energy, you have increased the amount of adenosine that's floating around. Now, if you have a high concentration of adenosine, what's that going to make you want to do? That's going to bind to certain receptors. And when we know when those receptors get bound to, you fall asleep. Bingo. Caffeine will competitively bind to those receptors. Therefore, that's why caffeine stops you from feeling like you want to go to sleep. Right? So we have a very clear relationship between exercise fuel. In fact, if you look at the literature, there's a pretty clear relationship between the more caloric expenditure in different sports, and the higher amount of hours needed for sleep. So, there is a nice tie between how hard you're exercising, how much energy you're burning, how much you need to sleep, stimulants, which brings us all the way back to your question of fueling. So, do I need a fuel prior to my exercise about, if you're going to be limited in your exercise about, by fuel, then fueling is necessary. One way or the other. If it is a type of training that is not, then it's not going to matter. And so, the examples we gave, if you're doing, if you're going to go do a 30 second about a maximum exertion, and you're going to do it one time, you don't need to worry about fueling at all. We're eating within your workout, because only 30 seconds. You don't need to worry about hydration, post-exercise, you don't need to worry about recovery. Total energy expenditure was nothing. If you're going to go, you know, you're going to go practice, you're going to go to the driving range and practice your golf swing. You don't need to worry about it. The total amount of energy expenditure is not high. In fact, in that case, you might want to keep it somewhat low, because you want to keep blood glucose fairly even, and you don't want to bring it into the system. You certainly wouldn't want to use stimulants. All right, because you may get over exerted inside. In all of these things, we probably should have started off our conversation with this. In terms of macro nutrients, the total amount throughout the day is more important generally than the timing. Of them, which is why you can do things like have a bunch of carbohydrate at night, not eat the next morning, and lift, and be just fine. It doesn't matter that you didn't have them in a few hours before. You're muscle glycogen is topped off. You're liver is glycogen is topped off. You're absolutely fine. You have plenty of time left. Even if you're a few more hours. In fact, even if you were to do conditioning, you're probably fine. I have plenty of athletes that prefer to do many other train sessions faster than morning for personal reasons, because it enhances performance, but if it doesn't enhance or harm it, then it's a personal preference thing. Fine. If you're going to go do a session, though, where you're going to be really concerned with muscle glycogen to patient, and again, you can go back that episode to learn different types when those thresholds hits and what you're worried about it. Then, if you're feeling would be important, you would either need to have something before the session or consume it during the session. So, one of the other things we'd like to say here is recovery starts during the previous workout. So, if you're working out right now and you optimize nutrition right now, even if you don't necessarily need it for the current workout, if you can get a head on recovery, then you're going to be fine the next day. And the differentiation here between carbohydrate and protein is important. So, the total amount of protein you ingest throughout the day is probably a bigger determinant for things like muscle growth than the timing. So, the post-stictor size animal like window, it doesn't necessarily matter. Carbohydrate is different. The timing of that does matter. It needs to be around the available. So, you can maximize both hydration and muscle glycogen resynthesis, which is restoring the muscle glycogen you burn during exercise. I also work with athletes that train multiple times a day. So, in those particular cases, recovery window is half, but you normally have. So, if you're in a situation where you have two or three days before you work out again, you don't need to worry about getting carbohydrate and before during our after. Because by the time you go to train again, you will have restored your muscle glycogen levels easily. However, if you're training every day or twice in a day, then the timing of carbohydrate really starts to matter. And in that case, I see no reason to not ingest those nutrients either before during our after. You don't need to necessarily do it, but you can. The general rule of thumb I give is something like this. If you're doing something where you're trying to really work hard, whether this is hypertrophy training or a lot of endurance, energy expenditure is going to be high, potential muscle damages high, and or energy utilization is high. What you want to look for is a number something in the area of like half a gram of carbohydrate per pound of body weight. So, you weigh 200 pounds. You want to make sure that either pre mid or post or total. You bring in a hundred grams of carbohydrate. It's just a very rough number to start. Protein is about half of that. So, it's about a quarter of your body weight. Right? So, those numbers would be if you're 200 pounds, make sure you have 100 grams of carbs and 50 grams of protein. And again, it doesn't necessarily have to be before or during our after. Indio being a good spot. All you need to do then is alter what I do I should say is alter the amount of carbohydrate based on energy expenditure. So, an lower energy and easier workout. Instead of having a hundred grams of carbs, I might attack that down to 75 or even 50. And be at a one to one carb protein ratio. If it was even harder, more sun, hotter outside, more fluid loss, I might go from 100 grams of carbs up to 150 or 200. A closer like a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 carbohydrate protein ratio. So, those are the numbers that I generally go by. Well, as I take a sip of my double espresso americano, here I'd love for you to tell us about stimulants. Sure, there's no shortage of these in most of our lives. And of course, you can cover the health benefits of it later. Maybe you have an episode. Yes, we have an episode on caffeine. And it does have certain health benefits, although one has to use caffeine correctly in order to drive. So, there's caffeine is the easy one to start with. And we won't believe we're the point here. The evidence is strong. It has an urgent effect. You can take it at whatever dosage is reasonable for you. And of course, there is a bit of a learning curve there. Such that obviously the more you take it, the more you need to take. Even though there's actually some recent evidence showing. Even folks who are acclimated to it, we'll still see an urgent benefit, even though if they don't feel a big boost of it. So, typically that takes 30 to 45 minutes or so, but it's highly dependent upon the person. So, some people can smell coffee and immediately feel better. And that's probably working actually through a different mechanism of anticipation. But you can take it there at the half life of it is, you know, four to six hours or something like that. It can totally depends on the person. So, don't let it run your sleep. But if you take it prior to performance, it has a noticeable effect on a particularly endurance. Maximum strength, maybe less, it will quite clearly less so. In fact, the data are mixed there on whether it actually does anything for peak strength. Although I think most people would, would suggest that, you know, you're going to take it prior to trying to truly lift as I was trying to, you know, lift a one-up tissue max or similar. But most of the, the documented effects are on the endurance-based activities. Yes, so my read of the literature in terms of performance enhancing effects of caffeine are that. One to three milligrams. I want to make sure that people hear the units correctly before you blitz themselves out of that. Caffeine one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight. About 30 minutes prior to exercise has a definite performance enhancing effect. It also has a definite mental performance enhancing effect. Especially when people who are regular caffeine users have abstained from caffeine for anywhere from two to 15 days. And that's an extremely rare circumstance. But even if they have not, it appears that one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight of caffeine. Taking about, I can't say that super precise as far as I can see, about 30 minutes before the event starts. Can really enhance reaction time and power output and, as well as, as you mentioned, endurance. When I was researching the caffeine episode, one interesting caveat that I discovered was that if people are not caffeine adapted, they are not regular users of caffeine. The sudden introduction of caffeine can really degrade performance, mostly because people don't know how to operate at that high level of autonomic arousal. Yeah, 100% in fact, there's actually data going up as high as 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Wow. Which is in fact, once you cross the five milligrams per kilogram threshold, you will start seeing performance decrements. So there's absolutely such a thing of ruining your performance with too much caffeine. So most people listening to this if you're thinking, wow, they said caffeine, I'm all in and then you just stop listening. And now you go for your quad espresso shot before your every time you go to workout. You're probably passing that threshold. If you think about those numbers, one to three milligrams per kilogram body weight, if you weigh 100 kilograms, that's 220 pounds. That'd be something like two to 500 milligrams of caffeine, which is like a pretty high amount. But, you know, a coffee is going to get you close and espresso is going to get you somewhat in that ballpark, depending on source of stuff. So you don't really need to go and blister your brain with caffeine. And in fact, if you do, it's quite common. And in fact, likely that you'll actually make performance worse. Right. Yeah, the amount of caffeine in different coffees and sodas, etc. Of course, varies. One thing that people ought to know is that the smallest of commercially available coffees at the most popular commercial vendors. Generally contain anywhere from 250 to 350 milligrams of caffeine. What that means is that the so called medium and the large contain as much as 500 milligrams or one gram of caffeine. So for you morning, large coffee at commercial vendor, drinkers, if you're wondering why you get a headache if you're 30 minutes late on that caffeine or If you can't access that caffeine at all or even if you're drinking cap coffee, excuse me, from another source. And you're finding like, well, it's really not doing it for me. It's because the amount of caffeine in the now commercially sold coffees is exceedingly high. It's about two or three times higher than the standard lookup tables that you'll see on the internet. So I'm not saying that to demonize caffeine. We can pretty quickly adapt to inform a tolerance to caffeine. Some people never really can get over the jitters. Other people are just fine with even a thousand milligrams of caffeine, but only because they've been drinking a lot of caffeine consistently anyway. It's also wildly inconsistent from location, location, the brew type, the functionality. So yeah, that stuff can be very hard to figure out what's happening. There's only one way really to objectively measure caffeine and that's use caffeine tablets. And they work pretty well. Actually, someone I know who's prominent in the podcast space uses 100 to 200 milligrams of caffeine in tablet form combined with tea. So they've now conditioned themselves to think that herbal tea actually has this caffeinating effect, but tablet form caffeine while I'm not recommending it to outright. It is going to give you the best sense of how much caffeine you can tolerate and how much is performance enhancing or is performance degrading. There's actually another line of supplementation that we can go down here, which is not technically as dimulant, but it's something I use to help performance when you don't want caffeine. And so this is things specifically if you're one of those folks who have to exercise at night and you want a little bit of boost for your training, but you don't want to have caffeine because it messes up your sleep. And this is when you can turn to the whole like citrillion, arginine nitric oxide sort of route and we'll skip the explanation there, but effectively what happens is nitric oxide is this wonderful compound that causes vasodilation. And of course, that's going to aid then in transporting nutrients in and out of the cell. So it has an urgianic effect. You have a number of ways you can go about this. Some of them have more pros and cons than others and there are more more data coming out specifically on citrillion, more recently. If you look though, in my opinion, the most consistent evidence for the most consistent effect is in the supplement of beetroot or beetroot juice or extract or something like that. So you can find those supplements and they tend to again, the pretty effective and enhancing performance specifically anything moderate to longer duration endurance performance and they are not a stimulant so they won't ruin your sleep that much. One note of caution for those of you that are interested in citrillion or beetroot because they are in the arginine pathway. If you're somebody who has a predisposition to cold source. Oral cold source that is or other forms of cold source that because activation of the arginine pathway can exacerbate some of the neural related aspects of cold source. And that's because the virus is that cause those cold source actually live on neurons. Then you want to be very cautious with citrillion, especially high dose citrillion. I can really amplify that the cold source response. What about non-stimulant yet focus enhancing supplements, things like alpha GPC. For example, I routinely use 300 to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC prior to hard physical training typically weight training. But occasionally I'll take 300 milligrams of alpha GPC prior to a mental workbout. Less often these days cause I kind of reserve it for physical training and I don't tend to use it every day. Maybe once every third or fourth workout combined with caffeine. So that combination is pretty pretty potent. I find. And so technically because it's a colonurgic agonist. It's not a stimulant in the traditional sense. But it has a focusing and an alertness promoting aspect to it. What are your thoughts on those sorts of compounds? There's not much human exercise performance data on those. There are certainly cognitive functioning tests on those. So you're not going to find a lot of information. No, though there isn't none. We actually will use many of these substances you could globally call them neutropics, which is any substance that specifically only has brain function is a rough way to think about it. We'll use them prior to more challenging bouts of training. This is something that will pull out say on the sparring day only. Or the most important training session or session when you're trying to work on pitch command or when you're trying to enhance work on your shot. And as a basketball player or you're really trying to improve a certain swing is a golfer or something like that. But we do not use them every day. We do not use them every person. So yeah, we will use those. They're not stimulants, but they can be performance enhancing. And another kind of way to think about this is if you're in the case of caloric restriction. So whether you're trying to lose weight or we're actually trying to control weight for weight purposes in terms of a sports where you have to be in a certain weight class or something like that. Well, we may not be able to give you food. In fact, we may not be able to give you stimulants because of the sleep thing or because we're already like max on us. Now we can go this route. And so you least like mentally you're a little bit there and you're more likely to be a lurch and focused and you can train harder despite the fact that we didn't actually change fuel. Now that's a little bit of a short game in terms of that's not your permanent solution. You eventually need to bring calories up or whatever other training or whatever are going to do. But it can work in a nice short pinch. And it's very interesting to learn from you about fatigue reducers. And I'm hoping that rodeo la rosaia will come up in the conversation. Yeah, great. Let's just start right there. Then there's actually a lot of research on this despite most people not having heard of it. I think I mentioned in a previous episode. I've used it a lot over many, many years. You have to be a little bit careful of it. There's, well, first of all, no, we should have said this at the onset. No supplement is a panacea. Right, nothing's going to work for everything. And rodeo is no different. It can have a number of effects. And if you look across the literature, you're going to find generally somewhere between a small benefit to a little benefit. But not often is it detrimental with a few exceptions. I know of a handful of papers that would be too specifically where it may actually reduce muscular endurance. Okay, fine. If you think about what's happening is one of the benefits that has been seen so far with rodeo la is helpful at managing cortisol. But cortisol suppression is not necessarily a good thing. We talked about how if you do an acute about a stress cortisol will go away up. And that is a sign of acute stress. However, a sign of long term excessive stress is cortisol suppression. And so this is a thing to be really careful of, you see if you're feeling down or lefthargic or tired and you think your adrenal is remessed up. And then you start taking cortisol modulators. You could be making the problem worse. Because now your cortisol is actually suppressed. And now you're taking these things to blunt it or keep it low. And you continue to feel lefthargic and lack of desire and libido and focus in this sort of all these things. So cortisol is not a bad thing. We want this to be going up and down in the amounts that we want. So if we're thinking about like, for example, waking up. You would want generally something like a 50% reduction in the first hour, in terms of cortisol concentrations. However, if you're extremely suppressed already going down is only going to be a problem. So rodeo la is is has a good evidence base to support it for that. You'll see actually a number of studies that have looked at it in a whole host of areas for benefits. So something good to do the difficult part with rodeo la to be quite honest is getting it from my high quality brand and source. It's difficult to get as a single source, which is a very, very important thing to do with supplements is try to get them sourced alone. rodeo la typically comes in combination with any other urbles or other stuff, adrenal support and such etc. That also then getting them then third party certified, which for most folks is not necessary, but for any athletes that need to go through drug testing systems, you should not take any supplement at all that does not have some sort of third party certification. So those are the challenges that being said, if you've ever ran it in somebody who's taken rodeo la and they're like, I didn't do anything for me. It's possible. That's, you know, nothing worse for everyone and also could be just very poor quality sourcing. So if you look at the there have been a number of papers on its perception of fatigue and we use sort of mentioned that you felt pretty immediate effects of taking a few times. Yeah, I'm fairly sensitive of supplements, but I've started taking rodeo la before workouts and found that I could push much harder, much longer through the workout. Normally I would it or typically before taking it. That is in sessions where I did not take it. I would be able to work out very hard for 20 minutes or so. Then next 10 minutes I could get some work output and then the remaining period of time it was kind of a tapering off. Now granted these are very intense training sessions. These are not the endurance training sessions. These are the weight training sessions at one one time per week, per body part type sessions. What I've noticed is I can complete the entire 60 minutes with with minimal fatigue now. I mean, obviously I get fatigues within sets and of course, you know, you remain human despite taking it, but I found to be very useful and I've been using it whenever I use alpha to PC prior to workouts. And I've been impressed by it overall. I do want to highlight something that you said because I think it's so, so vitally important, which is that using single ingredient formulations for most things is critical to figuring out what works for you, what doesn't, what dosages you need. Being able to take things to on one off two days on one day off, for instance, being able to increase dosage in the morning and then, maybe reduce the dosage and combine with something else in the afternoon. Single ingredient formulations are pretty much the only way to do that. There's perhaps only one supplement that I take at all, and that's athletic greens, as there have been a regular podcast sponsor for a long time, that is a cocktail of many, many things, and those are all adaptogens, as well as some probiotics and vitamins and things like that. So I'm not opposed to blends where the blends include a lot of nutrients that are synergistic, but for all pill capsule based supplements, where I'm looking for a very targeted effect, and it's not just about foundational nutrition. I think that's a really, really, really, really strongly that single ingredient formulations are the way that you can build a rational approach to supplementation, and also make adjustments if something isn't making you feel better, and also make adjustments is something really working for you. So for instance, some people might take it off a GPC 300 milligrams and not feel anything, go up to 600 milligrams, not feeling anything, maybe just feel kind of, they don't like it. Like myself, took 300 milligrams of alpha GPC the first time, it was like, wow, this really puts me in the zone, but I want to be really careful how often I use it. I did mention I go up to 600 milligrams occasionally, but that really puts me on the outer threshold of kind of overall levels of focus and amped up, such that if I drink too much caffeine, I can tilt me over the edge. So I encourage people to become scientists of themselves, and the only way to do that is to try and limit the number of variables. And the final point is that I think that single ingredient formulations are by far the best in terms of changing things over time. You know, this could be women during their menstrual cycle. It might find that during certain phases of the cycle, they're more sensitive to certain things than not others. And for men and women, it may be that you know, certain times of year or even, and certain supplements might go better closer to sleep some earlier in the day and on and on and on. There's just no real way in my opinion to have a supplementation protocol that involves lots and lots of blends. One or two blends okay, but lots of blends, I think that's actually think that's potentially dangerous territory. Yeah, I mean, just take Rodeola as a good example. I know a new meta analyses came out just in the last few months looking at it. And they found in general, you see again a slight to moderate improvement and everything from power output to fatigue resistant and a oxidant effects to endurance performance. So it's like, okay, great. I'll be there's a little bit here. Now let's say you went to do it in the only way you could access Rodeola is in combination with that and some lines main and you know some other. These adaptogens and it's like, well, wait a minute. I just wanted to take this to get a better workout, but now it also came with this stimulant or this cortisol suppressor or cortisol activator. Now also you can't take it at night or you can't take it in the morning because you're already you already had coffee your your options are just way limited. So I think the biggest part of all that if you if something doesn't feel good you have absolutely no idea. You don't know if it was Rodeola. You don't know if it was the bus well you know if it was any of the other things that were smashed in there or it could be something as simple as the. The the citric acid they use like some other combination of thing and now here you are thinking that some supplement that actually works for you doesn't and you throw that out of your repertoire. For the rest of your life, which is. You know, not the biggest crime, but it's not needed and you're not really going to know so yeah, I fully stamped you can look back at my course lectures for the last decade and you will see like stamped number one on the supplement lesections is make sure you're taking single ingredient supplements at all costs. The last part about that too is you're more likely to ensure the amount that is on the label is correct. So if you're taking Rodeola and it says, you know, it's 100 milligrams in there. And if that's only thing that's in there you're more likely than not to actually get something close now they're never perfect. But it will be close if it's in a combination of 20 other things you actually don't have any idea that's in there. In fact, there have been many papers on melatonin and vitamin D and a number of other supplements in which when you actually just pull them off the shelf. These are their standard studies where they would go and buy a set like 20 to 25 different supplements in the case of melatonin. And we'll actually measure the amount of melatonin actually in them and and despite the fact that the label says five milligrams they can be up to a 500 to a 1000 fold actual concentration in that supplement. And then you wonder why some people react great melatonin and some people that absolutely destroys you and this is also why like we'll actually we'll see this constantly. People will have like 500 times the upper limit of melatonin the morning after when the half life is supposed to be more like 90 minutes it should be totally gone. But we're seeing extremely not even talking like double I'm talking 10 to 20 30 x the upper limit range from melatonin the next morning. And then it's like well, what are you taking it's like oh I got this melatonin at x store or x website and you're like holy cow. So I'm not opposed to melatonin theoretically, but you have to be careful with that one every particular. So any supplement has that to be true. So you want to buy them from as many places that you can that are high quality and if they are third party tested even if you're not a performance athlete. I want to stress this even if you're not a performance athlete third party certified and test this up. Are your less likely to just get wildly high concentrations or low concentrations of active ingredients and so relative to other ones when you might get for cheaper. But you could be totally wrecking yourself by getting you know 50 milligrams of melatonin every night and not realizing it. And so then of course the next morning you drown yourself in caffeine and then you can see what death cycle you're in now. Yeah and people could look for third party certification on the packaging and some websites will allow you to zoom in on the bottle beforehand. It's largely listed on certain vendor websites. A brief point about supplement cost and blends and I promise this will be a brief point. Different ingredients, meaning different types of supplements have widely varying costs in order to you know create to get into the manufacturer them. So all of them you'll find is that blends will include the least amount of the most expensive ingredient right not always the case. There's some there certain exceptions to this and I mentioned some blends that I like a few minutes ago that are for foundational nutrition adaptogens and probiotics. Athletic greens of course just being one of several examples out there. But when it comes to say a sleep blend or a pre workout blend there are some decent products out there but a lot of them tend to put in more of the least expensive ingredients and less of the ones that you're actively seeking. And so those tend to be caffeine tends to be a kind of a buffer against the other things meaning if you pre workout that's putting caffeine in there isn't necessarily a bad thing. But if it has five other things in there oftentimes what manufacturers will cheat on is the actual amount of the things that are costly. So again singling ingredient formulations for 80% of your supplements. I think is really the way to go. And the other thing that I know is going to come up as we're talking about all these supplements is the issue of dependency. I often get this question and when I solicit for questions on social media and anticipation of this episode. Number of people said, okay so if you take a sleep formulation, do I need to take it every night if I don't take it will I have an incredibly hard time sleeping if I take a pre workout every time I train will. Well I need it. It's a great question. Some people will take supplement holidays as they may be called for a couple of days each week back to back. Some people take them straight through I myself take us asleep cocktail we've described this it's magnesium, the Indian and things. This is not one ingredient these are multiple ingredients in fact precisely because some people who have sleep walking and vivid dream issues can't take the Indian before bed. In any case I had times when I either forgot my supplements that's rare or I just didn't have what I needed or just simply took a break for a night and it was not a problem. But in terms of pre workout I do think that people become dependent on being in that really ramped up state. But I don't think we view all this as true dependency and addiction. I define addiction as a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. So I suppose people could get addicted to pre workout but it seems a little unlikely more likely there would be a dependency such that if you didn't have your pre workout, might feel like you're not motivated to train. So what are your thoughts on taking little holidays from supplements and varying frequency of supplement intake in particular as it relates to stimulants and fatigued reducers. The end goal any time I coach somebody is to get them into a physiological state in which they require no or close to no supplementation. That's the target. We should really be in a position to our lifestyle, our sunlight exposure, our stress management, our physical activity, our sleep and our hydration and our whole food nutrition provide us almost everything we need. Now look again there are some foundational items that we can give people. We put together a little bundle actually for this that basic things that you can go look at. But that's the goal right. So the target is to be let your physiology run the guy your physiology is way smarter than we are even if I take a bunch of biomarkers from you. Your physiology still knows better than those few markers can tell me. So that's always where we're ending up. I actually personally don't like people being in a position that they have to take a supplement for anything. So I don't like it if you have to take a supplement to have a good night asleep. I don't like it if you have to have a supplement to train. We will use any of these stimulants very very carefully with any of the athletes we work with and certainly put it on athletes because at least the athletes we have an end date. We have a fight schedule. We have a season we have a game you're going to pitch whatever. When you don't have that it's sort of like you're in this endless cycle of oh you're just going to do that all day every day. We don't really need to be in that spot. So what I the way that I describe my philosophy is I will use those short term tactics to symptom manage if I have to. So if somebody comes to me and they're like you're feeling awful and we've got to get through the hump. Okay great. Maybe we'll give you something for sleeping immediately to get you sleeping. That allows us to then come back and work on the causal problem right. What is why are you having a hard time sleeping anyways if you have to take a nine cocktail supplement to sleep. Then all we're doing is is blinding the reason why are you in that position to begin with right. So we see this all the time whether it is sleep problems whether it is cortisol or testosterone the question is why is that low. Now we may give you something again to manage it immediately but the task the mystery I'm going to try to unveil is why. Why is it there to begin with? This could be something like this is natural for you and your lack of energy is something else or could be actually it is not an natural level for you but something is suppressing it any number of. You've got some infection going on there's some allergic reaction to something in your environment there's a you know mold mercury like that one comes up a lot you'll see mercury in folks and that's causing a lot of problems or any number of heavy metals or toxins any host of things like logical distress bad daily habit you don't ever see the sun like. You don't ever sweat you don't ever drink lose talk about so many things so I'm always going to hunt. For that and I hate using this phrase it's highly maligned for a good reason but root cause. All right, so we're trying to find that is like are we making sure that we're not causing this problem and I'm not going to want to give you a supplement. To cover up something if we're not even trying to solve the problem of what's being there. That being said and my that concern about people taking a multi vitamin just all throughout not really and my concern about people taking creating no like go ahead. Those ones are generally pretty fine to just take but anything else I want a reason. I really don't like giving people anything in a super physiological concentration or a super food concentration right so again an amount you wouldn't find in a normal food dosage unless we have really specific reasons some of these things. are more problematic others are less problematic so when an answer to the question of dependency you have a combination of actual physiological dependency caffeine. Like that actually creates a physiological dependency versus a emotional or psychological dependency or just a I like drinking this like that's my habit that's my routine there's a fancy scientific phrase for that but it doesn't matter. So yeah we want to get off that and like again my personal philosophy is I don't want you to depend on anything I want to create extremely resilient people. And I want to create physiological resilience we actually have a fancy little algorithm we used to measure that in people. And so we can actually calculate that number and the goal of us is to push that number higher so that we don't have to have anything. So many situations pop up in your real life that you're not going to have your supplement or you're not going to have your routine or you're not going to have your journal or whatever. But also for the long term I don't want to create a situation in which this is a short term success that you have to now do that the rest of your life. Now let's just get out of the way let's fix the problem if there is something symptom management that's real. While we're actually searching for better foundational habits on the last thing I want to say about this is. If you're only covering symptom. You're really missing signal right which is if you're constantly tired throughout the day and all you're doing is giving yourself a number of alpha gpc's and caffeine's et cetera even though there's good little sugar. Are you really just using that to allow your porcelain hygiene to happen if they took those away I bet you. You would actually start addressing your sleep if that's the cause right or I your stress or your poor hydration like you would go hunting for the problem. And so like you want to walk a fine line here going like hey look is an athletic greens supplement that big of deal now probably not but. Wait a minute am I actually now covering up the pain point that is maybe needed it's a signal to actually get my ass and gear to go make one of these changes. Whatever it needs to be so I know I've had like a little bit meta on you a little bit so I've got that's honestly how I approach it. Yeah I think it's really important a friend of mine who's a physician has a great saying. Which is better living through chemistry still requires better living. But that's cool that that's so good. You know and it pertains also to things like antidepressants and ADHD drugs and things that sort most all of those things were developed as tools to allow people to move from a. Maladaptive state of Maladaptive is hard to define but think about in any domain of life you can either be back on your heels flatfooted or forward center of mass. And there are times when people are so compromised nor chemically that they need to use pharmacology in order to get into a flatfooted position. Yeah, they're really back on their heels flatfooted or forward center of mass but the idea is always that those things were developed as things to allow people to engage in the sorts of behaviors that can produce the same sorts of neurochemical shifts. And the people are thinking well what sorts of behaviors can induce these neurochemical shifts I'll just zoom out myself for a moment here and say I am a big proponent I believe you are as well if I may. In doing behavioral tools first whenever possible really establishing good habits the dues and don'ts she talked a lot about in this series and in this episode. And then excellent nutrition which involves dues and don't volume food choice timing all the factors and then also supplementation and also there sometimes a case for prescription drugs certainly and often brain machine interface or body machine interface measuring stuff using devices. But the foundation of behaviors and good nutrition are really truly foundational and it's hard and anything to skip steps but supplements and prescription drugs are one place where people often skip steps and then they don't actually learn how to cultivate the best behavioral practices including the don'ts as you mentioned and then just one more point along these lines. You know you talked about taking anything for energy is really disruptive to the system and it is because especially caffeine while it has its uses and even health benefits it's really borrowing. And then it's against the adenosine system within trust and so because caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist effectively while caffeine is present in those receptors. You don't feel asleep you have more energy your reaction time goes down memories and his focus performance of all kinds yes. But then when that caffeine is dislodged from the receptor then the adenosine can act even more importantly at those receptors so it's sort of like being able to borrow against the normal variations in wakefulness and sleep and this is why we encourage people. If they're not training first thing in the morning to push their caffeine and take out about 90 to 120 minutes after waking so they can clear some of that adenosine in the morning which tends to happen even. After we wake up. People can listen to episodes on master sleep or perfect sleep or the caffeine episodes to understand more about that but the final thing I just want to say here and then it prompts a question is you know in thinking about. Supplement protocols. I think a lot of people assume that once they start taking something they're going to have to take it all the time and one idea perhaps is that people have some. Alpha GPS around that they could take and granted be great if people could try things without having to buy a whole product I think companies hopefully you're listening to this and will. Give people a sample to see if something works for them and then give them an opportunity to try it to have things around but not necessarily assume you're going to take it every time right some things you take every day foundational nutrition. Supplements for instance, but then also to take a look at how well you're eating or not eating right at times when I'm eating much better. I think that it's a very good way of consuming you know low sugar fermented foods which are great for the gut microbiome I consume less probiotics if ever I've been really compromised for whatever reason then I will take pill form probiotics but I don't take those all the time. Because I get them from food and from certain you know greens drinks like athletic greens and so forth. So I think that nutrition and supplementation are are tethered in this way in my mind and I don't think that most people think of supplementation is something that where you can induce a lot of variability in when and how you take them. But as far as I'm concerned as long as they're single ingredient formulations you can be you can use supplements once a week if you want you can use them seven days a week you could use them twice a day four times a day every day. Or you could use them not at all agreed. Yeah some of them will have an effect randomly like that others will not and we talked about creating being one of them. If you're going to take it once or so a week then there's I mean basically no benefit that's a very good point very. Creatines beta-allening as another fantastic example of something you need to take consistently if you want some sort of benefit. It needs to be built up in muscle we need to use that to create. Carnaxing which is what's actually going to help us with our fatigue management that's why we call it like an acid buffer. So in our previous metabolism episode we talked about that being a major cause of fatigue. The wonderful part of the real one of the reasons why beta-allening works effectively is it blocks that build up. So that is the good example of another one that you would want to take other things like fish oil. You could certainly skip a day here and there it wouldn't be that big a deal. I also do support your comment if you can take absolutely none of these things and and be just fine. In terms of and we'll come back maybe to beta-allening in a second. In terms of some other fun stuff my colleague Greg Asikki ran a really cool number of studies looking at how exercise actually altruistic at microbiome. This is actually an area that we probably have 300 stool samples sitting in my freezer in my lab. Goodness another reason to pause before entering your lab. Yeah another reason to not apply to come be one of my graduate students. And as you want to do with that we actually have a number we have applied for a couple of grants to look more in this specifically with females. So hopefully we can get that funded but nonetheless. You can actually see some like pretty traumatic and I say that word on purpose changes in the gut microbiome. This one of particular study I was thinking of that Greg did is he looked at the changes pre post and ultramarathon. And even within a single body of exercise. I came over to some of the markers but I know one of the markers was specifically increased by like 14,000%. After a single body of exercise now this is an ultramarathon. This is like totally absurd amount of exercise relative to a normal people would be. But that number I remember like it was like 14,229% or like something some random number like that of something meaningful. Yeah something meaningful. I can't remember which marker that was that had changed. I know Streptococcus was in there. Streptococcus went up maybe something more like 30 or 40 or 50%. The point is we haven't even had the proper time and we don't even launch into the gut microbiome. Supplementation there needs to be ultra specific. You wouldn't be best served to just jump in and take random things there. That's it's a whole area of emerging science. We know very very very little about it but there is a number of actionable things one could do there. So probably something to not mess with. We would certainly work with a qualified physician if you think you have something going on clinical or. You know some actual problem there. I don't work with someone who's not a specialist medical doctor there but just randomly assigning a bunch of probiotics or prebiotics without intention is maybe. The next forefront of human performance research but we'll have to maybe come back in a few years and dive into that in detail or. Perhaps you can bring somebody on as an expert in that to discuss that. Yeah, got microbiome as fascinating. I think of sleep as the most powerful performance enhancing. Activity. Of course you still have to do the activity. Yeah. I consider it foundational like it basically raises the tide on mental health, physical health, performance of all kinds. There's recent data that during sleep. Your body goes through all its various forms of metabolism possible. Yeah, which is amazing. So it's measured from breath in human subjects at breath metabolites in human subjects. So obviously, if one is thinking about supplementation and wondering, okay, what's the best supplement to enhance performance? You gave some great rationale for why creatine would be an excellent choice provided to your eating well and hydrating well. And then to my mind, the next thing on the list would be anything that allows you to improve the quality and maybe even the duration of your sleep. Although if you wake up in your field rested throughout the day and only need a short nap in the afternoon, not everyone needs one, but then generally that means you're feeling okay. People sometimes get flipped onto this idea that they have it in Somnia. In Somnia is excessive daytime sleepiness where you're falling asleep during the day. That's in Somnia could also be narcolepsy, but that's in Somnia. But supplementation to improve the quality or duration of sleep or both seems to me like the most direct route, even though actually technically it's an indirect route to performance enhancement. And then thinking about things that increase alertness and stimulants and fatigue reducers using that's a good logic. Yeah, we go to absurd lengths to dial sleep in as much as we can. I mean, the honest answer is like truly absurd. This is a conflict of interest that might, my company, I'm a part of this absolute rest is anyway that company. We actually go out to your house and run a full clinical grade sleep study in you, your bedroom on you and run that over multiple nights. So instead of having to go to a sleep clinic and have it done in this weird hospital room or sort of setting with these people looking at you through a mirror, it's like totally creepy. That is important because that's the only way to truly determine how you are sleeping. Now that said the technology of wearable trackers is getting better. In fact, I would actually predict those things will reach a level of accuracy equivalent to the BST and the next couple of years and probably will get FDA approval. So be able to diagnose officially sleep disorders. That's my total my prediction from some inside of remation. I don't know that to be true, but it is getting a lot better right now those wearables are not accurate enough to meet that threshold. We do is we bring up basically all the equipment to do that. So we'll come in and do that. Now once we understand exactly how you're sleeping, the next question is to answer why you're sleeping that way. And so this is a full fourfold system. Number one is we're going to look at biology, which means you're going to take saliva and blood. And we're looking at everything from neurotransmitters, concentrations to vitamins, BST, BST, B212, etc. That are important for sleep performance. So what we're going to see is that it is a physiological problem. Is there something happening there? Is cortisol, DHA ratio that we've previously talked about or is something like that off? If it's not physiology, then we're going on the next one, which is environmental. We want to full environmental scan of your bedroom during those nice of sleep that we're there. And that's really important because we can look at everything from dander and pollen and allergens that are in the air. A quick dip here is washed your sheets at least once a week. One of the common most common places that people get allergens in the air is actually from accumulation on your sheets. So if you clean those more often, you'll be in a better spot. And next one, the next one there also is like keep your, I'm sorry, this hurts my heart. I don't even bother. In truthfulness, I violate this, but keep your pets out of your bedroom and certainly keep them off your bed. Our go-swears killer is my dog and no keys in my other one. They don't go on my bed, but they're right next to my bed. So we violate that one. But full environmental scan includes all those things. Of course, there is, we measure light and temperature and humidity and everything else is going on in the room. Volodorganics that are coming out of the mattress from out of the high lead out of the wall. Like all these things that could potentially disrupt your sleep. And we want to make sure that none of those things are kicking on. We see this constantly. People will have things like trying to be cool and they want to be cold at night because that's important. And so they'll turn air conditioner on or a fan, but they air conditioner kicking on and off and night actually can shoot you out of various sleep stations. And we want to be really careful about this going. The last metric on that is actually CO2. And so remember from our metabolism discussion is when you exhale, you're breathing out CO2. Well, if your room is closed and the ventilation isn't great, the amount of CO2 in your room starts to build up. And we actually very specifically know the threshold based on information collected from the International Space Station actually. We know the threshold at which CO2 crosses and starts disrupting sleep. So we want to make sure that you're not sitting in this CO2 bath in front of your face and then breathing it back in and disrupting your sleep. So environment is the second one. The third one is actually now psychology. So one of the members on our team is a Harvard MD and psychiatry and put together an entire sleep scan survey. So we run through all that to see if there's anxiety, depression, anything like that. Psychologically going on. And then the fourth one there is if you have some sort of actual sleep pathology. And so this again will include some eye tracking stuff that we can use. So we take all those data. They go back to our team. We work in combination with Steve Locky from Harvard who's done a ton of stuff. He actually set up a lot of the circadian rhythm stuff in the International Space Station as well. I himself Jeffrey Dremmer and MD PhD is such a and all these folks in a room go over your data. Identify what's going on in the build action plans off of that occasionally those action plans will include supplementation. But only if necessary we're really going to try to come back and work through a system to improve the sleep. However, I need so I realize that is not totally accessible for a lot of people, but like if you really need to go to the end of the earth to figure out sleep. That service is available. Absolutely. It sounds like an amazing tool. Given that most people won't be able to use it or access it, although we will provide a link in case people are interested in it and do want to try it. You mentioned a few things that I think everyone should assay their sleep environment for and determine whether or not they are hindering their sleep without realizing it. But in the end of the day, the air conditioning going on and off or this could be heater going on and off or central heating or cooling unit. This could be keeping the room dark. This could be cleaning your sheets. Certainly, that doesn't require that one sign up for absolutely rest. So cleaning one sheets routinely keeping pets out of the bedroom, as you had admitted you don't entirely. The only thing that I'm going to do is to make sure that there are some of the things that interpolate the sleep conditions. But if you're having sleep issues, the standard for animals may be part of those issues. And then one that I'll just add, which I think is pretty interesting, is there's some beautiful data out of Michael Termin's lab at Columbia Medical School in New York on negative ionization. And there's a lot of biology for many decades now. Negative ion concentrations are higher near coastal locations. So if you've ever gone to the sea or gone on vacation and you sleep better near a body of water, that's actually a real thing. And there are negative ionization machines, but there are also some things that one can do in order to increase the negative ion concentration in their sleeping environment. That are nearly zero cost if not zero cost. You can look those up online. You probably will do an entire episode about this in the future, but I think what you described for absolute rest really highlights a more general set of themes that I think are really important, which is your sleep environment is an environment. It's got a lot going on in it. And it's worth running through the checklist that you described and asking, you know, where are things, you know, maybe not optimized, but where am I really getting in my own way in terms of sleep. All of this again being related to the fact that getting excellently consistently is a completely transformed everything that you do and not getting excellently consistently, which is a challenge for so so many people will also transform everything that you do and think and feel but in the negative direction. Yeah, I can also offer a few tips on sleep based on things we find most consistently for those that I can't go through the whole protocol. And one quick little actually app called time shifter is really cool for anyone that's dealing with consistent travel and jet lag. So you can go in enter your location, your time where you're going with the location and then it'll actually back calculate, you know, give you full light. Stimulate food, hydration, stuff protocol and you just follow along with that and we've used that for many years actually, especially when traveling like Abu Dhabi for advice and Mongolia and Brazil for the Olympics and sort all over the place. So that's I think that app is still available. I hope so. It's it's great. Nice to a couple of things we found major. If you're dealing with acid reflex, so if you're someone who has problems like that, you can just elevate the head of your bed by like six inches. So if you, you know, put little piece of wood or something underneath it, you can also buy very inexpensive pillows. That can elevate that now that's not solving the problem, but at least can help you sleep. It whether it's just that night or if it's a consistent problem, you can do there. If you're snoring like I said, it's not really benign. You should probably take a look at that. Your first step there is mouth tape. If that doesn't work, you can go through what's called myoc functional therapy, which I don't know if you covered that before, but it's basically tongue exercises. And that can be quite effective specifically for people who have problems with REM sleep. So myoc functional therapy, it's just a kind of like you do like Depending on the protocol, some tongue exercises kind of in the morning afternoon and night, and that takes a while to be honest. You're probably going to need at least six weeks before you start seeing anything, but that actually is pretty well demonstrated to help us sleep. So you can probably Google we could find a link for for exact protocols that I don't want to describe well them, but yeah, you can have strength in your tongue so that it stops falling in the back of your neck and waking you up at night. So that's a really free easy free protocol to use. If you're struggling with, it could be insomnia, but it could be just things like when you get into bed, you're super tired, you can't fall asleep or things like that. Kind of a basic rule of thumbly use is only two things happen in your bed. And if you can make sure those are the only two things you do in your bed, the problems of falling asleep and so I'm going to go down. Those two things are you have sex and you sleep and nothing else goes down in your bed. And so you can make that environment very special and that can help quite effectively improve your ability to fall asleep and then not wake up early. So keeping that environment specific to what it's for can be effective. The only other thing I would think of is, and I hate to say this because it's not super practical, but it's just quite clear at this point sleeping with a partner in your bed. It's just not very good for sleep. So good look with that one. I know you can do a couple of things if it helps. You can get two smaller beds and put them right next to each other. If you can actually have separate sheets, that alone can be helpful. So if you get, you know, if you're on a king size bed or something, I mean, I know some people, they're just like there's no chance, but if you want to know the cost for your like the effect of energy. You should use your loved one ideally. Please don't, please don't. Oh my goodness. The only last thing I want to mention here is something that's popped up just a few times recently, but you're going to see more of, which is called orthosomnia. So that is a term that is people are growing concerned over, which is wearables and sleep trackers, causing sleep issues. People basically become too obsessed with optimizing maximizing scores and that alone. Well actually, actually, you, so you learn when to wake up and so you have actually an anticipatory response when many hours prior to waking up. So if you actually learn to have a little bit of a, what's that little molecule of like excitement and reward? Oh, dopamine. That's the one. If you start getting that because you wake up and you get super excited to check your score or your, it's the same thing if you check your phone or Twitter or whatever in the meeting morning. That'll actually start carving back your wake up time because you start launching it. So it can runes sleep, becoming too obsessed. So what I'll say is if you're going to use a sleep tracker. And you just like don't carry on checking. You have fun with it. Great. But if you're like you are really, really, really interested in it and you pay a lot of attention to it. Don't check your sleep score for at least the first 60 minutes after waking up. And then you, that should help you. That's a great tool. I think they'll, and piece of advice, I think generally because I think, a lot of people are waking up with a million of the night checking their phone two or three times per night. I'm kind of wondering why they're doing that. And I'm guessing it's this anticipatory wake up circuit. Yeah, you absolutely should use either your night mode or do not disturb or airplane mode or something overnight or leave it out of the room. Yeah, I mean, if you have to wake up and like some people have like a family member who's maybe gotten great health. And so they have to get their phone around and case they call or things like that. So I get it. You're like, I can't leave it out. You leave it in there. Leave it in. Do not disturb and enter and their phone number or whoever's phone number. So only they can get through it. But keep it black and white. So if you do have to look at your phone at night, you see black and white and you do not have notification. So make sure that there's no notification for no email and then a new DM, like get all that stuff off your screen. And so you look at the, did anybody call? Did anybody text of importance? What time is it? No emergency going on black and white. Okay, right back to sleep. So that can help it little bit. One of the supplements that I've found is extremely useful for being able to fall back asleep. If I've woken up in the middle of the night and for some reason, can't. And is also very effective for enhancing sleep when one is ingesting fewer carbohydrates. And issue that a lot of people run into or for people that are fasting for many hours before sleep. You know, people are trying to not eat anything within two to four hours. But is it an ostatol 900 milligrams of my myo and ostatol. I find again, this is anic data to be clear. If I wake up in the middle of the night and I've taken 900 milligrams of an ostatol before initially falling asleep. That I fall back asleep much more easily. So that's why I've added 900 milligrams of an ostatol to my so called sleep stack. We'll also try just taking it alone and it works well alone, but it works better. Of course with the mag 3 and 8, Apagent and the Athenian sleep stack. The, also in terms of tools for sleep, the app of reverie that was developed by my colleague Dr. David Spiel who is a medical doctor at Stanford psychiatry, Stanford School of Medicine psychiatry. There is a free trial. There's a nominal cost if you use it month to month, but the data are really strong that people that use that I think it's 8 to 11 minutes sleep hypnosis once a week. And it doesn't have to be in the middle of the night when you wake up really helps improve people's ability to fall asleep quickly, stay asleep fall back asleep if they wake up in the middle of the night. And in the case is curing insomnia. In other cases, really just helping people with their general sleep issues. And I mentioned this because obviously it's a technology. It's not a supplement, but I know that some people are supplement of verse. Also, if you look at by at the cost comparison between taking the sleep stack totally and the reverie app, it's pennies on the dollar really. So again, I'm a proponent of both for myself, but I realize that people have varying budgets. And again, I should say as always behavioral tools first, and I think of the reverie app as more or less a behavioral tool. Yeah, it's it's really just a tool. Any of these birthwork protocols hypnosis protocols. They're just a tool for you to touch back in with your own physiology, rather than a substance that's coming in. So I fully support those. We have used a number of those in protocols. There's some other tricks that we can pull in those areas. I probably shouldn't say this, but the reality is depending on what's keeping you up. Sometimes we recommend just getting up and getting it done. Like if it's a really they gave it to a project or a thing or whatever. Like sometimes rather than laying their all night not sleeping, you can get up, get it done. And then if you stay awake, fine, at least the anxiety's gone. Or sometimes you guys should go back to sleep because you're like, especially if the task only literally would take like 10 or 15 minutes. And may ruin your sleep, but you're going to have room sleep. So you can try that tool. You don't want to pull that card very often and you have to be very careful with what you consider to be something worthy of doing that. But that is between me and you and nobody else here. That's the tool. I have used personal links more than a few times or it's just like I get an idea. I don't lose it or like the solution for something you've been doing for a long time. Bops in your head just like, and you're not wanting to forget it. Just get up and get it done and get on with your day. Several previous episodes you emphasized how exercise induces various adaptations depending on the type specificity volume intensity, etc. of the exercise. And that during exercise, the degree of adaptation that one triggers is often associated with things that normally we don't associate with exercise related health things like huge increases in blood pressure during exercise. Huge increases in inflammatory markers. Muscle damage. Things all sound terrible, but as you beautifully explained all of that triggers adaptations that then bring those markers below the baseline with which they were previous to the exercise. So that's the adaptation in the recovery. Within the realm of supplementation and nutrition, I'm aware of a number of things. Irbull, some lipid based, other compounds that are used for various things, but that are known to have a potent anti inflammatory effect things like omega-3 fatty acids. Ashoaganda for its effect on cortisol, although that's a bit indirect to the inflammatory pathway. Curricum and things of that sort. Given that we want inflammation in order to trigger the adaptation response to exercise. And given that we want to reduce inflammation in the recovery period, can we put together a logical framework as to when is best to take anything anti inflammatory, supplement based or prescription or over the counter drug and when to strictly avoid taking any anti inflammatory supplement or. But not behavioral tool you mentioned ice can reduce inflammation. That's why you don't want to do it too close to exercise. Anyway, I think you get the gist of the question. What about specific supplements related to. The way that I think about it is understanding what we call the fitness fatigue model. So what I mean by that is whenever you do some sort of insult, the whole idea is for you to come back and get an adaptation. Now recovery is not adaptation. My recovery recovery adaptation is what happens after you're recovered. So it's a very important distinction there. Fitness fatigue model says, basically you've done something and you've got an adaptation and you've enhanced fitness. And by fitness in this case, I mean it as a non-specific term. So you got stronger, you've improved your endurance, like whatever thing you're trying to train for. At the same time, though, you're fatigued elevated. So what happens is if fitness increases at the same or similar rate as fatigue, your performance actually isn't any better. And so you may think, oh, my program is working. I need to then train harder or I need to take more and I'm flamped or whatever the things are. When reality, all you really need to do is reduce fatigue. And if you do that, your performance will increase and all the training adaptations will be actualized. So the way that we do that is a couple of things. First and foremost is actually a taper. So the first step I think of if someone is training very, very hard and you're not seeing any results. And we want to think about supplementation. Before I get there, I want to think about taper and reload. If you're actually training hard and sleep and everything else is taking care of. So just without going too far into taper, some general parameters there. You want to think about about a 50% reduction in training volume over the course of about a week for every eight weeks of training. Super super rough, right? So if you've been training hard for three months for something, you might want a taper for two weeks. Something like that, right? It's sort of a rough estimate. That taper, you actually don't need to reduce intensity because intensity is not the driver fatigue. It tends to be volume. So as long as your volume is reduced by 50%, you can maintain intensity. You can maintain, in fact, I generally would recommend maintaining frequency. So if you used to work it out four days a week, keep it four days a week. You can go down a little bit in frequency. But if you go down too much in frequency, you actually tend to feel super lethargic. So I wouldn't do that. If you do those things correctly, you can typically see somewhere between like a 3 to 8% room in performance within a matter of days. So it's important to do that. We actually ran a study on cross country runners years ago, testing on a metabolic heart, muscle biopsies, blood, a whole bunch of things. And we did it pre and post three weeks of taper. And we actually, this is cool because we did this in competitive season. So as we're collegiate cross country runners. And we got them to come to our lab three weeks before their conference championship. Ran them all through a bunch of testing biopsies them. They went through their three week taper and then we biopsied them again. And then they went and ran their conference championships. So well, what happened was they ended up hitting about a 50% reduction because what they did is they took out what we call the junk volume. So they kept their race tempos, high intensity stuff in there. They kept their recovery stuff and then that medium pace, they just basically reduced. Now they were terrified as any endurance runner or a derits out later participant would understand when you take volume away, they tend to get very nervous. And so they didn't like that. But as a result of that, what we saw is their VO2 max despite the fact that they covered half the mileage. Their VO2 max did not go down in three weeks or reduced taper. Your fitness is extremely stable. And in fact, once we actually looked at their data, the enzymes in their muscle were responsible for oxidative metabolism were maintained. And so you don't have to worry about losing again fitness, whether to talk about overall performance or even oxygen capacity, mitochondrial function, etc. That was all preserved. Obviously we saw performance go up. It was actually really interesting. As we saw, I think it was around a 10% increase in type 2, which are fast twitch muscle fiber size. So we saw a 10% increase in fast which fiber size at the end of three weeks of tapering. Now, what you may think is like, wow, I guess tapering is anabolic, but that's probably not what happened. What realistically probably happened was their volume of training was actually causing their fibers to be reduced to size. And then once we removed that fatigue, they just recovered back to normal. So that's a good example of what I'm talking about. Once you remove the fatigue, you can actually see and has this in performance, not because you're necessarily getting better, but because you're removing the semi-light supply. The way that you want to think about recovery like this is although recovery, especially like injury recovery, like seems chaotic, biology is very organized. And there's a very specific three step process that you're going to go through for recovery. And then there are different supplements that can help you in each of those three areas. So area one is basically inflammation. So this is when the side of chimes dorm comes rolling out. It starts signaling the injuries there, in this case even if it's muscle damage, and activates immune system to kick on and that whole repair process happens there. What you're trying to do effectively, in fact, this is why you probably never wonder why is inflammation a thing. What you're trying to do is bring in fluid and hand-sacize and increase blood flow ends, so you can get nutrients for repair and immune cells and everyone in that in the system and get the waste out. So short-term inflammation, even in the case of muscle soreness, is the example we talked about in the previous episode. But any inflammation, it is part of the necessary process. That's why you would not want to take an anti-inflammatory in that state. And so why you also would not want to do things like an ice bath. So in that immediate inflammatory response time window, this is, you know, seconds to hours after training, you would want to stay away from things like that. A good option here are things like omega-3s. Good evidence, some somewhere in the neighborhood of like 2 to 5 grams total, typically like a 1 to 1 EPA to DHA ratio is fine. Similarly, this is another example of when good doesn't mean more is better. For example, there is actually evidence showing up to 15 grams, will harm the immune response. And so you don't just want to be like, man, I'm super sore, I'm trained harder, I'm just going to go to 10 grams in a more and more. You're actually causing yourself more of a problem. So anti-oxidant anti-inflammatories are fine. Again, I'll make a 3 in that dosage or a decent thing. You can also do something like 500 milligrams of curcumin three times a day. That's going to be enough to keep you in a decent spot. There are some other things that you could look up maybe some potential benefit for ginger and best well in some things like that for inflammation. But under unless we're in like very specific circumstances where we have like an injury, we're probably not going to those, you know, areas. I just wanted to highlight one thing that came up in the previous episode, some not all people, but some including myself are very sensitive to curcumin. It has a very potent effect in reducing DHT, DHT hydrogestosterone and leads all sorts of clamping of testosterone-associated positive things. So I have experienced that myself. I've had people write to me and say, I don't understand. I start taking a supplement. And curcumin's supposed to be a great anti-inflammatory. It flatline my libido. It took away my drive and kind of wondering what's going on there. Those people are very likely to be very DHT sensitive. Curcumin, while it's a potent anti-inflammatory, can also put only reduced DHT. But some people tolerate it quite well. And are hearing this and probably think that's ridiculous. Well, it's certainly substantiated by the chemical pathways that curcumin taps into in the known roles of DHT on libido aggression, power output, et cetera. And mood. So just be wary that there's no way to predict this. One simply has to figure it out empirically. Meaning you have to try and see if you like it or don't. The good news is, is those negative effects on DHT seem to reverse pretty quickly after c-sing to take curcumin. So just a mention of something that came up in a previous episode, but in case people didn't hear that segment, just want to highlight those facts. Further evidence, do I strongly discourage? Strongly discourage, taking anything in the anti-inflammatory anti-oxid around. Unless you actually have a reason to do so. If you're waking up and maybe I'm in flame, that's probably not a good approach. Let's have a reason to do so. Step two is actually what we call proliferation. And that's kind of like the cleanup crew. That's when you're going to be going in there and cleaning out dead cells and debris and missile deprotemes and things like that. At this stage, a fantastic evidence-based supplement is good to me. Good to me in 20 grams a day. We typically honestly split it up into two dosage. 10 grams, morning, 10 grams, night. It's a conditional amino acid, which means you can make it. Your body can make enough of it at times and other times you may want to support it. Generally, those conditional times are things like burn victims, high stress situations or injury, things like that. So there isn't also like a ton of downside to glutamine because it can go through transamination, which means your body can take it and say like, We don't need anything here for our muscle recovery. Let's make it into something else and use it for whatever else is needed. So it's kind of another one of these like low risk products is also why you see it in a lot of recovery products. If you're ever wondering, like, what the heck is that in there? I don't need amino acids and you're thinking it's like for protein synthesis. It's really not. It's because of this, it is beneficial to this proliferation process. I've been taking glutamine for years. I tend to take it in higher dosages several times throughout the day if I'm ever feeling particularly run down. I know they're decent data, not great, but decent data on the role of glutamine for leaky gut. Totally. We're off saying leaky gut. That's getting a little bit into the realm of like not super well substantiated, but in the peer reviewed literature, but a lot of anecdata and certainly some peer reviewed work but not a ton. And then there is also growing interest in the idea that glutamine because it can trigger activation of the neurons in the gut that signal to the dopamine pathway in the brain, that it can be used to offset sugar cravings. This is kind of an interesting new and emerging theme, which makes sense given the biology of the neurons in the gut that respond to specific amino acids, including glutamine, essential fatty acids and sugar. And because they respond to any and all three of those, anyone or combination of those, I should say, to trigger this dopamine response. Some people have taken to a teaspoon or so of glutamine in some water or other drink a couple times throughout the day as a way to reduce their sugar cravings because what's essentially doing is it's tricking the pathway into activation of those neurons through an alternate, a ligand receptor interaction. Also another interesting point, there are very, I'm trying to think right now if something I had, I can't think of a time and I've used glutamine a lot. I can't think of a time where I've ever heard anybody come back with any side effect reports. I think if you take enough of it, you can get some gastric distress, but of course you take enough of any powdered substance. It makes him water, you're going to get a gastric distress response. What I've noticed about gastric distress with things like creatine, glutamine, and even protein powder, so that matter I use a high quality way protein powder routinely, is that if you build up to it over the course of a few days, then you can get away with using much higher dosages without any issue. I'm going to have a bit of an alanine, but we talked about that earlier. If you've ever tried that, oh my gosh, I feel like I've just rolled around and grasped my skin and it's itching everywhere. I can't understand the skin sensation. You can just take a little bit of a lower dosage and be fine, but for the most part, and then you will build up a tolerance to that pretty quickly, so you can up that dosage along the way. So what we will often times do there start at a dosage that's pretty minimal like two grams. And then every week or so you can go up another gram until you get to whatever final point you want to be five six grams day, whatever. So that's another way you can sort of mitigate that problem. So the first step in this recovery process after inflammation proliferation, we're now into remodeling and this is when you're actually, you know, quote, unquote growing back bigger and stronger. This is where the majority of the repair is actually taking place and at this point we're basically playing a micro nutrient and macro nutrient game right by that I mean we've talked about basic macro nutrients. One thing to pay attention to often times if people are hurt whether they're had an injury or they've had just their super sore and they are concerned about eating excess calories. They tend to want to eat less food during this process because you're like I'm not working out so much so I'm going to eat less calories. One of the things that you have to pay attention to is injury can increase based on metabolic rate by up to 10%. So what you want to do in general is just take your calories up about 10%. At least that's what I recommend. If that is an extended period of time then yes, you may put on a slight amount of body fat or something. But if that also means you come back some percentage faster than it's worth the exchange. So we recommend that in terms of your carbohydrate or fat split, I'm not super worried about it. My general recommendation is just don't make any major changes relative to what you were doing. Keep yourself pretty much in the same spot. In terms of protein this is the big one. You want to make sure you are absolutely at one gram per pound of body weight because we need those amino acids to come in and start helping with recovery. One gram of protein per pound of body weight or more or one gram. Yeah, and there's going to be very little downside to having more. Remember protein and carbohydrates both stimulate insulin and remember insulin is anabolic. And so we're trying to drive this process of recovery. That's why you want both. So you wouldn't want to skimp on carbohydrates in this phase. Nor would you want to skimp on protein because you need the activation, the drive into the tissue as well as the structure. Going back to one of our earlier conversations and at this point in the week. I honestly can't remember at all what episode we covered this in. But I gave it an analogy about using making a campfire and using fat and carbohydrates as the wood and the log and the protein were the the metal structure. So you need that supply if you're trying to make if you've cleared out in the previous step. Damage proteins and you need to make new ones to recover that process. You have to have the raw supply and material. So you wouldn't want to avoid either one of those things. There's actually some indirect inflammation management that comes from fatty acids, but you actually sort of alluded to earlier. I don't think you need a necessarily go crazy. You didn't need to change your fat intake that much. Just don't drop it. You know, depending on what you're at. So if you're a little bit of a higher carb lower fat person. Great. If you're moderate, great. If you're the indirect. If you're higher fat, lower carb person. Awesome. Just don't make an extreme change and don't try to not be on the extremes of either one of those ratios. But the only specific number to pay attention again is that protein number. And if you go a little bit high or even a lot high, it's totally fine. Just don't go low. So that's the the macronutrient portion of remodeling. In terms of micro nutrients to be honest, you just get your basis covered. This is one a basic multi vitamin. It is effective. What you're really trying to look at here are vitamin A and zinc. They actually have independent mechanisms that are helpful here. But those are typically covered in most multi vitamins. So we generally just give people a multi vitamin. Magnetism is actually has some benefits here. Something like six milligrams per kilogram of body weight is the dosage you're looking for there. Magnetism citrate is probably has the most evidence in terms of this respect. But it doesn't mean I actually have no reason to think you couldn't use glycinate or if you're using another form for sleep. That probably fine. I don't know that for sure. But I can't think of a reason why the other forms of magnesium would all the sudden not work. So you could probably choose whichever form you like. Obvious citrate has probably the most research in this aspect. The only other things you would probably consider here. Three things. Calcy might be on your list particularly if you're trying to. If you're concerned with some sort of bone injury and we sort of gone past like recovery and we're actually like into injury. So you see that in recovery products occasionally and that's why. And then the last two ones of course are vitamin D and that's pretty well researched. And then the last one is actually something that can help you if you're at this stage. And you still are dealing with a lot of soreness or not and that is tart cherry juice and that's actually effective for both doms muscle injury muscle soreness. And actually has another benefit of potentially aiding with sleep. So I'm not a bad one to turn to as well. And there's a number of companies that make these things. Yeah and then there's actually more ongoing research that I know of on those areas but promising literature will say not often but everyone's in a while. So on this podcast I will solicit social media for questions from the audience where I should say the audience to be and then ask some of those questions on the fly during the podcast. I did this with Dr. Lex Friedman. I'm going to do it with you. Your goal is to answer each of these questions. Certainly not all of them. Within the last couple of hours to answer each of these questions. In three or four sentences. I certainly won't be counting the number of sentences that you speak. So just know that if you want to go over a little bit that's fine. But feel free to refer to your Instagram site at a future time where you might go more in depth or to refer to a study or if you like you can also say pass if you don't think that you can answer the question. So it's so fascinating as I'm a person in the sense that all of this in the last couple of hours isn't clear for us to extend it through each of those hugs. But because it's extremely novelty, it feels like a reality is not necessarily a recruit, but it is emphasise the reason I'm interested in thinking about people. A job is a planner in the adventures of driving your business. It's quite amazing idea where we go, but I don't like the advantage. to the reminder. This is not directly related to supplementation, but it is related to nutrition. And I don't think we touched on this directly. Can we do intermittent fasting, aka timerster confeding, with keto, and still gain muscle mass? TBD. I am quite clear, such study does not exist. So I don't know. I think I've alluded to before that we did run intermittent fasting, 168 high-perch fee study. There was no keto arm. The result of that study, at the time this comes out, we'll probably be ready if they're on not sure. So I can't comment on it, I haven't looked at the data. But regarding whether I've heated that with keto or not, I can't comment scientifically. Do you ever prescribe the use of GABA supplements? Well, I can't prescribe anything to make sure we're clear. But you're a professor, you can profess. We generally don't spend too much time on GABA. Rarely. Is it okay to wait trained fasted than not break the fast and eat for three or four hours after training? So in other words, train fasted, I do this. But then also not eat immediately following training and wait another three to four hours after training. Once we have our results from intermittent fasting study, back we will have a better answer here. My general recommendation as it stands now, is as long as your total protein intake is sufficient. You should be in a decent spot. Great. A lot of questions about fasting and training just to Yeah, I know that. Can you train high performance fasted and how long before you need to refuel the body? Yeah, you can certainly do that. I know of actually many athletes, some athletes, so we'll do that. Though the vast majority will not. As it gets higher and higher in intensity and or duration, it gets more challenging. But it really does come down to what you did the day before as well. So if you ate sufficient calories the day before, didn't train and your glycogen stores are topped off. You have a fighting chance. Now the duration part of that equation is really dependent upon you. So are you really talking 30, 45 minutes, 60 minutes? You're probably fine. Whether you're out past that in several hours, you may not be. And then the only other comment I would make is there is keep in mind whenever you think about fasting and any other, let's say against the textbook, you know, quote unquote strad style, you really really need to be careful in thinking the difference between can I do it and is it optimal? So I have absolutely no reason to think fasting like that would improve performance. I only work for the most part of the people who are trying to perform the highest level possible. So I can't think of a scenario which I would go too fasting to try performance. So whether or not you can maintain some level of performance probably, we'll provide any benefit. I struggle to find scenarios in which that would actually make you perform better. How do different forms of carbohydrates impact performance and then right below it, another question about carbohydrates which is does carbohydrates cycling work. So these are two questions from people that I think don't know one another, but a lot of questions about carbohydrates and performance, but it's not much done anything else that you want to add to that conversation. I don't think I really, maybe you might want to think about carb loading slash carb cycling. So carbohydrate loading does help. However, a misconception there is it's just, you know, a big bowl of pasta the night before. That can help top off storages, but really optimal carbohydrate loading prior to a long duration endurance performance is probably best over the course of three or four days. So you want to gradually increase carbohydrate intake for multiple days, rather than just have one big bowl of pasta. Branch chain amino acids and essential amino acids supplementation. Yay, nay or as I would say, me. Uh, me. Usually if your total protein intake is fine, then you don't really have a need for them. If you're, for whatever any number of valid reasons, total protein is not, then going to an essential amino acid would be my first step rather than a BCA. Now admittedly, we actually do use essential amino acids somewhat regularly because it's, it's also sort of like a, there's no real harm other than if your price conscious and you're sort of like I'm wasting money, that's fine. The people I work with generally again, that's not a few dollars for the maximize. Recovery is not that very. So we will sometimes use that pre-mitter post training in some circumstances. Total protein would be my, I did a high quality way, something like that. If you can't use way for whatever reasons, there are plenty of high quality vegan proteins you could use. If you want to top all that off though, and add some essential amino acids, it wouldn't hurt anything and may potentially help slightly. So you choose based on that algorithm. Ah, I was hoping somebody would ask this, I touched on it a little bit. It's a little bit of a loaded question the way they phrased it. So at risk of leading the witness, does the mythical anabolic window really exist? And I'm just laughing, because the way they pose the question, they're already telling us what their stance is. Making it more effective as to create high-perrophy to eat within a certain timeframe after working out. I'm going to assume that this person genuinely wants to know, whether or not the anabolic window really exists or not, because they refer to it as mythical. I'm going to assume that they're suspicious, but what's the deal is the anabolic window a real thing? The post-sacrific anabolic window is extremely real. So what this is, you can see more detail in a number of videos on my YouTube page, I believe. It is the idea that you need to must consume some sort of nutrient, specifically, usually protein in some time domain, 30 or 60 minutes, a post-sacrific an order to maximize growth. So is that when do real, yes, are you hypersensitized to nutrients in that timeframe? Yes, is it very important that you rehydrate, replenish muscle glycogen, and rebuild tissue quickly after you exercise to maximize recovery? Absolutely. It's not real, though, in the sense that you have to have it within 30 minutes. In the case of protein, as we talked about a second ago, your total protein intake throughout the day is more important. Timing, though, four things like carbohydrate, especially if you're training multiple times a day, it is very real. So it is a very real thing. It's just, you may or may not actually care about it. It may not be important for your context. Garlic seems like an appropriate question. What if any functional roles does garlic have in performance? Garlic's actually really cool. There's a number of things you can dive into that are outside of my three to four sentences, considering I'm at like two and a half probably already. You're not going to find strong human data on garlic extract. However, there is a little bit suggesting it can actually enhance recovery from injury, or potentially tissue damage. So you've got to kind of be careful, though, because in order to understand what's happening, you have to differentiate between innate and adaptive recovery processes. And when we say things like immunity, realize friends, that's not one thing. That's just like a very colloquial term for a number of things. Again, it's a verb. Like it's a noun, right? The immune system, but it immunity is a bunch of processes or processes. If you're about to correct my speech, I'll correct yours right back. Not yours, Andy. Yeah. Yeah. Process, but tomato, tomato, it's a verb. Immunity is a verb. This is my problem with immune boosters. Same issue, right? You're like, well, what are you boosting specifically? Because in fact, if you're boosting the wrong part of immunity during the wrong phase of recovery, with garlic, you may be actually hurting the process, because you're theoretically could be trying to downregulate that portions that you've got to upregulate an next portion. That's the faster way to say it, if you will. So we actually, you may see more data come out that says the garlic extracts now overrated. I don't actually don't even know yet. We just don't have enough human data on it, but yeah, there's some stuff there. If you want to look hard enough, I'm going to ask this question for myself, because I'm curious to know the answer yourself, as tart cherry extract. Pretty effective, actually, for two things, potentially, hey, eating in sleep, getting sleep as well as muscle soreness, that's the bulk of the research is in muscle soreness, and seems to be a moderate factor. I think for people that might be interested in dosages of things like tart cherry extract, garlic, et cetera, obviously, Dr. Andy Gallpins Instagram and Twitter, a great place to ask questions like that, and to find questions, answers to questions like that, as well as examin.com as a terrific website. They actually recently overhauled their entire website, so they have this human effect matrix that shows the effects and the strength of different effects in human studies of many, many different compounds, relating to hormone health and men and women, sports performance, cognitive performance, it doesn't cover everything, but it certainly covers a lot with links to studies. There's a lot that's available at completely zero cost by joiningexamin.com. You can access some additional features, and this is, by the way, not a paid endorsement from examin.com. I'm simply a long time user of examin.com myself, and so I just want to cue people to it. And again, many of the resources there are available completely free of costs. It's a wonderful site. So for dosages of garlic, tart cherry extract and things of that sort, whether or not you're getting it from food or getting it from extract, or sourders, rather, all of that information is pretty nice to laid out there. So unless you have something to add to that, I was just going to cue people to that resource. I've been using that since the first date website was launched. I was made aware that it was coming, unfortunately, to know those guys for a while. So yeah, I've used it. I used it all my classes. I don't even know probably weekly at this point. Another nice feature that's actually on there is they have a series of, like, they'll do some topical reviews basically. So they'll write a big paper out on muscle damage or blood pressure or testosterone, testosterone, testosterone, and so on. Or hormone, you menstrual cycle and yeah, PCOS, I think they do one on and all kinds of stuff. You can search by topic like energy or recovery or whatever. Or you can search by black human, see the extractor, like whatever number of things you want to do. And I'll also tell you if there's any interactions to pay attention to. So it's really, really nice. So be carefully for taking A and B or whatever. So yeah, it's wonderful, wonderful. Yeah, they've done a marvelous job. So thank you, examin.com, keep up the amazing work. Well, we've come close to the end of this episode. And that means that we're close to the end of this series where you have so graciously joined us for six full episodes of the Hewbroom and Lab podcast to educate us on all things fitness. And that's the first episode. One, you reviewed and educated us on assessing our level of fitness. In fact, I learned so many ways of assessing fitness that I had not thought about and also assessing my recovery capacity for instance. One thing that I'm definitely going to implement from that episode is a routine broad jump test. And in home, high jump and touch test, if people don't know what I'm referring to that's all contained in that episode, it's time stamped. These are very straightforward, zero cost ways to assess one's level of fitness. There are a few others that require a bare minimum of technology like taking your pulse rate in very specific ways as specific times. Also, some timing of myoruns and some other things related to strength and hypertrophy and on and on. Really, it's a, it's a buffet of options that we can select from. And I already know the four or five that I started implementing this week. I've recognized how I'm pretty good in a couple of areas. I'm doing maybe maybe better than pretty well in one area, but then I'm doing a. I'm probably poorly in a few areas that I just wasn't aware of. And so I've already started taking on ways to adjust that over time and I'll keep people posted. So that first episode was absolutely incredible. And we just provide so much actionable knowledge and the rationale behind it. The second episode you educated us about strength, speed and hypertrophy training. And there too, an immense amount of incredible knowledge. We got way down into the details. You explained sets reps. The rationale for sets reps rest cadence, number of workouts per week. I'm definitely going to take away my need to do some speed based training and some power based training. Normally, I think in terms of strength or hypertrophy. And I'm relieved to learn that a lot of the speed and power based training. It's low intensity enough that it can be done fairly often and incorporated into my program, which is already touches on strength and hypertrophy. And indeed some endurance work as well. So amazing tips that you provided there. I'm certainly going to implement the 3 to 5 program that you describe 3 to 5 exercises done for 3 to 5 repetitions. 3 to 5 minutes between sets. You're doing this 3 to 5 times per week and so on and so forth. All the details again timestamped in the strength and hypertrophy episode show note. So just incredible. We even use that to set up PR with you this week. That's right. I did PR this week. Thanks. Thanks to your input and following that program. And I'm really grateful for that. It does feel good to break through a barrier. And I intend to break through more barriers. But not just with strength and hypertrophy because episode 3, you taught us all about endurance. The four different forms of endurance. How to train for each of those different forms. The value of doing even very brief 20 second sprints or bounce of jumping jacks throughout the day, which to some people might just sound like a, you know, like a little hack or a gimmick. But no, these are actually tapping into fuel systems and modes of neural muscular interactions that greatly aid other forms of endurance like long duration endurance. I would love to return to my high school mile time. I won't reveal what that is because this is not really about me. But I plan to start doing, if not mile repeats, then doing some mile, mile runs and testing there once a week. You laid out a beautiful program for how to do that. And then in the next episode, you wowed us again with a description of the science and the tools and this right down to the details, but all laid out very cleanly and clearly as to how to design an optimal fitness program. What are the things that really represent an optimal program? What questions does one have to answer before designing a program? What are some of the barriers in the way? This concept of defenders as things that prevent you from reaching your goals. And one of the key things I have it right here in front of me that I took away from that episode is was this quadrant approach of really thinking about and figuring out how much one intends to devote to work career calling. Let's make that one bin. Relationships. Another bin fitness in the other bin and recovery in the other bin. And here we'll tip our hats are good friend Kenny Kane for mentioning that. Overall, scheme for doing things has been immensely useful and I've actually charted it out and thought about and drawn out which different things fall in each of these categories. You might think it's obvious. Okay, relationships. But that includes a lot of different things and there's crossover between these bins in terms of how you can combine enhancing relationships with fitness work recovery and so on. So that episode is just again a treasure trove of knowledge. And then in the next episode you educated us on recovery in all its forms in the very short term within the workout immediately after the workout and from workout to workout. Ways to really accelerate recovery assess recovery and as you pointed out for people like me who always assume that we don't recover very well in that some sort of character trait. Another system thing or genetic to really think about how my training is impacting my level of recovery and in doing so is revealed to me that I have far more capacity than I thought I had and already this week I've managed to train more often. Doing more work and I feel better than ever. And that's also despite the fact that we've spent a fair amount of time in these chairs across from one another. It's been a pleasure and then in today's episode you explained nutrition and supplementation as it relates to performance and of course that touches into recovery but also optimal mental states for training. How do approach one's training and how to extract the most from training through quality nutrition. So what to eat and when which carbohydrates protein amounts windows of opportunity windows you absolutely don't want to miss and then something that are a bit more flexible and then we went. Deep into the weeds of magnesium garlic tertiary extract alpha gpc we touched on neural transmitter related systems hormone related systems. We went deep into a discussion about sleep because of course sleep is the foundation for recovery and performance of all kinds emotional mental and physical recovery and performance and in taking us through this enormous arc of a journey through fitness. I think it's fair to say that you've given us your knowledge containing your head I was telling someone just the other day that one of the things that I always lamented in science is that I would encounter these incredible professors and scientists. In other domains of life too and you just wish there was some way to download their brain because it's so much knowledge inside them and I'm looking for a USB or USB-C port on you and I don't see one yet but what you've effectively done for us across these six episodes is to download the actionable knowledge and you know it's wonderful the information you've provided is clear. It's super interesting it's highly highly actionable and in many cases it's counterintuitive and surprising but once one understands the logic behind it as you've provided for us also. Then it all makes sense in a way that's extremely satisfying and extremely motivating so it's certainly motivating me to change the way that I train in a number of ways and I promise that I'll report back to our audience and to you as to what my results are but really. As we both agree this is not about me this is not about you this is really about the people listening and so for those of you listening I hope you can appreciate what an incredible gift it is to have somebody of Dr. Annie Galpons experience and. Drive and scholarly background who also works with athletes and everyday people just to play out all this knowledge for us systematically over six episodes. Dr. Andy Galpon thank you ever so much. I appreciate that far too kind of words to me there if you've been following along through this entire journey as you called it you know I like first principles thinking and I like lists so I'm going to get you with one more list and I got five things on this final list get your pen and pad out please. Number one I want to really emphasize. Science itself is a verb which means it's ongoing in changing I did my best over the course of these many many many hours to provide my interpretation of the science. To provide my practical knowledge and things that I use but that's fallible science changes there are many many things in my career that I was very sure the evidence was clear on and then it changed. So as you move forward do not think of any the recommendations I gave you whether they were about supplement dosages and timing rep ranges or breathing tactics anything in between. Just use them as guidelines so. Number one science is a verb. Number two I really want to thank the audience this has been an extremely long haul and as some of you have somehow I'm sure which I'm not sure how but some of you have probably made it through this entire journey and listen to all six episodes and. You should probably get some sort of free human lab shirt or something or a plaque or I don't know how about a galvan plaque. Oh got them black how about an internet high five. And even if you just dropped in for a few of the episodes you know I appreciate you taking the time as a lot of things you could be doing with your time and to make to spend those resources on my words is touching. Number three. I want to actually thank you of course Andrew and the whole team and the crew up here for three things. Number one I think it's incredibly important that you have gone out of your way to give other people credit for their work you go out of your way on your large platform social media to tag people. To give science is credit for their work most people do not do that and that's something you don't have to do and I think that is a culture. You know I know why you do you come from science that's just what you do you get people credit for their work, but you go out of your way to do that and so I want to thank you for that. The next one is. Many people who have. Outlets and platforms will try to fill those with people who are going to grow their platforms. It doesn't mean these people are wrong or bad but I think what's extremely special about what you've created here is again you have gone out of your way to bring on the direct source of information. I can't even imagine how many of your podcasts. Guess have never been on a podcast before or have been on a very short number of them and you've made an extremely large platform doing nothing but talking about super deep dark science directly from the science of themselves. And to create a community like that it's. I'm so happy that science is is made up here and you shown the world. People are stupid people want detail and people want science and you've given us them. And the last one of course see if I get through this is. Thank you for you done for me my career I understand there could have been any number of people in this chair. To put me on your platform once was. And I'm going to be a big gracious. But to do it for. Six hundred hours or whatever we did in this series is. I can't thank you enough for that opportunity so I hope I lived up to it and I had a tremendous time and thank you for being such a gracious host. Well you more than exceeded expectations you are absolutely the person to be in this chair talking about these topics with me and for the world. And. And once again I just want to say thank you.

vid00003," Welcome to the Human Lab guest series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and optymology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode is the fifth in a six episode series on fitness exercise and performance. And today's episode is all about recovery that is how to maximize your recovery to achieve your fitness and exercise in performance goals and how to avoid over training. Dr. Andy Gelpin, great to be back. Today we're discussing recovery and I'm very excited to have this discussion because as we know, despite the fact that different types of exercise can be used to trigger different types of adaptation, such as increased long distance endurance, anaerobic capacity, strength, hypertrophy, etc. The workouts themselves are not actually when the progress occurs, when the adaptation occurs. And this to me is extremely interesting because it parallels what we see with so called neuroplasticity, which is the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience. We sit down to learn something, we experience something, and that is the trigger for rewiring of the nervous system. But the actual rewiring occurs away from the experience or the learning. So to in fitness and in exercise recovery is where the real results actually emerge where we get better. So I'd love for you to explain what recovery really is and the different types of recovery, certainly different ways to enhance recovery. And I'd also love for you to explain whether or not there are ways that people can become better at recovering because if indeed recovery is when progress emerges, when we get better, will then anything that supports our recovery and gets us better at recovering, ought to increase our rate in our degree of progress. Absolutely, you nailed it in the description. What people really want is some sort of change. Whether you're talking athletes or general population, this change is some sort of improvement in muscle function, reduction in body fat, higher functioning metabolism, whatever the case is. And the only way that happens is we talk about the equation of stress causes adaptation, but as you alluded to, the piece in the middle is only if you can recover from it. And so the game we're playing here is we all agree we want more adaptation. That means we need to bring more stress in this system, but we then have to ensure that our recovery outpaces, the stress input or else we will know adaptation will occur in effect. What happens is you will actually be in a negative spot and start going backwards. And so what I would love to do is talk about how we've handled this. And I've had a decent amount of experience here. I was fortunate enough to do my masters degree in the laboratory of a gentleman named Andy Fry, who's an NSEA lifetime achievement award winner. And he studied in large part recovery, overtraining, overused, overload in a lot of areas. In addition, I've been fortunate enough to work with individuals from high functioning CEOs and executives who have little time for recovery, high job stress. To and to athletes, and think of the example of pitchers in major like baseball who have to recover in a matter of four days that they can pitch again at maximum velocity. So I would love to outline some of the tools and tactics strategies that we use for all these individuals. I'll give you some foundational stuff and I would love to maybe actually cover some things that most people have never heard of. Some stuff you may not have access to some technologies that we use, some biomarkers. And then even a whole bunch of things that are keeping with the theme of your show here, cost free or extremely low costs. All those strategies, what I would also like to do is cover nutrition, supplementation and fueling and hydration and things. But that's probably going to have to be saved for an additional conversation that we'll do in the next episode. Yes, so we will absolutely hold a conversation about nutrition and supplementation where you can educate us about all the top contours stuff all the way down to the fine details. I do have a question about recovery and it's one that I think most people are familiar with themselves, which is soreness. We think of it as a muscle soreness, but I was trained early on in my scientific career to always question the seemingly obvious. So a couple of questions about soreness. First of all, what does soreness really reflect? Is it really muscle soreness? It feels like it's in the muscles. But what other organ systems and tissues and cell types does it involve? And then I'm particularly interested in this. Uncept or this experience that many of us, including myself, had, which is delayed on set muscle soreness. Why would it be that when we are less in shape or when we perform a movement that is extremely novel to us? The soreness seems to arrive after a reasonable delay of maybe even a day. You know, we're finding the next day with them 48 hours later. We are exceedingly sore. And as we get more fit or more familiar with the movement, the soreness seems to arrive earlier. So I realize that just asked you about three questions or more. First of all, what is muscle soreness? I had a cell or level, which cells, which organ systems and so forth. What does it mean if we are sore is something I know we'll get into a little bit later. And then why the delayed onset muscle soreness? It's actually one question. So it's totally fine. You answered all three. Because I'm actually answering number three, which will answer number two, which will actually answer number one. I'd love to tell you that I set it up that way intentionally. But I'm just happy to hear that where I was unable to be concise, you are able to be concise. Yeah. We are still learning a lot about this area. It's actually really difficult to perform these studies. Anytime you ask a question about something like pain or soreness, you're immediately talking about perception. And there is obviously a physical component to that and there's also perception. And so teasing those things out is extraordinarily challenging. That said, there has been a lot of work in this area. And in fact, probably you may have a filler already out on pain or maybe once coming down the road. We did an episode on pain a while ago, but it's definitely time to revisit that literature. I also have some amazing colleagues at Stanford who work on pain both from the cellular and molecular side, but also from the psychological side about how our understanding of pain and what we believe about pain shapes the experience of pain and pain relief. Amazing. That's that stuff is incredibly important. And I'm glad we flag that and maybe we'll just call that good for now. They can come back later for another one of your shows. So that being said, why does it happen? 28 to 48 hours after you exercise? Well, that actually should give you some clues into what's happening. So the traditional dogma of delayed onset muscle soreness is what this is called, is that it is a result of micro tears. And the muscle. And so you can sort of think, I challenge the muscle. There were some small tears in there, and I'm feeling the result to that. Well, in fact, that certainly does happen and it can happen. That is not what's explaining your muscle soreness. And in fact, you can be quite sore from exercise and have no measurable amount of muscle damage. And so much like anything else who are in this idea of pain, it's not a one to one explanation. There are multiple factors that are probably causing your perception of pain. Muscle damage can be one of them. It is not the only one. It is probably, in my opinion, though this is yet to be shown definitively, probably not even the leading cause of it. So what's actually happening? Well, the reason it's taking you 24 to 48 hours is you can actually find various papers, literature reviews, dating back in a number of years now, over a decade, that show these wonderful curves of an inflammatory and immune response. And we don't need to necessarily go through the entire physiology right now. But effectively what's happening is those things have a little bit of a time delay. And so some of those steps happen immediately, like right when they exercise there. And then some of them are delayed six to 24 to 48 hours. If you know a little bit about this physiology, you have a combination of neutrophils and macrophages and a bunch of things happening. And this says a time sequence. So what happens is by the time we get to this 28 to 48 hour window. Now the muscle soreness kicks in, which wait a minute. If I, if this was a result of my muscles being torn, and that happened immediately, wouldn't that pain start immediately? Well, the answer is it would. And so that that is your first clue that that's not responsible for it. When we look at that immune response, and we see that that is actually peak 24 to 48 hours later. And then that's the same time the pain kicked in. That's cooling you into the problem. So we have this immune response happening in inflammation. Then all of a sudden we start getting fluid accumulation. And now there are what are called nosy sectors and you're probably very obviously you're very familiar with these and these are your pain receptors. The very interesting is we don't necessarily know a lot of information about how many pain receptors are in muscle. They're not really in the belly. In fact, this is why I can perform my muscle biopsies and they don't really hurt. You mean in the belly of the muscle. Correct. Yeah. We do have pressure sensors though. And so if you change the volume of the tissue, you will respond to that very, very quickly. So by enhancing swelling in the actual muscle, that is immediately putting pressure on those pressure receptors, if you will. That's the signal. So what's probably happened here and I just I just hate to give you another bone. But a lot of the laid-on muscle sonus is probably just a neural feedback loop, rather than a new exact muscle damage. Makes a lot of sense. There's a lot of interactions between the types of neurons that control touch sensation and pain sensation and itch sensation. In fact, a lot of people kind of collapse itch and pain. Another thing that's painful and itch is a familiar thing for people mosquito bites and such. And of course, there's the classic gate theory of pain which people will be familiar with and then I'll explain why I'm explaining this. Which is if you, you something hurts, you know, you bonker knee or you stub your toe. We tend to grab that body part and try to rub it. Totally. And that rubbing is not a coincidental thing. It activates a set of touch sensors that respond to kind of broad dull touch. And that actively inhibits through the release of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, the fibers that control the pain signal. So any time we rub it, you know, like a Charlie horse or leg or we stub our toe and we, you know, we rinse and then we grab the toe and we kind of like squeezing it a little bit. That's actually deactivating or partially inactivating the pain mechanism. So the idea that a swelling response would then trigger a neural response that then would recruit the pain receptor response. You know, I'm using broad, broad brush strokes here to explain this makes very good sense to me. Now and only now that you've explained how this process works. I can actually even add more to that. So if you remember how muscles work. So we have to have some sort of signal from the nervous system that has to actually go in and tell the muscles to contract. Well, remember there are a few episodes that go we covered the physiology here of what's called the motor unit. Okay, well, what I didn't explain to you are called muscle spindles. And we have talked about proprioception in an episode of before us. Well, but we never tied this picture together. So let me walk you through that really quickly and it's going to tie this loop and endo and ice boat. So what happens is this motor unit is is coming in from what's called an alpha motor unit. And that's going to be innovating your muscle fibers and that's going to tell the muscle fibers to contract. Those are typically spread out throughout the all sides of the muscle in interior exterior. On the outside though, there is another type of muscle called a muscle spindle. Now these are non contractile. So they don't have that act in an aniscent and they don't produce force. They are responsive. They are proprioceptive. So what that means is they sense stretch. And this is why, for example, if you were to stretch a hamstring, a touch any muscle group it doesn't really matter or muscle. It's innate response is to fire back to close that distance. And this is what keeps you from say if you're leaning to the right. You can imagine that the example we give is if you're standing on one foot and you start swaying to the right. All right, let's say you're standing on your right foot and this makes it easier for folks. And you start swaying to the right like you're going to fall on your right ear will hit the ground. The inside of your right calf muscle will start being stretched. So the stretch on the inside of the right calf muscle will sense that stretch. And it will respond by contracting that pulls you back to the middle and stops you from falling. That's proprioception and muscle spindle sends stretch until you to contract. The way they work is through gamma motor neurons. And so these are sensory things. So what's happening is unlike when you tell your muscle that contract it goes alpha to the muscle contract. These muscle spindles works so that it is oh I've been stretched send signal back to some central point typically in this spinal cord. And we don't actually want to go all the way up the brain. We've got a time delay. This is why these are subconscious autonomic right or so. So that gamma is going to go back to the central location and then come back through the alpha motor neurons until it took contract. So you have those wonderful mechanism of sensing stretch going back. Well one theory that's been put forward regarding muscle damage is that the pressure is actually being applied to those nerve endings of the muscle spindles. And that's actually responsible for the pain signal that's going back and coming up to your brain and you're registering that as pain. Rather than it is actually in the contract value and it's so the muscle fibers. That's a very intriguing idea of because it would suggest that stretching muscles in order to alleviate soreness might be the exact incorrect thing to do. Now I'm not saying that for certain I'm just building off the mechanistic logic that we've laid out here. Yeah. Really that you've laid out here. There's the more effective principle based on exactly that which is this is we generally why low level movement is effective at reducing acute soreness because that's low level contraction of the muscles and you're going to stretch and get tissue out and you're going to get fluid out. Wow. You're really pumping it out of the cell. Yes and in our previous episode where we were talking about programming we're using the we but let's be fair here where you were educating us including me. And the audience about different structures for programming exercise for specific adaptations etc. Month week year scale etc. We had a brief discussion about the fact that if one trains legs very hard with resistance training some heavy squatting or deadlifting it. And there's some soreness that oftentimes doing some quite a quite lighter cardio or some low impact work the next day or any number of different things that involve not high intensity. Contractions of the muscles but that do require contractions of the muscles that it can alleviate soreness more quickly than if one were to simply lie around and you know watching it flicks or something. Yeah that's exactly right the. To go back just a little bit as well the if that's really the case the question is like where is this inflammatory signal coming from and while there's much to be learned there there is a little bit of. Information right out suggest it's potentially coming from free radicals released from the mitochondria again that may or may not hold up as more research comes I'm not sure but if you remember back to our conversation on endurance so we talked about the electron transport chain and a roguin metabolism regardless of whether you're not getting energy from glycolysis. Or car behind rates remember they have to be finished through roguin metabolism so even if you're lifting weights. And you're using carbs for your fuel you have got to finish that metabolism by running it into the mitochondria and performing oxygen metabolism as a result of that that electron transport chain runs. So theoretically free radicals which is which are hyper reactive oxygen species basically there are oxygen molecules that are missing an electron so that they react to a lot of things. They're the opposite of antioxidants by the way this is. They oxid molecules with extra proton so they can balance the charge if those leak out that I know itself is going to be a massive inflammatory signal and that's probably what signals the cause of these neutrophils and macrophages and kicks off this entire cascade. Again, I believe we need more research there. I need to look into it maybe it's more definitive than I that I know. But that's probably what's happening potentially what's happening rather that causes that cascade in signal also. What you have is this combination of well if that's the case why am I not getting tremendous amount of muscle damage when I do more aerobic based exercise. Well because you don't have the mechanical tension pulling on the fibers that's actually causing damage to the cell wall that allows these free radicals to escape the mitochondria and the cell wall. So that's the best we can postulate at this moment as to why those things are happening and then why again low level exercise tends to enhance even things like percussion. So using either instruments that put a low level of vibration in your leg or like pneumatic boots so you massage all these things are generally probably helping because they're moving that stuff out. Adema most specifically so pressure comes off of those nerve endings and the muscle spindles. And allows you to stop receiving that signal of pain despite the fact that you didn't actually regenerate tissue at all yet. Fascinating and I think that beautifully frames where we're headed next which is to talk about all the different modes of recovery and how to accelerate them and. Perhaps even how to combine different forms of recovery in order to become better at recovering and in doing so. Make faster progress of fitness before we begin. I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate for Dr. Andy Galpons teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is however part of our desire and efforts to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. Keeping with that theme we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is momentous momentous makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The human lab podcast is proud to be partnering with momentous for several important reasons. First of all as I mentioned their supplements are of extremely high quality second of all. Your supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations. You can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, momentous supplement ship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the human lab podcasts listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the human lab podcast in particular supplements for hormone health for sleep optimization for focus as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery. You can go to live momentous spelled OUS so that's livemomentus.com slash human. Today's episode is also brought to us by element. Element is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium to optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance. Most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best. But what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of ourselves and nerve cells neurons in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios. Now of course, people with pre-hypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake. But what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise and in particular if you're falling a very clean diet, that is not a lot of processed foods, which of course is a good thing. Chances are you're not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. Human contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams, that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar.

Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 sleep. 8 sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've been using an 8 sleep mattress cover for about the last 8 months, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I'm sleeping about the same amount, but I'm sleeping far deeper, and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so-called rapid eye movement or REM sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically. The underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward. I've talked many times before on this podcast in elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep at night, your body needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees in terms of core body temperature and waking up involves a 1 to 3 degree increase in core body temperature. With 8 sleep mattress covers, you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be 1 temperature at the start of the night, a different temperature of the middle of the night, and a different temperature as you approach morning. Each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever. If you'd like to try 8 sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com slash Huberman and check out their pod 3 cover and save $150 at checkout. 8 sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia.

So to kick off this discussion about recovery and with the understanding that recovery is when the specific adaptations exercise actually occur. I'd love for you to share with us what happens or needs to happen during recovery in order for us to get better at anything endurance, strength, etc. But also how specific types of exercise stimuli and specific types of adaptations that we trigger, so running a bit further, lifting a bit more weight, slowing the cadence of a given movement, etc. How those specific types of triggers for adaptation relate to the specific or maybe similar types of recovery that are required for us to make progress. And one of our previous episodes we were talking about how the Harvard fatigue lab really identified this idea of homeostasis, or at least sort of championed it for it. And that's important because in all levels physiology wants to return to homeostasis. So what happens in terms of adaptation is you've challenged it to a level that it realizes if it does not make a change, it will not be able to get back to the same level of homeostasis. That's fundamentally what's happening. That is recovery. That process of taking an insult, being temporarily reduced in functionality, causing a change so that now we come back and get what we often call in support performance, super compensation. All that really is doing though is bringing you to a new level of homeostasis. Effectively, it is understanding if that same insult comes again, I need to be able to make sure that that doesn't cause the same level of disruption. And so we raise the bar, whether this is enhancing our ability to take the same level of mechanical tension on the muscle and not result in micro damage. Whether this is being able to take the same reduction in energy and not have that compromise sleep or anything. It's really fundamentally changing so that we can have a new level of homeostasis because it's presuming, it's predicting that that same insult is going to come again down the road. I wanted to clarify for people that when Dr. Galvin says insult, while he may actually insult me, insult is the nerd speak terminology for some sort of damage inflicted to a tissue or system. So he's speaking about the insult to the muscle or insult to the neuromuscular connection, created by adding more weight to the bar, running a further distance, running a bit faster or pedaling faster. That creates a micro insult or an insult. And now because everyone is familiar with psychological and verbal insults, you'll never forget that biological concept. It's important to be tagged into the other thing here, which is called horror meces. It's one of my favorite phenomena, and it effectively means this that there is a dosage or toxicity response to almost everything. And if you think about this in the context of say drugs, what this means is if I gave you 10 milligrams of something, that it would be okay. But if I gave you 20, it would be a problem. And eventually if I go up and give you enough this thing turns toxic. This is the case of everything from cyanide where it can actually be in small dosages in hatred. In fact, it's in many of the fruits that you eat, but it's at a dosage that it doesn't matter. If that dosage gets higher though, that actually can cause problems. And if it is high enough, it can actually kill you in Centanese. The back end of that though is because you introduce this micro insult, as you framed it for me perfectly, your body will then adapt to it. And that's really what's happening with exercise adaptation. It is a hornmetic stressor. And why that's important is if you look at the immediate responses to exercise, you see an extremely large increase in inflammation. You see oxidative stress. You see a whole cascade of a topology. Like all these problems, quote, unquote, happen. And it's actually quite funny here is as a part of my PhD, the academic portion I had to go through the medical side of the school. And so I was my physiology class was in med school. So I'm the only non medical doctor in that class right in my PhD. So I leave my lab, I walk across campus and I take physiology class with these folks. And I died the whole time internally because every time we would cover a new area, it was basically the exact same value or number. And a medical setting is like, oh my gosh, they're going to die. And in performance setting is like this person's in fantastic shape. I never still amuses me to this day obviously because it's just simple things like total blood volume, right? And you cover like, okay, if you have a patient come in there, blood volume to six liters, you know, I can immediately get them on a diuretic of some sort because they're going to have a heart attack because blood pressure gets up right? And I'm immediately thinking to six liters, that doesn't person is super fit. Because that is actually a positive adaptation to training is one of the most important, if not the most important adaptation to endurance training is enhanced total blood volume. So you'll just do a more blood in your body when you're more fit than you are less fit. So I'm like, I'm going on all these things. Sodium concentrations, potassium concentrations, like you look at these things on paper and you don't know if that person's about to die because they're 65 years old out of shape or if that person's going to break a older record in marathon. This brings up a very important tangent, which is for instance, if you go and take a blood test and you are somebody who exercises very intensely with resistance training. Your blood creatinine levels can be way out of range. And if your physician doesn't know that you're doing certain forms of exercise might say, wow, there's a lot of muscle tissue damage occurring in your body. Yeah. As you mentioned before, your total blood volume is dangerously high. When, in fact, you are far healthier and you'd much fitter than the person who as numbers would be in range. That said, obviously there are limits to these statements whereby you would want to be cautious and take action. And take action to ameliorate a very elevated blood creatinine level or something of that sort. But the one you're bringing up is also one about the field of medicine, which is that many not all, but many physicians don't take into consideration. The outside activities that people are doing and so it becomes a kind of plug-in play type way of looking at blood charts. We've done many thousand athletes, blood chemistry, and we don't use, first of all, we never look at disease stuff as not what we do. We take people that are healthy and try to optimize performance. And blood chemistry is one of the best tools. If you really understand what you're doing there, you can get some incredibly powerful information out of blood chemistry. Would that actually relates to what we're going to talk to today in terms of measuring everything from acute to chronic dehydration to sleep deprivation can be identified in blood chemistry to optimization improvements in nutrition supplementation. There's this a lot you can get there. Maybe people interested in that field, I would point them to gentleman named Dan Garner. There's just an absolute juggernaut in wizard and blood chemistry for high performance. But what you can get a ton of information from that, if you understand the difference between exactly what you talked about, looking for signals of increased risk of cardiovascular events 25 years down the road versus is this the optimal value for high performance and an athlete, which is what our database and all of our software and stuff does is only looking for those things. So I'm going to talk about some of the biomarkers to look for a little bit later, salary, some blood stuff, but we'll maybe say that for the conversation for down the road. Tell me about different time scales of recovery. Sure, this is actually where I was trying to answer your question for and then I got myself a way of track, but the reason I brought up the hermetic thing is, if you understand that some things in the acute say 24 to 40 hour period look terrible, it's actually fine, right? So this is the stimuli that's causing adaptation. So the reason I brought up the medical exchange there is because you if you looked at inflammatory markers and then you mentioned some of them. You would see that they are highest acute within seconds to minutes to hours after exercise. However, that's exactly the stimuli needed to bring them down chronically. Okay, and so chronically meaning maybe in that moment they are elevated and then maybe they're coming down 24 hours later and 48 hours. However, if you were to compare your resting level say that Monday before you worked out. So you're resting level that Monday the week following. We're following that what you would probably see is your baseline inflammation goes down. And so we got to be really careful are we talking immediately post-exercise man these markers are terrible. Maybe my recovery scores are awful. So that's not necessarily a bad thing because what we're looking to do is to not only change what's happening today, but we're trying to cause adaptation that may take us weeks or months to actually access. I love that you're highlighting this principle because one of the more obvious ones to me now that you've said this is heart rate. My heart rate goes very, very high during exercise and I do that fairly consistently. Even semi-consistently my resting heart rate will actually be quite a bit lower. That's a fantastic example. Really what you're getting at here is this concept where I think it's important to differentiate between adaptation and optimization. Now we hear that word and I use it and most scientists hate it but it's a good communication to an optimization. If you're optimizing for the current moment you're almost surely compromising the laid adaptation. If I were to say do the thing right now that makes you feel the absolute best in the world and you're like great. You took a nap and you ate a donut like awesome. You feel amazing. But you know it's causing long-term issues. The same can be said in the back end. If you're never choosing things that make you better right now, you're never actually going to see any adaptation. So what we're really doing with this recovery conversation is playing this game of balancing immediate gratification with the laid gratification. And how do we identify how much to do now versus not? How do I use a value or a marker whether this is how tired I feel today? How sore I am today? Or says a score on a app or a tracking metric, whether this is a blood marker or anything. And understand if that's what I need to cause the adaptation I want a week, a month, three months from now. And in the case of some of our other athletes, it's even up to four years, right? We're trying to cause adaptations that will get us where we want to get in the Olympics or World Championships or World Cup or wherever we're going to be. So that's the framework we have to think about recovery. We maybe falsely think about it is I need to maximize my recovery today. And you could do something like taking anti-inflammatory. Well, this is supplementation or a drug or maybe this is ice. Oh, cool. That's great. That will enhance your recovery in this moment. That'll make you feel better today probably tomorrow. But what we know is that blocks the signal for adaptation. So you're not going to get the same results for six a weeks or no. So when we talk about recovery, we have to understand what tool am I using and why? And in order to do that, we have to understand what am I training for? And what am I trying to maximize? If I am in the middle of a season with an athlete and we are competing tomorrow, I am going to head towards acute recovery. Right? Because I have to actuate that performance right now. If I am starting the off season, I'm not hedging towards recovery. I'm actually hedging towards adaptation. So we're not going to deploy any of these especially things like, there's evidence that a combination of vitamin C and vitamin E will blunt hypertrophic adaptations. Because there are anti-inflammatory, the anti-oxidants, right? Other studies have shown maybe they don't have inhibitory effect. They may or may not. Point is conceptually, you want to be careful of what you're trying to optimize for. And you have to have that forethought and that alone is going to dictate your decision making with whether or not again you get in the eyes. You do that. Now, we will cover some tools like massage that are pretty fine to use. You don't have to worry about those blocking long-term adaptation, but others you want to be very careful about. So this principle that you've laid out for us, which is that there's a set of events that occur during exercise that trigger the adaptation. And that sets in motion a number of adaptations that occur during recovery that then give us the exact opposite response to what the trigger was. So, I'll go back to the heart rate example. Heart rate is close to maximum or maximum. You do that enough times within a week or so or two weeks and your resting heart rate goes down. As I recall a few episodes ago, you said that your maximum heart rate doesn't really change that much. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. But your resting heart rate can go down quite a bit. Is that a general theme meaning do we have a more or less set upper limit or ceiling for things like inflammatory markers for heart rate? Maybe even things like stress and what we do when we deliberately trigger stress or a dramatic increase in heart rate or dramatic increase in inflammatory markers is that we are lowering the floor, but that the ceiling remains the same. It's very dependent upon the marker. So in the case of maximum heart rate, it will not change with the exception of one thing, which is age. Age brings it down. Training will not change it up in most circumstances. If you look at something like an inflammatory response, I suppose theoretically there is a ceiling, though I'm not aware of it. I can tell you right now looking at blood markers of things like creatine kinase. So remember the conversation about metabolism and with that we use a phosphocreatine as one of our primary fuel sources for explosive exercise. Well, if we're using phosphocreatine, this creatine kinase, remember kinase are enzymes that that function to break things down for the most part. So creatine kinase is the enzyme you use to break down creatine. When you do that a lot, then that creatine kinase gets out of muscle and seeps into the blood. Myoglobin is actually another fantastic marker, by the way, myoglobin is, if you think about hemoglobin being in blood, as of the molecule that carries oxygen around, when it's in the muscle tissue, then it's myoglobin, myol meaning muscle and the same globular thing. So there's a bunch of markers you can look at, muscle breakdown. And one of the things that you can see is a creatine kinase level that's elevated after say one body vector size and you might be up, you know, five or sixfold. I've actually seen this number in offensive Lyman and the NFL be something like 500 plus fold. So even within just one category to the next, that number can get extraordinarily high. And if you note, this is actually one important point here. If you're paying attention to any mechanistic researcher, you're using that to inform you decision making, you have to be extraordinarily careful of magnitude. And what I mean by that is, if I were to be running a Western block looking at a signaling protein in a muscle, did this activation of this protein turn on myocondrial biogenesis. And I saw that whatever intervention we gave it, whether it was an attrition thing or a drug or an exercise. And I saw that that signaling protein increased by 20%. I would basically assume that to be totally physiologically irrelevant. Because in order for that to be important, totally depends on the mark you're looking at, but some markers I might need to see four or five, six hundredfold increase before I know that that will actually be enough to be what we call physiologically relevant. Others, if they're up one or two percent, that is relevant. And so you really want to be careful when you're either reading papers or looking at social media stuff, if people are just talking about this marker increased this much, it may not matter. And so you have to, that's also what you're wondering, like how the hell are the other people? Well, that's how they can trick you a little bit. And what intentionally or not, it could be just they're trying to be their best, but they don't really understand that area enough. And so that's an important point to pay attention to. So to answer your question again, fully, it would be hard to determine if there was truly a maximum level. Some things don't want to move like bloodbage. It doesn't really want to move. The range that you're going to move from is, you know, like six point eight to seven point four. And if you get up to like seven point nine, like you're probably in big, big, big trouble. Other things again can go up 500, 5000 fold. And so the markers will really determine that answer. Well, at some point in the future, I'd love to continue this discussion around the topic of stress, specifically. Yeah. And maybe we will get into that a little bit later today when we get into the use of deliberate cold exposure. Because that certainly has effects related directly to temperature on tissue, but it certainly has mental effects in terms of raising ones level perceived pain. Yeah, or some people love it. And some people love it for the feeling they get during it. Deliberate cold exposure. Some people only like it for the feeling that they get after it. Not unlike exercise. I love to train. I love exercise, but I know many people who. They low the exercise, but they love the feeling afterward. So this will be a theme that we'll come back to. Thank you for indulging my interest in that semi tangent. I think it's a relevant tangent if there is such a thing. You can now return us to the different time scales and modes of recovery. I think where we are headed is how to get better at recovery. Yep. Let's talk about the tools. Let's talk about what to measure and identify for all four of these distinct levels. So level one is what we call overload. And just very quickly what that means is I did a workout today. The sign and symptom of overload is your fatigue. A cute performance is down. So I worked out hard right now. If I were to go try to do a maximum effort, I would be reduced in my ability. The recovery period for acute overload is minutes to days. Right. That's generally what we call acute overload. And that's what we're looking for. Right. So we system should theoretically see that hormetics dresser come back and response come back bigger better, more efficient, etc. If you were to continue training in that state, like most of us do and say I did a workout today, I had a little bit of acute overload. Going to work out again tomorrow. A lot of more acute overload. Can work out the next day, a little more acute overload. Even if you took a day in between, that doesn't matter. You just continue these acute bouts of insult. Then you're going to be pushing into the absolute golden target, which is what we call functional overreaching. So you have overreached what you can currently do. And it results in a functional outcome. And what we mean function here is performance is enhanced. And again, performance being whatever you deem it to be your stronger. You've enhanced muscle size, your mitochondria has improved, whatever the thing is, it's not just a physical performance thing, right? Amazing. Recovery time for functional overreaching is typically a few days to maybe even a week or so. And so typically what we see happen is prior to a competition individuals will do what we call a taper, which is a reduced training volume for some short period of time. And the reason they do that is to again, actualize is the phrase we hear is here, the adaptations. So you worked hard for six weeks. And you know, theoretically the workout you did three, four, five, six weeks ago, once you allow the system to recover, will be actualized, which means your performance will be enhanced here. So functional overreaching is the golden target. Okay, if you were to be at the point of functional overreaching, and you continue to train. So it intensified whether this is through intensity, this through volume or really, as you said earlier, you had something holding back your recovery. It doesn't really matter, right? It's sort of two sides at the same point. Then you would move in what we call non functional overreaching. So you've overreached again, but now it is non functional as in you did not see a positive benefit once recovery allowed. This typically means you have weeks. It takes weeks to come back from and you basically just get back to baseline. And this is where a lot of folks are who end up in this vicious cycle. And so you're like, man, I'm not getting the results I want. I'm going to train harder. I'm not getting results I want. I'm going to train harder and harder, but because recovery isn't improved, you just end up in the same spot so then you train more and you end up the same spot and you end up then just, you're blowing up or quitting and you're not getting or you want. If you were to continue past that point, you may actually be in what we actually call over-training. And that typically is considered to be over-trained if it takes months to recover from. So most people think they're over-trained are really not. You're just probably non-functionally overreached. And again, the classic distinction is if you took three or four days off and you felt better, you weren't probably quote unquote over-trained. We were probably just in this area of non-functional reaching. You need a little bit of a back-off. If you and this has been the case of how to sap them with gymnasts and a cheerleader and some other things where they take a month off. And we're barely seeing them start to come back to their baseline numbers. In any number of areas, mood, desire to train testosterone, cortisol ratios, bowel markers in a number of areas, physical performance, vertical jump height like all these things. They just start to get back to baseline. So over-true over-training is actually quite rare. Non-functional overreaching is much more common. And it is a shorter time frame scale. So when we talk about recovery, those are the four pieces that we're really thinking about. And so if you are concerned about, oh, I'm super sore. How do I get less sore? How do I either not be a sore? Next time I do that same workout. Or I'm super sore and now how do I recover. Those are playing in that first category of overload. And we can certainly talk about how to figure that out. But the quick answer is, you got to go back to our previous episodes and just pay attention to the volume intensity recommendations. If you're getting significantly more damage or fatigue in a workout, you probably have increased your volume too quickly. Or something else is dragging your stress bucket down. But generally, this is a problem of training. You either didn't warm up sufficiently, your fueling strategy is off, which we'll talk about in the next episode. Or you've violated one of our principles of increasing intensity and volume. So quickly. If it's past that and you're getting to a stage where you're just like, I'm feeling beat up all the time. My energy is going down. I'm just not feeling like I'm recovered. Now we're in this overreaching stage. So the story I kind of tell here always is a few years ago I was working. And my wife Natasha was in the garage training. And I'm doing something and like she comes stumbling. And she has this look on her eyes and they're like giant her eyeballs are giant. She's like wobbling. She's like, I have to up. And I was like, what do you mean you like, have to up and choose to like, I read the program wrong. And she's like, trying to go, what'd you do? Like she was supposed to be doing 10 sets of three every minute on the minute. And she did three sets of 10 every minute on the minute. And she was absolutely wrecked. She couldn't move for a few hours afterwards. And then for days, she's just like, you have to handle the kids like, I can't get out of bed. I can't move. So that was like a classic example of, all right, like we don't need to fix recovery here. You're just a dummy. And you did the training for way too hard to long. Like this is not we don't have a problem here. So if it's a situation like that is generally you just the program was way off. If it's constantly happening, what you're just like, man, like for whatever reason, every once in a while, I'm getting really sore or having a really bad performance in these workouts. I don't need to go to our other stress bucket. Take a look on our Alastatic load or Alastasis and get figured out what's happening there. So those are the easy ways to flag a cute overload problems.

I'm happy that you pointed out the distinction between functional overreaching, overtraining and being overtrained. One common mistake that people make and think about biology generally is that they think in terms of nouns and adjectives and not verbs. I love that so much. Biology is a collection of processes or processes depending on who you are and where you live and who you trained with. Being overtrained is a state that in many ways is an adjective. You're overtrained. I'm overtrained. It's like saying, you know, I'm an American. I'm a, you know, checklist of hockey and whatever it happens to be, right? And in many ways people do start to associate with an identity, at least a transient identity. And they start making all sorts of decisions. It sounds like about what sorts of verbs they will and will not engage in. Whereas I think if we look at things as processes and we assign verbs to them, then we can say, okay, I'm functionally overreaching or I'm truly overtraining, which is a matter of degrees. Right? Or undertraining for that matter. I'm not, I'm reaching, but I'm not functionally reaching. It's just, it's just performance and it, you know, just as with the nervous system won't change unless you give it a reason to this is the reason why if you can perform something perfectly or speak a language perfectly, there's, there's no rewiring of the nervous system. This myth that we've all been told that every experience requires your nervous system. It's different now than it was two seconds ago. That's, that's a ridiculous, illogical statement. We know that's not true. If your nervous system can perform something, it has no reason to change and it won't. Muscles the same way. This is why you have to progressively overload. You have to learn something new or challenge your muscle to do something new. It's the same thing. So in the example that you gave with your wife doing this workout that turned out to be far more strenuous. She had functionally overreached. In some sense, she might have been overtraining or heading in the direction of overtraining. But the mistake would be to assume that she was overtrained. Right? As a kind of, it's almost becomes a bit of a state or a character assignment as opposed to a verb. In any case, there's no perfect way to describe it. We're talking about nouns and adjectives and we're also talking about verbs. But I think the verbs are really anchored down in processes and things that we do actions that we can take. And so if I may, I'd like to just highlight this idea of shifting one thinking towards verb actions rather than labels on the state that we happen to be in. Or the person that we happen to be, sometimes it even does become kind of character logical in the way that people describe it. And so I have to believe that there is something called overtraining that overtraining is real in other words. But that we don't ever really know if we're overtrained. You nailed it. There's no, it's not like a red flag, you know, shoots up out of your shoulder and it's like a mower train, you know, it's. So in doing so, I hope that we can start thinking about some of the verbs, the actions that we can all take in order to ensure that we stimulate progressive overload one way or another. And at the same time that we don't fall into these bins of character assignment, we're suddenly we decide that we need to do acts like take a month off or something like that. Because I'm beginning to realize from our discussion that that's exactly the wrong way to go. Those are fantastic points. I want to make sure it is clear that there is no clinical diagnosis for overtraining. There are no standards, there's no test or a blood panel, you can pull that would actually identify you in that state. So your your distinction here, Andrew of these are verbs and rather than nouns is is so wonderful because that is exactly the case. The only way we could really come retroactively diagnose one with overtraining is if again we had you did weeks of recovery and you only got back to baseline. So we can't do it in the moment. I can't take a single test. There's no subjective marker and there's as you are overtrained. It is simply you are probably overtraining and we need to reverse that quickly or in the case of the step before. You are probably non-functionally overreaching and if you continue to do this you will probably enter a new stage where this is your overtraining and we need to come back. So that's an important thing to let people know is there's no one thing we can actually point to that says you are here. You are not a noun. This is a verb. So what are some tools that we can use to enhance our recovery? Let's start off with that acute overload phase. In other words, I just did a workout and I'm feeling awful or I just did one two days going on super sore. How do I get rid of that right now? Well there's a couple of things you can do immediately after you workout and then others that are maybe more actionable a day later or two days later. We'll just cover and we'll do some nutrition and hydration and supplementation in the next episode. I'm going to cover everything else not in that category right now. So a couple of things. Number one, you can actually start kickstart that recovery process at the end of your current training session. I guess I should say this way. I strongly suggest you start this recovery process immediately after the workout. You mentioned earlier about this idea of you got to get a really high peak of stress to cause that adaptation. But I actually didn't explain that correctly because what has to happen is you need that extremely high peak, but you then you have to be met with an extremely sharp recovery back down. So you know you've talked about this before in some of your neural plasticity stuff and in terms of what has to happen. That caused the insult and then you immediately need to be able to recover to make sure that that causes changes and the right same thing happens here. So we need a really sharp and high inflammatory response and then if you do not meet it within immediate recovery period. The signal won't be there to maximize your results. So what's that mean? You can actually do a couple of things. Number one is actually listening to slow pace music. There's evidence to suggest fast pace music may slow down your recovery and slow pace would actually enhance it. So if you just change from you know your maximum. Get you up and get going music during the workout to a slower lower cadence that will help you kickstart the idea of a similar note. You can also use what we call down regulation breathing. You could do them in conjunction or one or the other which ever is up to you. So my personal favorite method here is somewhere between three to ten minutes of finishing your training session laying down. I'd like to be in that position you could certainly do it in the lotus position, but I think laying on your back is generally more effective personal preference there are no signs. I like the eyes being covered getting into this dark quiet sort of area. And then just breathing through your nose in a structured cadence. There's a lot of different things you can try an easy example is just box breathing. And you can imagine box having four squares. So what you're going to do is inhale for somewhere between like three to eight seconds. And then whatever number you choose you keep that same tempo. And so let's say you chose to do a five second inhale. That's going to take you up vertically and then horizontally for your box is a five second hold. And then a five second next tail and then a five second hold. And you just need to repeat that for the time domain. I typically honestly don't use a timer. You'll actually notice a lot of people will like fall asleep or get really close to falling asleep in this period. You could do a triangle version of that where you do an inhale hold exhale and then go right back in your inhale or there's a bunch of different tricks you can try here. You need to play around and see what actually works best for you. This is probably better, but if you can just at least give me three that'll work. If you're really, really resistant, you can actually do that just in the shower. And so if you're going to finish your workout, getting the shower again, just close your eyes in the shower, give me three minutes of focused relaxation breathing. And that will accelerate the recovery process. I love it. And I particularly love it because my laboratory works on stress and respiration, okay breathing and the interactions between the two. And I'll just mention a result that was just accepted for publication. So should be out by time this goes. Thank you. This is the beautiful work of not me directly. Although it took place in my lab, but as we know, it's the student of postdocs. I'll really do the heavy lifting of Dr. Malice Balbon in my lab, the phenomenal researcher. That showed that a short period of five minutes of box breathing of exactly the type that you described were cyclic sign. So two inhales followed by an extended exhale to lungs empty. Ideally, the inhales are done through the nose. The exhales are done through the mouth, although it could all be done through the nose. Or the mouth for that matter, but probably nose nose for inhale, inhale mouth for exhale or in inhales through the nose. And an and exhale through the nose. Sick like sign as we refer to it done for five minutes. Both of those produce very significant decreases in resting heart rate. The over time will increase things like heart rate variability and so on and so forth. So provided that there are extended exhales that seems like the calming response and the reduction in overall stress occurs. The only thing that really sends things in the other direction would be something like cyclic hyperventilation. I'm sure you've observed that. And interestingly, when we had people just do five minutes of meditation, which during which, of course, they are breathing. But they're just allowing that breathing to progress. However, it happens to be in that moment. Or moments across the five minutes. There were reductions in the same sorts of markers of stress that I described, but not as significant as breathing. I love the box breathing tool post workout and there's some other alternatives there too. I just mentioned, but I think people greatly underestimate the potency of breathing for shifting ones. Their system function away from stress or if one wants toward more alertness and stress. I actually have a couple questions for you on that. Sure. I think the audience would appreciate this. How long were those boxes? Does it just use your selected? Great question. So we use the carbon dioxide tolerance test. Amazing. In order for people to determine how long the different sides of the box should be. And you cover carbon dioxide tolerance test in a previous episode. Now, we can provide a link to that clip in the show note captions, but as you point out, involves a long extended exhale to lungs empty. And of course, people could sit with lungs empty, but they have to accurately refate. Fairly, as we say, report how long it took them to empty their lungs. We use that as a gauge. Typically, if it takes, if people go to lungs empty in 20 seconds or less, I believe I have to go back to the paper and look. But I believe that the duration for each of the sides of the boxes is it where was somewhere between two and three seconds. If they had a CO2 discard time of anywhere from 20 seconds up to about 40, 45 seconds, we use it at the sides of the box where I believe between four and six seconds. And then for people longer than who could discard their arrow over a period of a minute or more. We use a box duration that is in hellhold, exhale, hold duration of somewhere between, I believe it was seven or maybe it was eight and as long as 11 or 12 seconds. And here kind of free diver types, you can really do this, who are really well trained for this sort of thing. Don't quote me exactly on those numbers, but that was approximate. Those line up exactly with what we've done. So I believe it's going to be close within seconds of non-important distinction is going to be close enough. So that's great. And that was, it took them what six weeks before. So this study was done over the period of a month and then when they were swapped into a new pattern of breathing condition or meditation condition. And this was all done in the natural world, as we say, they were wearing boot bands that we're getting heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep data, subjective data about mood, et cetera. So there were a lot of measures, but this was more than 100 subjects out in the wild of life. And we tried as best we could to track life stress events and exercise and things like that. That was harder to control outside the laboratory. Really all those results speak to exactly what you're describing here, which is that deliberate respiration that involves controlled holds and exhales really has a dramatic and very immediate impact on reducing our levels of stress. Wonderful. I'm not surprised at all with your findings. And what's really interesting about that is you mentioned how the exhalation portion is primarily responsible for the down regulation. And that's actually goes back to our previous endurance conversation, which is that in general at rest at non-altitude increases in CO2 are the primary driver for ventilation. So what that generally means is inhales are associated with an uptick and sympathetic state and exhales are associated with a uptick of person with that ex state. This is generally why folks will do things like exhale and finish that exhale right before they perform a very high precision neurological task. So if you're going to say aim at a target and shoot you're going to exhale fully and then almost always execute that movement at the end of the exhale because that's when you're in your highest parasympathetic state and lowest driver ventilation. I have to say I'm not surprised at all that you guys found that there's actually other data that point to individuals, particularly after endurance training that can get back down to baseline heart rate is going to be correlated with who gets the most actual result of their training. So that if you take a bunch of individuals and put them through an endurance training program and if you measure how quickly they can get back down to baseline after each workout in general those folks that are better at that are going to see greater improvements in performance at the end of your say four or six or eight week training block. So there's a little bit of causation and correlation there that we have to untie but I think it's enough to say hey if you invest these three in your case your your five minutes it's only going to enhance recovery. So we have a likelihood of increasing the results from your training and now we also have additional benefits like being able to transition more appropriately into our next task going to work going to see family whatever the thing is and it's it's a nice close to I asked you to be in a high sympathetic state body and I asked you to perform and to be under stress. Recovery and now we're ready to transition into our next thing so that we don't take that exercise energy if you will into our next task which may or may not want me in a sympathetic drive state. Somebody is sore following a workout either locally sore in a muscle group of group of muscles maybe in the legs or chest or torso maybe their whole body is sore. Sometimes is the case. What are some tools that they can implement in order to accelerate the I want to call moving out of that soreness but it's really as we know the alleviation of the soreness through a bunch of different processes what are the most effective tools to push back on that soreness and dissipate it. Yeah absolutely. First of all it's not lactate. That's a really important thing that we still hear people talk about is you know your sore 24 hours later you got to do this thing to get the lactate out of there. As we talked about in the metabolism. Conversation in episode that that is not the cause of fatigue and it's certainly not the cause of soreness so. Not an actionable tip there but just a pet peeve of mine when I hear people say that I get irritated so we can maybe in that conversation. Strategies tools. Here's what you can do. You can actually wear compression gear that will help a little bit there's a decent amount of evidence suggesting if you just were to you know put some tighter fitting clothes on leisure wear or compression gear if you have it. That can actually prevent a little bit of soreness from occurring so if you're in the case of poor Natasha and you realize you just done way way way too much or you went hung out with your bow hunting friend and you trained way too hard and you realize all my goodness. I'm going to be very sore here you can immediately put on compression gear and where that really for as long as possible. What are some examples of compression gear I've seen people on the plane with those high high socks. I mean anything that you wear compression gear for what you do for exercise so whether these are just you know compression pants and leggings the tight fitting leggings. Whether this is a long sleeve shirt that's like a rash guard you would wear in you know jitsu or surfing or something like that as long as it's tight fitting. It doesn't have to be much more than that you can wear. I suppose you could get the socks would be great but we generally just tell our athletes they put on a long sleeve compression shirts that they would wear for their training and in long compression leggings and that'd be fine. Can people apply these compression. Garb after training and still get some of the positive effects. Yeah I have not seen any evidence to suggest that that would block adaptation that may be the case. I have not aware of those studies if that happens but I certainly know that the information suggests it can hands a little bit of muscle recovery. But ideally one knows if they are about to do a workout that could trigger a lot of soreness. Then wears compression gear of some sort to offset that. And if so. Does it have to be local to the muscle groups that you're working on. The reason I asked about the socks is my understanding the socks that the compression socks people wear on the plane is that it's going to shift the patterns of blood flow not just in the lower legs but all over the body. Yeah you're probably going to want to focus on the actual exercising tissue though actually that's a really good question. I don't know the answer of whether or not you did an upper body workout only wore lower body compression gear if that would actually help. That's a great question. It may have been done. I don't know. But I don't know the answer to that. And general we just tell people like wear the whole thing as much as you can. I actually am not concerned that you're wearing a during your workout. It is something you could put on afterwards or even wear it as a little bit of compression either day. We've actually did a really fun study. I collaborated with Bill Cramer who's. Sports scientists of the year award is the Bill Cramer award. That gives you an indication out of a university of Connecticut as well as with Lee Brown. So two lifetime achievement award winners and we put people on a plane in stores. Connecticut and flew them to Cal State for Lerton. So he crossed country flight and some of them got to wear compression gear during the flight and others did not. And then they landed in California did a training bout put him back on the plane with back the stores and I think they did another training bout when they got back there. There was a lot of data that came out of that paper. But one of the things that was clear is the compression group was effective at handling some of the blood related coagulation and other issues associated with. Long flights and particularly athletic performance. So that's actually sneaky little insider trick that I'll use a lot with people. Particularly with athletes that are traveling is just where that compression gear on the plane. So you talked about that and that sort of sort of, running that study to mind that as another effective strategy. So compression gear in general as well as particularly on a plane. Basically to tighter you can get it the better without obviously making your hands purple and being uncomfortable and things like that. So it doesn't have to be overly tight. Anything will work and probably help. So I'm also doing that personally any time I'm taking a flight like that as much as I can. That's just to feel a little better when I get there. So what are some other methods that we can use to alleviate acute soreness? Well, if we continue down the same theme, which is saying, okay, we use some sort of pressure manipulation to enhance recovery. If compression is one strategy, you can also use things like compression boots or garments and these are nomadic devices that will pump air outside you and compress back to board. There's any number of devices that will do this. You can also use the physical hand. So this would be massage and body work. They're all really working as best we can tell on the same mechanisms, which are effectively moving fluid in and out of the tissue as well as potentially enhancing blood flow. Increasing capitalization and which is going to only get nutrients in and waste products out. So you can kind of pick and choose based upon your budget preferences, availability timing, things like that. So those are all effective strategies. Outside of that really is the next largest category, which is now thermal and so far in this discussion, we've mentioned cold water immersion. And I talked about in the high-purtry section how you would not want to do that immediately post-electricize, which would be getting into cold water or nice bath, if you're trying to grow muscle mass. Having said that, there is good evidence showing that cold water immersion specifically is effective at reducing muscle soreness. So it is a fair consideration and it's a classic example of how there are no free passes and physiology. Nothing is always good or always bad. It's always about what are you willing to give up and versus what you're willing to do get. And the case of like cold water immersion, you may be thinking, yeah, I might blunt some of the hypertrophic adaptations. But if you're in that phase of training where you're actually trying to push more towards optimization in that moment, rather than long-term adaptation, then a ice bath might be a great choice. In addition, if you fall into a scenario like Natasha did, and you realize like, I'm just so unbelievably sore, this might cost me three or four or five or six days of training. It might be worth it for you to accelerate that recovery process by a couple of days so that you don't miss so much training. So it's just a, it's an algorithm, it's an equation. What am I looking for? Again, if I'm in season or trying to compete, or if I have just done way, way, way too much exercise, and I'm really insignificant pain, you would probably be willing to give up some small percentage of eventual muscle growth accuracy single session to get out of pain. So of the cold strategies, cold water immersion is clearly the best approach rather than cold air or some other tactics. So a cold shower is probably not enough here. You really do want to be either in moderately cold. This is maybe 40 to 50 degree water for probably north of 15 minutes, or you can be in sub 40 for as little as maybe five minutes to get some of the fact there. And there's been a number of studies, some sort of summarizing a bunch of that kind of into one rather than going through them point by point. The numbers you just throughout, which I'm assuming are Fahrenheit, seem really cold to me. Right, uncomfortably cold. Absolutely. So I always recommend that people ease into it as a protocol overall that they not immediately go to 35 degree cold water if they've never done it before. But that said, once people are comfortable being uncomfortable because I always answered the question, how cold should it be exactly? Would you agree that it should be very, very cold so much so that you really really want to get out, but that you're able to stay in safely whatever that value happens to be. Absolutely need to be safe. Having said that we have actually in our XBT retreats put dozens if not hundreds of people at this point. And immediately in the sub 35 degree water their first time ever and done in a three minutes multiple rounds and a session so they can handle it. But you don't need to go that crazy if you don't want. You kind of have to play a game. Do you want to be really really cold for a short amount of time or do you want to be like kind of cold for a longer amount of time. Really the only mistake you can make is doing something like 65 degree water which for the most people is not very comfortable and doing you know five or 10 minutes. It's probably not going to be effective. So if you're like man 35 is absolutely crazy and you want to do 55 degree water and there's literature in that area. But it's going to say you need to probably be there somewhere almost really north of 10 minutes and some of it will actually show you need to be in there like well north of 20 to 30 minutes. So for my money I would rather go really really cold and get it down at five minutes but personal preference on this one. You can also make it a little bit easier on yourself. There is not nearly as much evidence but there is some on contrast stuff. So this is when you go cold hot sort of back and forth. There are no really good rules in terms of how much should you go how many rounds, how long and cold, how long and hot. Again there have been a couple of studies but. And obviously those studies use numbers but that doesn't mean those have been tested is see what are optimal which is a very big difference. So you can really just kind of play that by feel. Hot is good for recovery. You just have to be careful because you're going to put more blood flow in the area and so you may walk out of there was some additional cue swelling which is then going to put greater pressure on there. So you have to kind of play with the eye personally really like hot for recovery. I will feel maybe not great in that moment but the next day I tend to feel really really good. In addition, if I wake up the next morning and I'm really really hurting and I'm super stiff a hot bath will help that quite a bit. So you can play with some of those protocols. Can you don't have to do ice. There is absolutely no requirement to do so it is just an option if you're interested. Yeah, the studies of Dr. Susie and a sober. Sure. Yeah. Are not directly aimed at alleviating soreness or recovery. They're more about increasing thermal capacity by a storage of brown out of post tissue not the blood very fat but the stuff around the. The cloud of holes and around the heart that help you generate body heat at rest and metabolism and so on and the numbers there that. She's come up with again have not been tested against all the possible derivations just like with breathing we did five minute sessions but it knows maybe a minute would have been equally effective. We just there are constraints on these sorts of studies. But the values that she's come up with which seemed to be good thresholds for making sure that an adaptation response is triggered by heat and cold is. It ends up being 57 minutes per week total of uncomfortable but safe heat. Yeah, in that case, sauna and that can be all in one session or breaking it up into a couple of sessions on the same day or different days and then 11 minutes per week of cold either in one single session or multiple sessions again one could do more. One could break that up over multiple days or do it all in one day or do it all in one you know an hour in the sauna and 11 minutes in the cold or rice first although that seems a little bit extreme especially for the uninitiated. But those are the numbers that have been studied but as you point out there are not a lot of really thorough studies examining. Different cold protocols according to temperature by time requirements. So there is a bit of subjective feel required to establish a routine. And I would actually say this is another time to re-emphasize something we talked about at the beginning of our conversation which is that pain itself is not a defined outcome. It's heavily influenced by your perception and so if you don't feel like they work for you they won't work if you feel like they work fantastic they do so it's a challenging field to get really objective data on so there's always going to be a little bit of. Subjective nature to some of these things I can tell you anecdotally we've used hot and cold contrast for a long time that leads some love it. So don't care for and everything in between so it's one of those things where. I never mandated. Of course I can't mandate anything for anyone I work with but I'm never you know hey you're interested great you struggling this area you want to try this you did and you liked it great you struggling in this area and you try it didn't love it okay fine. I'm not. We'll find other routes as we will get into there's a lot of ways to enhance recovery. This is only one and it hasn't even really come down to stopping the problem in the first place when we're just treating symptoms. Which is first line of defense but you really need to go back and figure out why it's happening to begin with as a solution these are just different. Again acute symptom management tactics. One final point about deliberate cold exposure I think worth mentioning is one of the reasons the shower is. Effective but not nearly as effective as cold water immersion or immersion and I suck to the neck. Is simply because of the reason you stayed before which is that most showers are not going to get that cold and I can get down you know into the sub 40s. Also. The showers haven't really been studied that much they have but not nearly as much as immersion and people always ask why I just think about the challenges of studying cold water exposure in the shower where you can't really control for. How much of the body is covered whether not the head stays under different size bodies etc. Whereas when people come into a laboratory they can get into a cold water and we know where the neck is. And we can make sure that people's arms and legs are underneath but with cold shower sure you can make everyone face away or toward the shower but it's really tricky and. For all the variations that that we're described that said it would you agree that. If one wants to use deliberate cold exposure that. Cold showers better than nothing and cold immersion in circulating cold water or ice bath is better than then cold shower. Yeah, what I would actually say if you're looking for recovery for muscle soreness I would say cold shower is probably doing very little because you're not going to be able to get enough cold water onto any muscle besides basically your head. So maybe you could try and cold bath. And so you at least get some surface area coverage. But yeah if you want to use cold shower for all the other awesome reasons to cold shower that's totally great but if you're trying to use that to recover your low back and glutes from being sore from training. And a good way it's probably not going to do much that the immersion would be there you actually also hit a sneaky other point which is if you can't get your water super cold just make the water move. So if you have jets and stuff you can turn on a new one is try this and if you're like okay I can do a 40 degree bath awesome. Try 60 when the water's moving right because you break up the thermal layer normally you have a little thin layer water that you're heating up you break that up. It's a whole new world. Yeah absolutely so being very still in the cold water is actually the weaker way to go. Correct. That you can make your face stoic but make your body circulate some water around you as long as we're on this maybe just one more point about heat. I've certainly used sauna wet sauna dry sauna steam sauna. Excuse me jacuzzi's can work pretty well. Males if you are looking to conceive in the 60 days following a saw following sauna or hot tub do realize that it that both those approaches do severely limit the number of motiles sperm substantially so for people that are not trying to conceive don't think that this works reliably enough that you could use as a form of contraception. But for people that are trying to conceive it really is detrimental to sperm health right and so for that reason some people bring an ice pack and put it on the groin or near the groin. When they go in but which is hard to do in a hot tub then a sauna so here we're getting into the fine points or crude points if you will pun intended but but the idea is that we we wouldn't want anyone to approach these techniques and compromise their other life goals. I was not allowed anywhere near these things when we were at that stage of life I'll just say that not to put an x-nane me hanging out layered. So yeah, in the sauna for those reasons she's like you're not going in you're not going to none of this stuff and I decide the way. Right heat and sperm have a relationship but it's not one that's positive for the sperm. I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker. Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there however is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors etc. But you don't know what to do with that information. Inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are of course, but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can visit inside tracker.com slash human to get 20% off any of inside tracker's plans. Again, that's inside tracker.com slash human to get 20% off. Are there ways to combine the various types of stimuli that you described for inducing recovery? You talked about breathing-based tools, which while they could adjust and indeed do adjust oxygen and carbon dioxide ratios etc. I'm guessing the major effect of those on recovery is going to be neural. It's going to be deliberate calming of the nervous system, more sympathetic based. It's obviously mentioned. Yeah, most definitely. And then you talked about some movement-based and touch-based approaches, which will movement-circuitly, certainly will circulate blood, but also will generate contractions of the muscles, which may be if indeed, against all specularity, if indeed some of the soreness is due to excessive stretch or swelling at the stretch ends of the muscles. That would make sense. So movement and touch and then thermal are there ways to combine these that are more effective or maybe even synergistic? Yeah, I suppose you could throw on some compression garment, put on a pneumatic compression device and sit in the sauna while you're down regulate your breath. That would be fine. Quite honestly though, you probably don't need to maximize all of them. We were joking. You could probably go for a light swim while regulating your breathing and cold water. You get the compression from the cold water and you'd be in a good spot. So you can certainly do that. The reality is I generally look for some physical approach and then some holistic approach of the breath work basically. The breath and then something else. If you knock those two things out, you're in a good spot. So that could be breath while you're in thermal stress. So just controlling and doing the on-rowing relationship. You have to also remember ice is a stressor. I'll actually show you some data here in a second about how that actually can enhance systemic recovery. So it won't happen in the in the acute minutes. In fact, it's going to take at least 30 to 60 minutes and then you'll eventually see a rebound effect. But acute Lee is going to make you actually more sympathetic, which is going to be a good direction. Heat can do the opposite or it can actually drive you up. So it's a little bit dependent upon how you respond what time of day and how you're using. So in general, I guess defining them is if you need it, depending on what you have, what's available. So perhaps you don't have a sauna, but you can take a hot bath. Great. Maybe you have some percussion device, some tool. And you can use that, but you don't have a sauna. Amazing. I don't have ice bath, they sing. So I think rather than thinking about an optimal combination of them, I would say just use a couple of the tactics based on what you have. And what is easily available in your situation. I'd love for you to teach us about some of the methods for longer form recovery as it relates to overreaching and overtraining. Sure. You want to think about this in a couple of phases. Phase one is to try to prevent it from happening in the first place. In terms of training load, you're going to just go back to our previous episodes where we talk, give you specific instructions for how much to increase your volume and intensity, you probably could set. The other thing you can do then is do some monitoring and go over some different tools, some cost-free ones as well as some higher technologically demanding ones. To monitor to see if it's actually happening. And then the third approach here is what if this is already occurred. I figured out how do I get back out of that whole. So I would like to just sort of tackle these one by one in order and talk about what's happening, what tools you can use and why they're going to work. So anytime we're talking about fatigue management here, most people are aware of these terms because if you have any sort of technology, you're probably getting some sort of readiness score or recovery score or strain depending on which app or watch or tech you have, you have a little bit of an accurate change. If you're in the sport performance world, you might be looking at things again like load or a GPS tracking and monitoring. And really all of it is doing the same thing. It's trying to either one predict a problem is going to happen in the future and then placing restrictions upon you so that you don't run into that situation. The other thing is to be doing is identifying a drop in physiology or performance and then saying we need to get you out of this whole. That's really what's happening. We think of the first one, just imagine a scenario like a mileage limitation, a pitch count and baseball. And what has happened there is, you know, individuals, those fields have looked and said, hey, what we notice is people who throw say more than a hundred pitches in a game. Ten minutes are losing effectiveness and increase injury rate. Therefore, we're predicting the next time you go to play. If you cross that threshold, we start having an increased risk of negative consequences. So therefore, we're going to cap your, in this case, pitching volume at that hundred pitches per game or whatever the case. Same thing with running, it's accurate, et cetera. So you can simply do that and there's actually really cool data coming out now on support performance stuff looking at things like I am using GPS trackers and trying to identify even position by position specific recommendations for how much distance you should try to cover in a practice and a training session. So that you can say, hey, these positions don't cross this threshold, these positions don't cross this threshold, this threshold and basketball and tennis and all kinds of things like that. That's not probably extremely applicable to many of the listeners right now, but it is still conveying the idea that if we understand where we break, then we can stop ourselves from getting there in the first place. The functional example here is just thinking about basic things like where do I start my training program and then how do I progress it and we've already covered those numbers. In either case though, you want to have three markers that you're paying attention to. If you're concerned you're getting into an overreaching phase or potentially going to lead to over training or you want to get out is three unique things. Number one. We're going to look for some sort of performance metric right so this could be your times are going down. Your squat numbers, your your power is going down any of these things so it's got to be an actual performance. Number two. Some sort of physiology and so I want to see something happening with resting heart rate some biomarkers moving heart rate variability some other measure that is not influenced by you. And the beauty of using biological markers are if we can trash that to like performance and I said okay here's our performance test everyday you come in you're going to do a vertical jump. And if one day you come in also in your vertical jump is super low I might think oh man maybe we're starting to overreach. You also could be feeling lazy that day and just not of jump very high on purpose because you didn't want to work out. The beauty of biomarkers are you don't get to manipulate them like that they don't care there's a downside to it which is maybe they're just indirect markers right and so. I'm not telling you biological markers are better than performance markers what I'm saying is you want to look at both. In fact you want to look at our third category as well. Which is some sort of symptomology and so am I I'm having a symptom of overreaching. Am I seeing a performance segment and am I seeing a biological marker as well if you see all three of these popping up you have reason to believe you've reached some overreaching. Now what you have not identified yet is if that is functional overreaching. Non functional overreaching are true over training and remember you shouldn't be feeling great after every training session you're trying to cause that adaptation and until you back off maybe even weeks or months later. I'm going to visualize the adaptation and get that super compensation and performance increase you're going to have to invest a little bit so you're going to go in the whole. Any sport performance coach is going to look at numbers throughout the year and say yeah when we first start training and preparation for this season. We are going to see a drop in performance that day that week that's part of the plan that right that's this stress you're trying to accumulate so. You want to see all three of those markers you just want to pay attention to a couple of things how long are they down for a day three days seven days 15 days etc. If you're seeing a performance drop in a day and I am far away from from performance so the day that I want to peak for. I'm not going to do anything different if I see two days in a row drop performance. I'm not worried if I see more than probably in my opinion five days in a row of decrement then I might start paying attention. If you're in season though or close to competition or whatever that thing means to you. And you see more than a couple of days in a row of dropping then you might actually want to take some. Steps to mitigate that so it really is important you understand again what are we trying to do or we trying to cause adaptation or trying to. Cause adaptation and I have a very specific example of all this we can run through here in a second and then of course a bunch of tools to. The poll you out of those phases but that's that's fundamentally what we're trying to do here I would encourage you again. Don't be too reactive response of to any one measure. I cover a whole bunch of them in a second but you can get lost in in different things because they all have pros and cons and so. I know it's simple to just look at one score in your watch and make your decisions because of that or check your app but you really want to be careful of doing that you're going to probably lead yourself in the wrong direction more often than you're going to help yourself. I'm curious as to why when we over reach too much or too often or we are over training. That performance is diminished because on the face of it it's kind of obvious you're over reaching you're over training so performance is diminished but that's completely circular. You hear about things like adrenal fatigue and adrenal burnout well it turns out adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. There is such a thing as adrenal insufficiency syndrome but of course. These phases like burnout adrenal burnout over training. They're thrown around as much as words like gas lighting and obsessive compulsive you know are without any real clinical definition or there are clinical definitions but people aren't obeying them when they use the language. You want to acknowledge however what is absolutely true which is that over reaching too much too often. Over training these can degrade performance. But mechanistically speaking what's going on because I think once we understand what's going on mechanistically then I think. We can all look at tools whether or not it's breathing movement compression thermal psychological motivational etc. and having much clearer sense as to what's going to work best and what likely won't work. I love this question so much because as I mentioned at the beginning I was fortunate to spend my some microjure work in Andy Freys lab at the University of Memphis and we did a lot in this area and so we. I think this is how I learned how to do assays and run Western blots and measure signaling proteins and things like this so this stuff isn't the end here to my heart. We also did a bunch of really wild studies and he had done some before I got there so. I'm going to combine kind of Andy Freys and tire career and just highlight some of the big pictures of what he found there. He was very interested in exercise particularly strength training and trying to figure out this entire question right which is like why is this actually happening when I work out too much when I live too much. That all of a sudden I can't sleep. What's happening like why is my energy down why is my mood my motivation reduced if I squat too much. So we did a whole series of studies across this career and again I'll just sort of highlight some of the. Some of the themes that ran through them so the first one that jumps out to mine is really in this career into this really awesome protocol. More he had people squat 100% of their backsquat max every day for two weeks. So you come and I think this first one was on a machine and you did a one-rout max and you came back in every single day for two weeks so these are what we would. Generally call kind of like that short to moderate range over reaching and by definition some of them in the fact that being true over training because it would take the individuals sometimes two to up to eight weeks to return back to their one-rout max. I think these protocols. So some of them were non functional over reaching or some combination of that. Well along with that he took a lot of blood samples as well as muscle biopsies to try to look at what's happening. And you're chronologically. neurologically muscle physiology wise to pay attention to what's happened. So a couple of things that jump out there. One of his initial studies actually I think the very first one he did when they ran that first. Squat every day protocol. What they found is kind of called the mean levels change quite significantly and depending on kind of what you wanted to pay attention to there whether it was up and out from an or up and out from. Or even some other markers they basically. Increased by somewhere between two to threefold and so a little bit of understanding of sleep physiology if adrenaline is extremely high. But not for you're going to have a hard time sleeping so that alone was was first indication this is like wait a minute. Something's actually happening here that's just beyond muscle soreness. There's some sort of systemic fatigue happening and as you rightfully pointed out is not the adrenal glands becoming fatigued. That's sort of a bit of tongue and she could pedantic. It is cortisol dysregulation and general stress syndrome. But it's really can be noted in blood in terms of up and effort and nor up and effort. Another study he had done of a similar realm was over the course of seven half days of people came in and did 15 training sessions. So it was really cool. These are these really short balsuit just ridiculous training and they said okay. Like something's happening with with up and effort and a nor up and effort. Something's happening with testosterone. What's it look like inside this cell? So now muscle biopsy came on board and they started looking at things like map kinases, which are these signaling proteins that are tend to be associated with an animal like response. They operateulate muscle protein synthesis and they do many other things but that's like a big factor of them. They looked at various antigens and glucocortocortocort receptors and they wanted to say like well maybe receptor density or endore sensitivity is changing. And in fact, surprise surprise. That's exactly what they found. So they found both antigens and glucocortocortocortocortocortocortocortocort cierto. And so you can start to see a picture forming, which is like hmm, very similar to the insulin type 2 diabetes story where you, you've really put yourself in a very high stress situation. So presumably, aponephyrne, et cetera testosterone releases are extremely high. In response to that to try to reach back to some level of homeostasis, you start down regulating the receptors for them. And so it's like the signal can only get so high. If you're going to keep that gas on, we're going to pull back the throttle on the receptors so that the total signal stays the same if that makes a little bit sense. Well, that becomes obviously problematic. So then like a final follow up study here that is important to notice. They did another protocol, which was really, really cool. And they said the first ones weren't enough. So how about this? We're going to come in every day for two weeks and we're going to do 10 sets of a 1 rep max every day. So they were coming in and they would do 10 1 rep maxes every day for two weeks. And what's really cool about that study? If they didn't complete any other repetitions, they had to repeat it until they had 10 successful 1 rep maxes on that given day. Absolutely brutal, brutal protocol. I wasn't there at the time. They had finished that right before I got on campus. But I was actually able to be around when they were doing some of the final analysis there at the tissue. What they want to look at in this particular study was beta adrenergic receptors, which are those receptors that are going to be eponephyrne, et cetera, going to be binding for. So again, similar story here. Perhaps, are we losing overall sensitivity because of this extreme sympathetic stimulation? I'll actually thinking back what would have been pretty cool is that they had another group that did it. And did some downregulation breathing, opposed to see if they had a million rate. Some of the problems, but of course this was 20 plus years ago or something like that. So a couple of things that happened is the 1 rep maxes dropped by, I think around like 8 kilos, but the end of the 2 weeks. If I remember right, like the group average was something in the neighborhood of 151 kilos. So these were pretty well trained individuals. And it went from, oh, rather, I think actually it was about 160 kilos and they dropped to like 152 kilos. This is something close to that. What was more is significant though, was their power dropped by 35%. Which is really, really interesting because if you pay attention to declines in physical performance over time and I mean that like through aging, what you'll see is people can hold on to muscle mass pretty well. It will go down to by about 1% or so after the age of 40. However, strength will go down at like 2 to 4% and then power by 8 to 10%. And if you look at actually road records across strength sports by 8, you'll see that they will decline by age, but not that much. However, if you look at speed sports by age, they fall off the planet. So it's very challenging to preserve fast through time, whether this is fatigue or because of age. That's really important because that'll then tell you hey, a little bit of a canary in the coal mine is not necessarily your strength, but your speed. And so a lot of different techniques that we use to measure performance, remember that's our triad, right? Symptomology, physiology, performance. You're generally better looking at speed based performance tests rather than strength, based performance tests to get an earlier indication of potential overreaching or overtraining. So anyways, back to the individual study there. In that same group, again, we have the same problem where it took some of them 2 to 8 weeks to come back. So what they had to do is I can remember the exact time frame I probably should have thought through this, but they had to come back something like every week or every couple of days even after the study finished and till they got back to their baseline one rep max. And some of them had took them up to 8 weeks before they finally got back. So they probably were an a classic overtraining state of that place, which was done in as little as two weeks. And this is also another point that people always ask like, how long does it take? Is this something that has to happen over the course of months? So or if I were to go do two days or this intense training camp for two or three weeks, could I actually cause or a training? And the answer is if it is actually truly enough volume and enough intensity, you probably can do some significant damage in as little as two weeks. Probably doesn't happen that often. Most likely you're probably going to be reaching a state of non-functional overreaching, but you may actually be able to put yourself in a position where it might take three or four weeks or more to get back to baseline after a true the intense. And again, think about this protocol. It's like totally unrealistic for the most part. 10 sets of one of a one-rept max squat every day for two straight weeks. Some folks, if you're extremely highly trained weightlifting, you might do something like that when you're very close to say, we're on championships, but outside of that really specific scenario, it's a totally absurd training protocol. But that was the point. We were trying to ensure that overtraining was met. Or close. It's similar to when we've done, we've actually, I think, three studies in the Center for Sports Performance on Dom's muscle sornus. And in all those cases, you do this ridiculous extension protocols, because you're just trying to ensure you cause super sornus. If you don't, then you have nothing to study. Observe training protocols, but that's the point. So nonetheless, as a result, sure enough, the beta-agenerative receptors were down-regulated by something like 37%. What's probably even more significant though was the sensitivity in those receptors was reduced by two and a half fold. And so it's like, okay, wait a minute, we're becoming desensitized this time, and we're all actually starting to reduce our total concentration. Similar, which is actually an interesting, it was a very sneaky smart thing to do, is they looked at an internal urinary up in Ephraim, and guess what? That was also up by like 50%. And so, in 155. 50. Yeah. And so now you're seeing this tie in, where it's like, I'm seeing response at the tissue level. I'm seeing a response probably, although they didn't actually look at the pituitary, like that. I'm seeing a adrenal and other endocological problems. And then I'm also seeing this increase in concentration of that, but in Ephraim, when I'm supposed to be sleeping, and surprise, surprise, I'm having a hard time sleeping, and I'm symptomology. But that's a very interesting finding about an nocturnal epinephrine. Epinephrine, of course, is adrenaline. It's released from the adrenals, those surprise there, but also from the spray area called Locus Surrulius. Yeah. And the brand, and the brand tends to be called epinephrine in the body, adrenaline, just to complicate everyone's understanding. But that, no one's going to claim you did not come from us, so don't blame us. The point is that, rapid eye movement, sleep, so called REM sleep, is more abundant than the second half of the night. We know that the dreams associated with rapid eye movement, sleep, are more emotionally laden, and that those dreams and those emotional states are actually important for discarding the emotional load of previous days' experiences. It's a sort of a natural trauma therapy, if you will, because in the normal healthy state, those dreams are associated with an inability to release epinephrine at night. So for me, what you just described, first of all, it's the first time I've ever heard of it, but it ties together something really quite clear from the sleep neuroscience literature, which is that when people are stressed, they tend to get less rapid eye movement sleep. That rapid eye movement sleep, normally is associated with low levels of epinephrine, so whether or not it's causal or not, isn't clear. But sort of doesn't matter for sake of this discussion, but what I'm wondering, and I suppose, could test for, but maybe observed, is whether or not people who are over training too much, over reaching too much, because of this elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether or not their emotional state is also disrupted, because one thing we know for sure is if you want to disrupt somebody's emotional state, you deprive them of sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep in particular. The one caveat to that is for those of you out there that have heard that rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, deliberate rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, is a treatment for depression that is true, but it's coupled with a next night enhanced rapid eye movement sleep. So one of the major takeaways from all of this that I'm realizing is that no surprise, daytime activities, impact nighttime, and the time-endocrine function, impact quality of sleep, impact daytime activities. Yeah, actually, there's so many fun things I want to do here now. This is actually why measuring eye movement is a very fantastic tool for understanding total stress load, and you can actually differentiate different types of stress, so caffeine use versus alcohol use versus sleep deprivation, by actually measuring eye movements. That's actually what we do in our absolute rest sleep company, is in addition to getting a full PSD sleep study done in your bedroom, you're going to get an eye tracking assessment, which we're going to be able to figure out why you're getting there. So nonetheless, yeah, if you actually look at the classic signs and symptoms of overtraining or overtraining syndrome, it's going to be everything from performance documents, like we talked about, heart-resting heart rate is going to increase, you're going to see things like HRV drop by generally 20 or so percent, that would be a very large disruption in HRV, decreased body weight, and then all the stuff under you just talked about. So motivation and hearings, appetite, mood, all of this stuff are classically known associations with overtraining, and that's further exact reasons you're talking about, sleep disturbances and disruptions, wanting to train motivation, all of this stuff goes part and parcel with non-functional overreaching and or overtraining. You can actually tie this back in a little bit more to some other biomarkers, and this is great because this is stuff we look for. This is the physiology stuff we look for. You've probably talked about SHBG before, which is the sex hormone binding globular. So it's this protein that will float in your body. That's going to bind up sex hormones, in particular testosterone. So what happens with overtraining is that you can actually take this really, like week by week, and you can actually see this number rise. And so if you see this, like say you're using a service like inside tracker, and you're getting your blood measured every so often, and you see this number start ticking up. This is actually associated with that because it's actually happening, it's binding up all your free testosterone. And that's this leading back to the circle we're talking about. And you've actually seen the same thing happen with calorie restriction, just not even after calories, but in this particular case, because it actually happens in both scenarios, you know it's not an issue simply of being undercalorie. It's clearly an issue of the training load being too high. So just to give another little tool, I can get the link for it, but there's a website that was created by, which journal, I'll get it to you, you can link it up, where you can actually go in and plug in a number of values from blood chemistry. So if you got your blood work done, and you can plug in your pre-number and your post number. So say you got it done, and then maybe 10 weeks later, you got it done again, and you're wondering, and you notice, hey, my free testosterone's down, or my SHBG is up. Is it actually a meaningful number? And it will actually tell you whether or not the change, pre-deposed is physiologically meaningful or not, or just within the error margin of the measure. And you can actually change, like right there on the website, you can change your confidence interval. So it's really, really cool if you just have your own blood, and you want to know, like, hey, I had any level this year, and now it's, you know, here over there, it's totally free resource, created, gone through peer review, all that stuff, and I'll give you the link to that. So that's a pretty cool measure. In addition to that, like probably one of the more powerful and easy metrics biologically is to take your cortisol and DHA ratio. So this is known to be associated with a lot of things. You want to be really careful, you don't want this number to be too high, or too low, something like 0.09, it is about to court as all to DHA. DHA to cortisol ratio, yeah. DHA to cortisol, I'd love to tell you I said it backwards on purpose, just to make sure everyone understood, but I got it backwards. Yeah, I mean, this ratio has been associated with so many things. You have to do, you do have to be careful with association, right, not being causation, but everything from risk of infections, the metabolic health, and, like, other disease states, as well as more what we're talking about, which is, hey, am I getting sort of cortisol to this regulation, which is what a lot of folks would call, again, adrenal fatigue, that's not really what's happening, but if adrenaline and epinephran are off and testosterone, cortisol is going to be along the right. And so you can also look at things like testosterone to cortisol ratios. So there's a lot of things you can glean here to give you some insights and where you're going. If that ratio is too high, that's going to be associated with metabolic syndrome and a bunch of other stuff. If it's too low, that's going to be associated with a lot of cognitive problems like aggression and mood and a bunch of things like that. So again, you want to keep it right around that 0.09 ratio. And most of the time actually in some blood chemistry stuff, you'll get a, you get a report of that or you can calculate it pretty quickly. I'm sure we'll get into this in the episode that comes next on nutrition and supplementation. Totally. What about compounds that lower cortisol such as ashwaganda? I can see now based on the logic you're spelling out that during phases of a lot of intense overreaching or frequent overreaching, given that those compounds can indeed lower cortisol, redolia, redolia, rosacea, rotiola, rotiola, rosacea, fun word to say, two words, but the first one more fun to say, rotiola, rotiola, rosacea, rotiola, rosacea, folks. And ashwaganda, I've been trying rotiola recently. And mainly as a buffer to output, it does seem to have some good data attached to it related to lowering one's perceived threshold of how hard they're working. So in other words, you can work harder and not feel as if you're working really hard, which allows you to do more work. That's sort of the subjective description of how it works, but you told me that it can blunt cortisol and ashwaganda, we know blunt cortisol, both of these things, of course, can do other things, but are these compounds that you sometimes will incorporate into a training regimen? I've been using rotiola for probably six or more years, like pretty consistent, not personally, but using it with the individual we work with. You do need to be a little bit careful. I wouldn't say that it blunt cortisol. It is probably more appropriately described as a cortisol modulator, which means sort of if it gets too high or too low, it'll help kind of keep it with an normative range. There's also, there is important to note, there have been a handful of studies, it's two of, I know specifically, showed that rotiola use is going to enhance strength gains, however it may reduce muscular endurance. We need more human data on this stuff, and it may turn out that's not a concern, it may also turn out to be a concern. Nothing is perfect and free. There's no supplement that is a panacea. I have used, again, really, in a lot of situations, because the thing you kind of have to pay attention with cortisol is it's supposed to be modulated throughout the day. It's not supposed to be this normal now. In fact, if you look at normative values, it's typically described in micrograms per deciliter, and depending on literally what company used to draw your blood, if you're getting it through the blood, depending on what method they used, analyze it, the normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly all over the place. They're mostly going to be, like, five to 25, as a quote unquote normative value, but that's outrageous. We also know, those numbers vary massively by age, by sex, and throughout the day. And so if you only are taking a single point, this is assuming you're doing a fasted blood draw, which is what most folks do. It's really only going to tell you a lot about what's happening in that moment. We need to know, well, like, maybe, let's say my cortisol is, if I'm, say, 38 year old woman, and my 7 am cortisol was, you know, 15 milligrams per deciliter. That's pretty good. But if it's 15 milligrams per deciliter at 3 p.m., oh, boy, I'm, I'm probably having some issues, right? So there's a change throughout the day, and you need to be able to plot that curve. So you can actually, well, pretty standard practice that we do is we look at cortisol throughout the day. We're going to take multiple markers, because I don't want to just see your baseline cortisol. I want to see this curve throughout the day. That's going to tell me a ton about, again, as you're sleeping caused by this regulation, is it your training is something else. So I would take a single baseline blood marker of cortisol with a lot of grain of salt. We would typically measure at least three times throughout the day, so something like 6 to 9 a.m., 12 to 3, and then something like closer to the evening. Oftentimes we do much more. We'll do like 7 points or something like that throughout the day depending on the situation. So you want to be careful of that. Distance we're here. You can also get cortisol in through saliva. And now that's sort of pros and cons of that because the pro of doing it in your blood is it's much more stable. So saliva is extremely responsive to whatever happened these seconds before you took that test. The upside of it though is you can do a bunch of real-world life experiments. So for example, we will do this sometimes if we want to see how an individual is responding to a given stressor. Let's take it, right? Let's take it. We're going to go do this workout or this cold exposure or whatever we're going to do, take it at the end. We know that it's responsive to what just happened, but that's the point. So you can act as there's sort of pros and cons. So you'll use the appropriate measure for the appropriate question you're trying to answer. A couple of points and reflections about cortisol. My first laboratory duty as an undergraduate was in a biosecology lab at the time they didn't have the field of neuroscience. It's called biosecology or psychobiology. I didn't know that. There was use of neurochemistry and neurobiology. They had all collapsed into what we got now called neuroscience, which was only some years ago. But my job was to collect cortisol samples, which means I was collecting spit, which means I was collecting saliva. An advantage of saliva based cortisol, it's free cortisol. It's the active form. As you mentioned, it's reflective of what happened in the second or minute, just prior. A couple of things about the regular cortisol pattern across the day because I realized that while it would be wonderful for everybody to get their cortisol measured in detail multiple times and blood and saliva and so on, some people just won't do that for whatever reason or can't do that. The basic contour of a healthy pattern of cortisol secretion is to have highest levels of cortisol in the morning is actually part of the mechanism that's associated with waking you up. Viewing bright light ideally from sunlight, but other forms of bright light early in the day, actually can lead to a 50% or 5,0% increase in that cortisol spike, which is a good thing. People who elevated cortisol, oh no. It does set in motion a cascade of things related to enhanced mood and alertness and immune system function, et cetera. What I think it can be useful for people to understand is that many things will spike cortisol throughout the day, stress, cold water, exercise, but the idea is that it comes down to baseline or near baseline rather quickly. One of the worst situations, as you pointed out, is when the highest level of cortisol is consistently shifted to the afternoon period. In fact, that's a pretty reliable signature of certain forms of depression. This is worked by my colleague David Spiegel at Stanford Psychiatry and the great Bob Seppolsky, Robert Seppolsky of Wisey-Rosdonk Adolcers, and behave, et cetera, and fame. Lots of popular books there. I think that if people are trying to regulate their cortisol and they just understand that base at contour, that the baseline should be rise pretty quickly after one rises in the morning. It's easy to remember, rise rise. Rise out of bed and rise cortisol with light, bright light with exercise, with caffeine. These things will all increase cortisol. Then across the day, it's normal for cortisol to spike. But then to use some of the down regulation methods that you described in particular the breathing methods. And exercise itself is the case may be. But then to really pay attention to how much psychological and physical stress is occurring in the six hours or so, or eight hours prior to sleep. Does that seem like a good to a broad contour of how to have a healthy pattern of cortisol release? Because you actually want the cortisol to reduce inflammation and initiate or participate in the recovery process. You will not see any progress from exercise training without a large spike in cortisol. It is critically important when we think of phrases like cortisol and inflammation stress. This is not bad. Physiology is not personified. Things don't like heat you in the body. It is not good and bad. The more you try to suppress cortisol, the more you suppress that adaptation. What you want is exactly what you mentioned. Large spikes met with large quick recovery. And you want to do that throughout the day and get that or met extra stressors. So, going back to your ashwaganda and rodeo the issue. I think we would be very short-sighted for people to do that as this is a prophylactic. Because if you blunt cortisol, you're going to cause immunosuppressant. Especially early in the day. Taking ashwaganda before going to train is counterproductive. We do not just, this is not a baseline part of our foundational package. If you go look at the athlete foundations or the athlete resilience protocols put together, you're not going to see these things in a specific reason. Any form of cortisol regulation needs to be done strategically. If you are excessively high and we're bringing you back down to normal values at the right time, then great. If you're normal though, then taking you down lower than that is actually problematic. The same thing is actually true since we're here for oxidative stress. For information, antioxidant use. We mentioned I think earlier about taking vitamin C and vitamin E post-stactress and vitamin E post-stactress. It's really a potential to do so. Same thing. If you're modulating this response just because and you have not done so because of actually biological testing that indicated you need to do so, then you're actually making things worse. We see this constantly with people who take a number of supplements and substances for sleep and then they wake up the next morning grungy. And your cortisol suppressed. Great. So then they take something for stimulation and then the rest of the day they're trying to reduce and then they're going to just nasty cycle. Instead of just getting out of the way and letting cortisol do what it's supposed to do. And then making sure again you're teaching it. So this is actually a coachable response. You can coach your own body to go down in the later part of the day and go up in the earlier part of the day. You want to make sure that you are driving that train with intent. And so again to reiterate, if you don't need that, you shouldn't do it. Right? If you don't need to lower cortisol, you shouldn't walk around doing it. You're just going to suppress the state even far. And this is what's needed. This is needed for anabolic response. So you're not going to grow muscle. The cortisol is not spike. It's going to compromise it, rather. So you want to be intentional with these practices, especially in the form of supplementation. Be very, very intentional. I've heard it said that carbohydrates in particular, start to eat carbohydrates. That's why. Can inhibit cortisol. Definitely. And this could be through the tripped-to-fan amino acid related pathway that ratchets up to serotonin release, probably some other things to. I mean, the idea that carbohydrates just stimulate serotonin is a little bit overly sympathetic. No, there's something that recognizes them. Ampicate going up and immediately turning it on there. Yeah. Right. So, you know, I think we've all experienced this. You know, we're stressed, we're stressed. We, doesn't necessarily even have to be highly processed. You know, fat-a-sos, you know, fatty carbohydrates. You know, like potato chips and, and potato chips and dip or these kinds of things. It can also be, uh, polarized, and below, you know, a bowl of pasta. Um, which here I'm not trying to demonize carbohydrates. I do ingest carbohydrates. Um, minimally or non-processed carbohydrates, um, most of the time, but not all the time. And they have a fairly potent, uh, effect on lowering stress and perceived stress and even quality of sleep, which is not to say that somebody has to load up on them like crazy, unless their glycogen is really depleted. Yeah. Talk to a lot about this in the endurance episode. I know we'll touch on more in the nutrition supplementation episode. But, um, in thinking about the relationship between carbohydrates and cortisol and what we've just been talking about in terms of cortisol as being vitally important for the adaptation trigger or triggering adaptation. It's probably better way to put it. But that it can blunt cortisol. Take in post training or, um, maybe in the evening before sleep. What are some of the basic ways that one can think about and maybe use carbohydrates in specific ways in order to, let's say, control cortisol rather than, uh, wash cortisol. You actually have alluded to it a number of times already. So we oftentimes will give people a lot of carbohydrates at night. For some of these reasons, um, you're going to feel enthousic. A lot of people that helps you sleep, um, both get to sleep and say it's like, some quality. You talked about specifically, remember, think about it this way. And, um, you know, the whole thing that we've talked about is that it's all at its core is an energy signaling molecule. It says we are in the need for energy. Great. Um, at the reference the same way, you, you'll start seeing, for example, cortisol will liberate, uh, free fatty acids, put them in the bloodstream, get you prepared to do something. The problem is if it's continually elevated throughout the day with no down regulation, we start running into issues, right? So again, this is the differentiation between all my cortisol slightly elevated all day. I had a really big spike after training. I had a really big spike after a breath protocol, etc. And then it went back down. So that being said, if you then ingest carbohydrates, you are telling, it is quick to see the signal. All we have nutrients we have energy against specifically carbohydrates. Therefore, cortisol can sort of go back down. We don't need to be liberating free fatty acids and preparing the need for fuel. So you can help yourself go to sleep for many, as you point around, many mechanisms. Actually, if y carbohydrates will help you sleep at night, I'm for some, not all people, but some, that would be one of the relationships that has with cortisol. Great. I look forward to hearing more about how the various macronutrients and micro-nutrients and so called adaptogens. This very mysterious group of compounds. You know, the word adaptogen gets thrown around so much nowadays. But as long as we're talking about adaptation, I think that'll be fair play for the discussion in the next episode about nutrition and supplementation. In my laboratory, when we study stress, we use a number of different markers, subjective reports of how stressed people feel. Heart rate, morning heart rate, heart rate variability, cortisol, free cortisol and on and on. What are some of the other markers of stress as it relates to exercise adaptations in recovery? Because once again, I think we're seeing a lot of parallels between the study of psychological stress and the study of physical stress. As it relates to exercise adaptation. Remember, in terms of physiology stress is stress. This is why we have this cool term of valestatic load or all the spaces. So it really doesn't matter which system you test for. It will reflect overall stress. You mentioned several of them. We've got done talking about some biomarkers. HRV and heart rate are another great example because what you're trying to do is this, when we were talking about the muscle's soreness thing. What we were really getting at was a marker of how do I fix the overuse in that particular muscle? Now we've really transitioned into global markers overuse and why these are problematic or important to pay attention to rather is Again, these are the indicators that you didn't just work a muscle out too hard, but you have actually done something where you've compromised all of your physiology To a level where you've influenced a circulating cautical immune or something like it's going to influence multiple markers. Now like you're sleeping your mood and your behavior. So that's why these things are problematic. That said, you could look at resting heart rate, not a bad thing to do. However, that does have multiple downsides. One thing we do know is your resting heart rate will elevate with excessive stress load. This actually doesn't matter if it is physical stress or psychological stress or a combination. So you will see that number drift up over time. Here's the downside though. It's not tremendously sensitive to smaller stressors. In other words, if you were to do something like alcohol is a very good example. You will see you're resting heart rate elevate with alcohol use, excessive tobacco use and psychological stress. However, if you do something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart rate is not sensitive enough to pick that up. It will actually probably stay the same. So for those reasons, we don't actually use resting heart rate that much. We will take it, but it's not our primary indicator. That being said, HRV is a better use. So just where the quickly for those are not familiar. Your heart rate, let's say for example, you're resting heart rate is 60 beats per minute. That means every second is beating. It doesn't actually happen on a consistent rhythm such that it would beat on second one, beat on second two, beat on second three, et cetera. The rate is more variable. So a Michael beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat. There's a variation in the heart rate. And at the end of that 60 seconds, you would have still completed 60 beats. They just aren't on the exact same pattern. Well, one thing that's actually quite interesting is the amount of variation in your heart rate is actually associated with your overall sympathetic or person, with that extent, such that a large variation. So an arhythmic pattern is generally more representative of being more rested and recovered and being more person, with that. You'll notice during times of extremely high stress, you will be very rhythmic beat beat beat beat beat beat beat. And so this is a little bit of a confusing idea, but a high HRV is they're indicated of a lot of variation, meaning you're pretty recovered. A low HRV, meaning there's not a lot of variation means you're probably pretty stressed and wire. So it's related to heart rate, but in my opinion, it is a significantly better marker of that. Now, one thing you want to pay attention to if you do this, a couple of things. There are some accuracy issues with many of the devices. Basically, everybody at this point probably has some device that's telling them their HRV. What you do not want to do is simply compare your number to somebody else. For a lot of reasons, not all of these technologies are actually even measuring the same thing. Again, some of them are actually combining with other metrics and calling it your overall readiness or your recovery. So now we've actually done as made a couple of assumptions and then stack them on a whole host of other assumptions and then gave you a number. And you don't know what that sort of black box score actually even represents. So I would caution one against taking too much information from that. And we are actually measuring HRV even within that. There's a lot of ways to calculate that are non-important here. So don't necessarily worry about the score. And compare it to yourself, but not to others. What you will see is if you use similar devices and techniques. And you need a hard to find data here, but in general, people that are overweight might have a little bit of a lower score as in a worse score. We need more information on that to be clear. So in large part, the best way to use something like HRV is to measure it under the exact same circumstances every day. So whether you're going to use device on your watch or your phone or your bed or anything else or you can buy a special HRV on it's fine. Just take that measure at the same time. Mostly this means first thing in the morning. So you wake up, you go to bathroom and come back down and take your measure or something like that. You don't wait. Sometimes you took it before food and then after your look at your phone, like all these other things that can influence stress. So take it. And then you take somewhere between the second and the minute to record. So you want to pay attention to that. Now one of the things you'll notice is there is a natural change in your HRV that just happens. And so what you kind of really want to pay attention to is I guess answering the question of how much of a change in HRV has to happen before I should care. And it's hard to answer, right? So let's just say your HRV was 100. I just made that number of what if you wake up tomorrow it's 99. What's that mean? Well, I don't know. If you wake up tomorrow and it's 20. That's probably a bad thing. Well, where is that line? It's hard. One thing I would recommend doing is taking your HRV for at least a month. Before you start using that value to make any changes. And you recommend taking it first thing in the morning. Yep. Always roughly the same time. Basically, under the same circumstances. It doesn't have to be taken in the morning, but because your day will change on most days. That's the most stable thing in your life. I would take it then and I would collect it for at least a day at least a month rather maybe even six weeks. And then give yourself a busy running average. So what we all quite honestly do is we will actually track it for forever. And then what we always look at is what does it look like today relative to the last week on average. And then what does that look like to our historical average. And we always compare those things. And you also want to make sure you compare like to like. So in other words, I generally will not going to worry about today's HRV score relative to tomorrow's. What I want to look at is today's relative to this exact same day last week. Not for athletes, but for non-authent. This is very important. So imagine don't worry about the difference between HRV score and Monday compared to Tuesday pay attention to Monday compared to last Monday and the Monday before that. That's because you typically have the same sort of weekly schedule. And what you don't want to do is say look at Monday's HRV score, which is a reflection of what happens on day. And compare that to Tuesday's, which is actually your reflection of what happened Monday. You probably didn't do the same stressors on Sunday as Monday. So you're not actually comparing the same thing. But if you have a general weekly schedule, you'd likely to compare this Monday's relative to last Monday's because they're both comparing what happened on the previous day's. So did that sort of distinction make sense? Absolutely. I do the same thing with body weight. By the way, if you're trying to track body, mass gain or fat loss or something, compare like the like. You can look at the daily changes, but you need to pay attention to what that normal distribution is. So if you kind of do that, you know, Monday to Monday thing, that'll give you a rough area of saying, okay, my normal weekly variation is say five. So my average is 100, but I will fluctuate between 95 to 105. That's my standard deviation is sort of science dorks would call that. If you start very changing more than 5% outside of your normal standard deviation, then I'm going to start paying attention a little bit. And I'm going to actually run a little bit of an algorithm on this one. And so here is my thinking process when I get hr really any metric, but hrv is example using first step. Did I collect good data? And what did I mean again, did I measure the same way I measured every single day or did I get up and look at my phone first and I realized, oh crap, I forgot to dig my hrv. And then I went back and out there. So say I had a 15% derivation from my normal number and then I realized, oh yeah, that's right. I was a super late last night doing whatever. Okay, great. I'm going to consider that bad data. You didn't good. And it's bad day, then I'm not doing anything. Ignore. And bad data. You throw it out. You don't use it. If you decide for the most part of this assume it was good data. Okay, great. Then I'm going on my next question, which is, is it acute? In the words, is it just today? Right. Or is it chronic? As this is this pattern happening for more than five days or at least three years last for something like that. Three minimum is what I like honestly. I generally look at five or more days. That's a very big distinction. If it is something that just happened today and the next question I'm going to ask myself is, and I am that adaptation phase. And my trying to be in a phase where I'm trying to cause the insult to the body that it needs to respond with. If that is the case, I'm just going to ignore it. Right. In fact, it's almost sometimes a good sign. Hey, we are stressing the body and it is stressed. What we're doing is working. Amazing. In fact, if you don't see that, it's sort of like, hmm, maybe we're not doing that. To push the face. All right. So great. If the answer is, no, we're in a peaking phase. Then we're actually going to use what I call acute state shifters. So this is a whole host of little tricks that I have that can change HRV or any recovery metric within seconds. Again, these are not chronic fixes. This is just I'm having a bad day today. I feel like crap. Can I make myself feel better right now? And so I kind of call these parlor tricks a lot of the times. And there's the thousand of them. We are certainly not going to go over them. But I'll give you some examples. You can pull out. First of all, physical movement. We'll do it. You be stunned. I'll just do some yoga moving around doing some jumping jacks, starting your workout. I mean, you've probably experienced this. It's sort of cliche in our world at this point. But if you ever do any serious lifting over a serious amount of time, there will be days when what you walk into the gym and you feel awful. And somehow that day you said a lifetime PR. Yeah, that's a strange, strange phenomena. I, I, I, I, I, I experienced that more than a few times. It's rare. The inverses rare. However, you feel great. You have a horrible workout. It happens. Yeah. And it can happen for any number of different reasons. But yeah, I think the the former when isn't feeling very good. And then somehow is it a terrific workout. Does it kind of a seat of doubt as to how good our subjective assessments really are, and which I guess is why we're talking about objective assessments. Yep. Like a charity. And remember, if it's a single day here, you can even do hard training. People sort of have this idea like, well, if you get up in your recovery scores down, do a lighter day. That's probably not like I'm probably never making that choice to be honest. Not in this situation. Remember, this is one bad day. And we are NA phase of even trying to improve performance right now. Like we're probably still training hard. You will again, often see I felt terrible when I trained super hard and it totally changed my day around. This all can happen. So exercises my first love here. Um, absolutely breathing. Um, any sort of up regulation breathing. So we talked a lot about down regulation breathing. Just do the opposite, right? And so this is when hyperventilation strategies can work. Instead of accentuate in the exhale, you accentuate the inhale. Or you restrict the exhale. This is working on the exact opposite situation. You can also play little. This is where things like music. Motivational quotes. Um, if you're the type that follows people on Instagram that motivate you or can work with these things. Coaching tactics. These can be things like. Um, finding out or talking about that person's why. Um, you sort of shared something that a mantra you use. Um, when you're training hard to keep you go better, I'm not going to ask you to share that now. But some people have this sometimes, right? Or you may have this conversation with your out there. We recall this finding out your why, right? So finding out like why are you really here? What are we doing here? And a lot of times you'll hear things like. It's because I grew up poor and I don't know. Everyone would be poor. Okay, great. This is for my children or like any number of things and you can pull that out on these days. You need to be really careful. This is why I call these parlor tricks. Because when you play that card too often, it starts to lose effect, right? And you can only dig to a hole. So often before it's sort of like a, um, the same thing is with music, right? If you every time you go to the weight room, it's blasting death metal at level 10. Well, eventually it's not, it's no longer motivating, right? It's no longer helpful. So you wanted to play these things strategic. Yeah, the, the phrase that comes to mind is signal the noise, you know, the nervous system, especially the dopamine system and the adrenaline system, which are a part of this larger system called the catacolamine system. So that dopamine epinephrine, or epinephrine, the get up and go focus on external goals, movement associated and on and on. That that system responds best to high signal relative to noise. So if you're, as you point out, um, listening music every time drinking, it's kind of caffeine energy drinks, pre-workout, uh, new tropics, and then, you know, stacking all those things, uh, sometimes for for this is dopamine stacking. Yeah. And formally refer to it as dopamine stacking. You're doing all those things. And then you're first of all, then you're wondering why a later that after the next day, you're feeling like you're, you're under a cloud, you're, you're, you're kind of calming system crashed. But it's also that, um, you don't necessarily become dependent on it. It's just that you start to wonder whether or not you have the internal mechanisms and motivation to train without those things. And so one tends to use them more and more and then they have a diminishing effect over time. I mean, um, the rule that I've been, um, sort of applying has been, I never do to work out in a row where I'm stacking in, um, stimulants loud music and any kind of, uh, sort of high potency inspiration. However, every set in the gym or when I run, I really try and be diligent about form and intention to what I'm doing. The one exception would be the long duration endurance work. Part of the reason I do that work is to let my mind go into states of drifting, uh, not trying to think in complete sentences or even close to it. Just let my brain kind of idle at a low home. Uh, and for that reason, generally listen to something that's up more of a story, or don't listen to anything at all and just let my thoughts kind of spool through. Anyway, I don't want to take us too far off track, but I think this, um, um, idea of signal the noise will resonate with the engineers out there, but since most people are likely not engineers, it is the way that the nervous system works, um, evidence by the fact that whatever area of your body right now is in contact with a chair or, um, any other surfaces that's been in contact with for more than a few seconds. You forget that it's in contact with it because there's low signal the noise at that point. Similar note, you actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're talking caffeine or any other stimulant, any other cortisol modulators or adaptogens, any of these things fall in the category if you're not using them consistently, and you're having a rough day and also can you throw down 200 milligrams of caffeine. Uh, it's kind of changed real fast. That's a strong performance in enhancing effect. Yeah, absolutely. And for these reasons, right? So we mentioned a couple of them breath work, um, food, more calories, just eating some food, sometimes we'll give people like what we call comfort foods. So this is just like, hey, you're, uh, you're from Georgia and we know you love grits. So we're having grits for breakfast. Oh, my great. Like, just something to change or mood acute state shifters, um, to alter it. The other couple of tricks here are light. So if we know that maybe say multiple people are struggling that day, maybe we'll put on the lights extra bright. We'll bring us some extra things and just get it more light in there. But then they can count actually going outside and seeing the sun, but perhaps we'll do that. Um, and then other little tricks that I've learned over the years is, uh, one particularly thing I love is literally drawing a line of physical line in the ground. And you look at that line and you say, like, I'm going to train today and I'm going to accomplish this effort. Uh, I'm not going to walk past this line and into that training space until I'm ready to give that effort. And that may take a minute or 10 or whatever. But it's, it's the physical barrier is very important to saying, like, I'm not just going to get through it. I'm going to actually perform the way I want to perform. Or I'm not going to do it. And I'm not going to cross this line and so I'm ready to make that happen. I really like that tool. It also brings to mind the importance of at least thinking about how your relationship with your phone during training, um, can perhaps help, but also impede workout motivation and performance. In an earlier episode, you mentioned that if people are using their phone to play music during their workout, that they establish the complete playlist prior to initiating the workout and then not deviate from that playlist as opposed to changing it in the middle because there's just too much of a, uh, of an impulse to also check. So a Shumidia check email check text messages. I mean, the way I think about the phone actually is it's a bunch of, um, brain areas. It's got a memory system for you. It's got look up tables for look up tables. It's got websites to look things up on the internet. It's got photos. I mean, it is so rich with sensory data. And it's so closely linked to our own brain architecture. They algorithm's are designed for those to be that way. That I always think about it as bringing in a second person with me. But that person is my twin that has severe attention issues. And for those that already have attention issues, just think about this as a twin that would then compound you by tapping on your shoulder, talking to you all the time, interrupting you. Uh, somebody that you like a lot, but that frankly is, um, is a little bit irritating in that they're, they're interrupting your ability to really show up and also your ability to show up for them. So I started to think about the phone as, um, an entire individual and that it represents me and certainly not the better version of me. Great. Exactly. You actually mentioned something else that we'll use, uh, occasionally, which, uh, what we call brain games or puzzles, whether this is a crossword puzzle or something where you actually lose your thought of self for a second, and your brain gets engaged in a task that you weren't regretting or even thinking about. These can be stupid little games. Uh, it could be little challenges, especially if you're in like a group or a team setting. All right. Like we're going to play one round of dodgeball, or we're going to play one round of a thumb horse. So you do encourage this. Yeah. I see. So you would play like a thing instead of warming up, like, all right, get it and everyone get going. We're going to, you know, get your foam roller or your dime or whatever thing. It's just like, everyone line up and we're going to play thumb roars to see who wins. Right? Just like whatever, right? And also, you snap into a new shift or literally playing brain games, playing Tetris on your phone, like any of these things, and can work in this acute setting. Can I ask you a question? It's not directly related to recovery per se, but I think it's worth mentioning or asking about rather, which is the use of mirrors or no mirrors while training. Um, you know, the experience of seeing oneself and observing one's form in the mirror, I suppose it has some utility. You can get some sense of progress that you might trigger. Um, so you're almost specifically referring to resistance training. I suppose it could be cardio if you're running on a treadmill or pushing a slider, something. But, um, you can see form. Um, you can get a sense of, um, what your face looks like when you grimace. Uh, but in all seriousness, um, you are, without question, a person, not you, and you, but um, one is in a less, inter-oceptive mode when looking at themselves in the mirror. So the extra reception, perception of things beyond the confines of our skin, even if it's a picture of us, inter-oception, perception of everything from the skin inward. Um, and so if we're looking at ourselves, we're diverting some allocation of our attention. Let's say, there's a hundred, these are arbitrary units, and you can, I think, put 50% of your attention on the feeling in your body or the muscles you're training. Um, and 50% on how it appears in the mirror, or you could be 100% on the mirror, 100% internally, which you'd best accomplish, probably by closing your eyes. So obviously there are constraints here, certain movements. You wouldn't want to close your eyes, et cetera. In general, what are your thoughts on mirrors or no mirrors for resistance training specifically? It depends on the metric that you find most important. And what I mean by this is if you're training for a same muscle hypertrophy, there's emerging evidence that's just actually looking at yourself in the mirror and even flexing in between sets, can actually be advantageous or can augment muscle gains. Oh my, there's support for all the mirror flexors. Absolutely. Not making fun of you. I just, uh, it is sort of interesting to be on the observing side of that. But hey, listen, results are what people are after. Yeah, having said that, if you're trying to enhance movement learning, then it may be detrimental. So if you're doing an exercise that is explosive and fast, it's probably not the best thing to be looking in a mirror. If you were to walk into any Olympic weightlifting arena and you had any thoughts of using a mirror, you would probably run out of the gym very, very quickly. You can't see yourself in time to make an adjustment with the movement that's happening that fast. And also, we'll do exactly what you mentioned, which is it will remove your ability to understand and feel the movement. And so this is a big component to using technology for exercise at all. Is you have to make sure that the end point is you understanding you and your physiology more, not less. When you outsource learning to technology, in this case, even if the technology is the mirror, you remove your ability to gain and truly understand that learning process. So you need to be very, very careful whether you're using a mirror or whether you're using any number of apps where you can record, say, a movement and then watch it afterwards and it would give you a breakdown of your hand was in the right spot or foot was in the right spot. These are all great. But you need to then take the next step, which is to say, I need to be able to feel that position. All right. So in the case of performance, if you can imagine trying to learn a new technique, say, running technique, and you have to be able to watch yourself in the mirror to understand your stride in the right position. If you don't take the next step of saying, okay, now I don't have to look in the mirror and I can feel what I'm getting out of rhythm or whatever the case is. Then you'll never be able to actually then use that in your race. And so it's very, very important that people again pay attention to what is the dependent variable that you're actually interested in doing. And if you're trying to get better at something, the tech is okay is a starting place. It just cannot be the finishing place. Thank you for those reflections. I'm curious as to what happens or what one should do if their HRV is reduced for maybe three or four or more days in a row. Absolutely. The next question that I'm going to ask is, in that adaptation phase. If so, I'm going to still ignore it just like I did if it was a single bad day. But I'm going to start watching it very carefully. I may actually now introduce some other tests. So I may use a performance test. So you may look at something else. Maybe ask questions. Maybe have some communication either with myself or somebody else. So I'm going to start paying more attention. But I'm still really not going to take much action until that crosses more than seven days of consistent problems. If it does do that or we're in a peaking phase, then I'm going to go to another set of solutions that are truly going to pull me out of the whole rather than just be those acute state shift or These are more what I call chronic state shift. Now, some of these are actually very similar to the ones we've used before. For example, thermal stress. So I can promise you if your recovery score is in the tanks and you walk outside and you jump in your 35 degree water and you get back out. What's going to happen is your HRV score immediately afterwards. I'm talking within seconds is going to be significantly compromised. Right. Now, there was think about that. Remember, low HRV means a high sympathetic. I promise you cold water will push you in a high sympathetic drive. However, and we've tested this pretty extensively. Looking at HRV zero 15 30 60 90 all the way up to 180 minutes post and on average, you will see your HRV score continue to rise after that. And so well, you have this immediate sympathetic response. You will immediately then respond, you know, about 30 minutes on most people depends on the person though, and that score will be improved for several hours afterwards. So, heat can kind of have a similar effect. That actually, again, is sort of an acute fix, but over time as we've described earlier, that can also have a little bit of a chronic effect. We can also then get into areas like sleep. And so now we're going to start playing and exploring why are you sleeping poor as well or was your sleep score fine, but your HRV was low. That's a little bit of a different answer. If your sleep is getting compromised, then we're going to start going into and making sure we're improving our sleep. In terms of like brain stuff. Instead of maybe playing a game or having music or some of these other tricks, those aren't going to really have a chronic effect. But you can do things like work on social connection. That's actually been shown to improve recovery over time. You can do things like journaling or meditation, and those have an acute effect as well as a chronic effect. So again, if you go journal right now, you probably feel better, but also we know that over time that will gradually improve things. Adaptogens and things like that also can have a chronic effect. So can things like electrolytes or food or hydration if those things were were off. So we're going to go to a whole number of areas, but those are the primary ones. Outstanding of all that of course, it may be simply a time to go back and reassess our training program. That's truly the case. So that's where we're at. If so, we're probably going to either completely remove training. Or drop it to like 50% or so until we start rebounding back to baseline. And that's generally the numbers we use. For many people who are not training for a competitive sport, and maybe aren't pushing themselves really hard. They're they consider themselves somebody who exercises in order to maintain health and aesthetics and longevity, et cetera. And they never really finish any workout completely exhausted. They're sleeping okay, they're appetite. So okay, can we assume that they are recovering well? Or maybe they're not creating enough of an adaptation response. Like there's no progressive overreaching. And so there's really no stimulus for recovery. What I'm saying here is on the face of it, I think is obvious, right? If you don't train hard, there's nothing to recover from. What I'm really saying is is the ability to recover itself something that we need to train. And it's can we get better at recovering and the analogy here would be something like focus in order to perform work of any kind. But certainly mental work and physical work, we need to be able to focus. The ability of focus is the reflection of a bunch of neural circuits and chemicals in hormones, et cetera. We know roughly what those are. And we know that if you are poor at focusing for every small bit of time that you can focus a little bit longer, even if it's a matter of seconds, those circuits themselves get better at focusing. And so on and so forth. So in other words, is the recovery system, however, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural, muscular immune based, et cetera, can that system or set of systems become better? Can we get better at recovering, can we meaning, can it become faster and more effective? Can we think of the recovery system is kind of a blade that gets sharper by engaging recovery? Because if so, then there's strong reason for people who are not pushing really hard to push, at least a little bit harder than is comfortable for them every once in a while to make sure that that system doesn't start to slide back. Remember, physiology is listening to everything you do. And it is always responding. So the analogy that I will meet your analogy with that I use here is the bowling alley. So you've probably been bowling before and you've used the bumper lanes, right? The bumper lanes. I've gone bowling before and I spent time in the gutter and I've spent time on the pins. Okay. So it's been a while. We used to have a bowling alley in the town where I went to. It was fun. We used to slide around on those shoes and like all the kids would hang out there and I feel like do they still have bowling alleys? I don't even know. It feels like something that may have gone the way of the mid 2000s. I don't care if no one bills anymore. You're not going to ruin my good analogy. What my intent wasn't to ruin your analogy. Okay. To us about bowling all the bowlers are going to come after me with bowling balls. You're going to get blasted with all the stats and elevations. Cool. So if one were to go bowling and they didn't want to put their ball on the gutter, you could put these little bumpers in those lanes. And these little foam pads that go on the gutter that if your ball is going towards the gutter, it hits those and bounces off and goes back in the lane. Okay. So in this entire conversation, this is actually true of a lot of the way people approach their fitness and health. People are very concerned oftentimes with optimizing, meaning I want to make sure I don't go on the gutter. I don't want to hit the walls. So therefore I'm going to try to improve the accuracy in which I throw the ball. So I want to make sure that I'm throwing it down the center of the lane more often. And I want to get my standard deviation tighter and tighter so that I don't get anywhere close to hitting the wall. However, what they're not realizing is if you do that, the body will start shrinking the size of the lane. Because what it basically says is, we haven't had a ball touch us in years. We don't need to be this wide. Let's get smaller and smaller and smaller. So it's not that you actually are having a reduced ability to recover, but you start becoming incredibly sensitive to that. So your two strategies for answering recovery are to practice getting closer, throwing that ball down the middle lane, or to widen to widen the alley. And that's exactly what you're referring to. And you absolutely should do that. And so what happens is you don't have to be so precise with what you're doing because your ability to handle so many things is widen. So if you're often out by four or five inches to the right, no problem because you've just tripled the size of your alley. That's exactly what you want to do. So paying attention to two things. Number one is getting better at accuracy. Maybe staying really tight with your progressions. Using nutrition and sleep to optimize your recovery and push your resilience is what we call this. In fact, there's actually a biological way to measure resilience. We do that in all of our folks. This is scientifically validated stuff. I didn't just make it up. You can actually measure resilience. And there's more and more coming out on this. But that's exactly what that term is. So how well can you handle and bang things off the threshold? So when you see a reduction in say 10% of your HRV today, for you, that might make you feel terrible. For me, I might not feel anything because I'm well adapted to large fluctuations. And therefore I'm okay. The less and less you do that, the more and more responsive you will be to those slight deviations. So that is exactly the target. And that's kind of what I look to. And I say, you got to understand what we optimizing for. We optimizing for making sure I don't feel any different today. And we optimize and make sure when I do feel different, I still am able to perform. So this is why you want to do things like maybe use some caffeine today and feel great. But if I have to use it every day, all I'm doing is shrinking my sensitivity there. So now if I have to go with day without it, I can't train at all. So what I'm having is the easy example because people understand how that holds this work. But this is really true of everything else. So yeah, you need to practice this. And the way to do that is to give yourself more stress. To continue to bring in this rest from nutrition, from training, from breath work. You mentioned earlier about focus. The exact same thing, right, it's not just about getting better right now. It's about training a system. So you're clearly trained that right. We will often say, breath work is a practice. That's exactly what we're talking about right. So you're practicing getting better at these things. You're practicing returning your focus. You're practicing recovering. And quite literally physiologically, you can up regulate whether we're talking enzymes, whether we're talking about regulators. These will be up regulated so then the next time the that insult comes in, it's not as big as sign as damaging. Yeah, absolutely you can and you should strive for that throughout all the episodes where we've been talking about exercise. At the core of that is this word adaptations. And I love that you mentioned that breath work can also create adaptations. The way I'm visualizing all of this now is that resistance training with weights machines bodyweight otherwise. Cardiovascular training running jogging, sprinting jumping and so on. Thermal training exposure to heat exposure to cold in a dedicated way. And deliberate respiration, aka breathing or breath work as a practice. All of those can be viewed as ways to trigger adaptations. And in the context of recovery, the specific adaptations you're trying to engage are opposite to stress. In fact, with the exception of perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe deliberate heat exposure because if the sauna's really hot, you can get the dinorphin release which is kind of uncomfortable. But still in both those cases, the rebound from that in other words, when you get out, you shower or you go to bed. The next morning you do have this kind of blissed out feeling, we know why that is that is the rebound to that uncomfortable situation. So it seems it doesn't really matter whether or not you're using resistance, you're doing cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches or you're using respiration based approaches. All of these are really ways of both triggering adaptations and if applied properly to actually help you recover from the stress and create the literal result that you're trying to achieve. For some people that might have been obvious, but I think for many people, including myself, this set of conversations that we've been having over the series, these episodes. So the first time that I've ever thought about exercise in these ways. In any event, it's just a reflection, but it's one that at least for me is tremendously useful because it has a lot of organizational logic to it, which at least appeals to my brain because the more that things have a logic, the more for me that they become simplified in the more that the vast array of tools. It becomes visible to me as you said earlier, what does it let me make sure I get this right, it's concepts or few methods or many. Pretty close. Okay. How would you put Ronda's how you stayed it? Methods or many concepts are few. Ah, okay. Either way, the directionality probably doesn't matter. No, let's keep it right. The methods or many concepts are few. Galpons law. I'm in science you're not allowed to name things after yourself, but you can name things after other people. So it's a Galpons law. Because I'm definitely the one who created that idea. Right. Absolutely. That was extreme and tremendous sarcasm to so we're ultra. Regardless, here we go. Galpons law. There you go. One thing that's in my head right now is we've thrown out a lot of options for folks and maybe what we can do is try to simplify. A little bit. So what I can kind of walk you through is how we measure recovery if you will and how often and some tools and what I would recommend people do is not use everything I said. You want to pick one or two things for category that are most important to you that are at your cost that are at your availability that are interesting and important relevant to you and do that. The reason I kind of wanted to cover a large number of things was to give them a vote options, but again, I want to emphasize the point is to not measure all of them. In fact, you don't need to. We, I've ran this before with professional athletes where we've taken blood, urine. Every single day we've done performance measures, vertical jumps on a force plate. Whole bunch of things every day for years on end and what I can tell you is there is tremendous redundancy and physiology. Everything is everything so you don't need to do them and don't feel like you're missing out if you aren't doing them. One or two metrics is probably fine. I generally recommend one subjective measure. This could be as simple as what's your mood. How do you feel today? Great. And one objective measure HRV, resting heart rate, anything else. So if you even literally just did that, you'd probably have pretty good insight as to what you're doing. So maybe in fact, I'll go more detail here. Maybe I'll give you a couple of examples of things to measure every day. Some things that you should measure, maybe you want quarterly, monthly, and then maybe even some annually. And then you can maybe just pick a couple of, for me, to this category, so you have yourself a pretty good monitoring system for what to do. And I'll include some that are a little bit of technology based and then others that are totally cost-free and require nothing. Okay, to start off, I would recommend taking something like HRV every day or most days. If you don't have a device like that, you could also use honestly the CO2 tolerance test. We've talked about that a number of times and we probably have plenty of research to go find that. But that doesn't require anything. It typically takes about a minute or so. And you can do that under the same circumstances in which HRV in other words, do it the same time every day, have the same standardization stuff. And that is actually been in our coaching experience. While admittedly, there is no peer reviewed research on this yet. Just in our experience, this tends to track extremely closely with HRV and other metrics of recovery. In fact, we actually did do a pilot trial in my lab and it track decently well with both state and trading anxiety. So it's a nice metric. I'm not perfect, but you could take that. So if you wanted, you could do both. But again, remember, you're trying to capture systemic stress. And so you're really just showing your measuring one thing two ways. So you don't necessarily have to have them both. I will do both just because I'm super interested in small differences. But globally, they're going to tell you basically the same thing. So those are two things we'll use again, basically daily, around or close to it. If you want to go past that a little bit, you can use an actual, a pretty old commonly used survey called Adalda, DALDA. I forget the exact acronym, but it is a fairly lengthy questionnaire. And it accounts for things like how do you feel today, how did you sleep, a stressor is going on in life, how you've been eating. And this is like fairly comprehensive lengthy survey that came out, I mean, Jesus probably been around for 30 years or something. Is it's nothing new and been used extensively. I, you would not want to do that every day. If you wanted to take some subject and measures every day, we typically stick with, like I said, mood, motivation, something like that. You could perform this to all the tests, so something more like monthly, or at the end of each training phase, you know, every couple of months. And probably worth looking at, it's not going to tell you if you're in a bad spot today or tomorrow, but you would pick that up with the HRV or suit to tolerance as it would, though, tell you information, especially if you're working with another individual, about major life changes. And if anything, it just facilitates that conversation, right? I noticed you reported X happening. Let's talk about that and kind of help, et cetera. So another kind of sneaky, helpful one is simply body fat, like I said, non-functional overreaching and overtraining are associated with the number of things like energy, appetite suppression, changes in body weight or body composition. So you can measure that monthly or even really quarterly, depending on what kind of athlete or individual you're working at, or if you're trying to, especially if you're not trying to lose weight or if you're trying to be at maintenance. And that'll give you some insights as well. So moving past that now, actually, we're going to move into the realm of things that we call hidden stressors. So those are all visible stressors. So hidden stressors, the most common ones we've sort of mentioned, and I would probably do this, you're going to have to do these ones through serum. So this is blood work. Court is all like we talked about in testosterone and then of course testosterone, of course, in a horizontal ratio. And then the other ones I mentioned, you can do those quarterly. It's not bad. There are some blood markers that there's really no sense to do them that soon. And there are other markers. I mean, in our system, our individuals are getting pretty sensitive blood work, saliva work, urine and stool. And there's so there's plenty of those things you just do not need to measure every 10 weeks or so. In this case, you know, course all, as you know, sort of changes rapidly. Testosterone can change pretty quickly. But if you're really trying to notice a larger trend, you know, certainly it quarterly or so is an appropriate time frame. Doing it every four or five weeks is probably unnecessary. So you can save yourself some money and do that. Other stuff you can look at actually more like semi annually in plasma, like glutamine and glutamine to glutamate ratio. And you can maybe save that why you want to look at those for another conversation. But those are important. And we always look at something from the oxidative stress thing. So this could be something like TNFL for an early looking six, something like that. Again, we're looking at that in serum and we're looking at that, you know, like semi annually. And then another sneaky actually one that I love to look at is the Nutraphil, the lymphocyte ratio, which gives him pretty good insight. And again, you could look at that like fairly quarterly. If that number starts to get really high, certainly like more than 91, you got a pretty good insight that something gnarly is going on with your immune system. So we will actually take action much lower than that number. But that's like a nice cut off you'll see is like that's very, very high number. So those are some things you can use. Most folks have the ability hopefully to get some basic blood work done. Get a basic what's called a CBC and CMP. If you have a great physician and you can get insurance to cover that. And you just go on an ask for a CBC and CMP. They'll know what that means. You can Google that and they'll order it. You'll get all the information typically that I described or close to enough. And you'll get some insights. And then again, you can just use that free service. And I said earlier to check to see what are not the changes are just a matter of testing quality or actually physiologically relevant. What you just described is an amazingly powerful array of tools. I'm hoping that you can also mention a few tools that are either lower cost, truly low cost or zero cost that while they may not have the accuracy or give the complete picture. That's some of the biomarkers and other tools that you mentioned do that they can still provide reasonably reliable metrics that people can use in order to assess their level of recovery. Absolutely. The CO2 tolerance test would be the first one. And you can just take that metric anytime you'd like. The other ones we've talked about so far are things like your mood. We haven't mentioned libido, but that's another assessment that people also tend to have a pretty good grip on. And they know what feels normal. So when things go out of whack, it tends to be a pretty good signal that people will recognize. Yeah, and one note about that, something that came up in an episode on hormones both for male and female health. That at some point it will air, which is that. There's no objective measure for people in terms of libido across the board, meaning people very tremendously. Age, life circumstances, and on and on. And so this is one of those subjective measures that I think people need to. Have some sense of what they're quote, quote, quote, baseline really is. And I'm guessing that the time to assess that might best be when initiating or midway through a relatively low intensity training phase. Maybe during the time of year in which all the other factors that can influence libido are not. At their maximum. So if you think about, you know, light and dopamine and the relationship between those and the testosterone and estrogen systems, we know that libido. Testosterone and estrogen men and women tends to peek in the summer months. So if that's your baseline that you're comparing to, I don't know that that says reliable as. I mean, something like the fall or the spring. And so anyway, this again is very subjective, but we just encourage people to recognize that there's no standard numbers for this. No look up table. And there's a no equivalent of the libido BMI, the LMI. I'm not just respected the acronym that probably is LMI. So I think that it's just something to keep in mind as people do comparisons or subjective comparisons is. You don't pick a comparison to an extreme trying pick a comparison to average as you know it to be that actually is sort of reminding me one issue that we have seen a lot lately is people. If they're having libido issues or just even slightly noticing a drop. They just assume that then their four means are testosterone is crashing. And those things are certainly connected, but that is not necessarily the case. And where that becomes a problem is in people then go on things like TRT, etc. With no true oversight and then all kinds of other problems. So make sure that if you're going to take that step that you actually get testosterone measured and you're working with a qualified person to guide you through that process. Don't just assume because you're having low energy or your libido is a little bit down. It could be simply training related. It could be easily related. It could be any number of things. So that's like a little bit of a word of caution there. Two quick points along the lines of what you just said. One interesting thing that I learned when researching our episode on testosterone and estrogen optimization. This was an episode that we done some time ago, but it's still available in our cubrimanlab.com all formats, etc. Is that many people actually increase their libido and even their levels of testosterone and estrogen as they progress from their 20s into their 40s. If they take excellent care of themselves, including the correct exercise adaptations, correct body fat to lean muscle ratios. But of course, it can go the other way too. A lot of people can be training to achieve such low body fat stores that libido can suffer. So you know, the age-depend, age-related declines in libido are not necessarily written into the script of life. In fact, there are some data points. I'm really interesting paper. I talked about in that episode of individuals. This was a study focused on males in their 80s and 90s who maintained total and free testosterone as high as individuals in their 20s. But then when you look at the lifestyle factors of those people in their 80s and 90s, they were doing a lot to create that scenario. The second point is one related to what you just said, which is very true, which is people generally tend to assume that a drop in libido is related to a drop in testosterone and then assume that they need to increase their testosterone. And in some cases, that is true. Absolutely. But it's also often the case that people who take estrogen or aromatase blockers, and then as enzyme inhibitors that prevent the version of testosterone to estrogen, experience severe deficits in libido because of estrogen totally low. So estrogen blockers are as much an issue here as low testosterone. Then the final point is also one that many people now men and women are, I think, need to be aware of, which is that dihydroids testosterone, DHT, is among the more powerful and regions for power output, physical power output, but also for libido. And DHT is strongly inhibited by certain things like tumeric. A lot of people who are taking a high doses of tumeric can experience drops in libido. So they're and who are taking various compounds to prevent her loss. Yep. Things like finaster eye. So there's a whole catalog of things that can reduce libido that are not directly in the testosterone pathway. It can be a DHT related or estrogen related. And this, I think, points to the importance of, yes, take a subjective measure of your libido. That's actually be aware. Don't obsess, but be aware and try and figure out what factors are involved for you. But don't immediately assume that what's needed is more testosterone and oftentimes the opposite is the case. Yeah, you try to put on a lot of muscle with estrogen. Good luck. Right. And indeed a lot of athletes in particular competitive biobilers that have that, you know, seran wrap thin skin. If you get to know some of those people when you talk to them, they can look like the sort of comic book archetype of what someone might might want to be. I mean, that's not what this discussion or these episodes have been about, but oftentimes they can have serious libido issues. I mentioned earlier, and I will emphasize it once more. You need to be very cautious when you're taking antioxidants and type inflammatorys, cortisol, reducers for all those reasons. I didn't really sort of get an examples, but you just nailed another fantastic reason of it. We do not give those things prophylactically. I strongly discourage people from just walking around taking supplementation of antioxidants, especially powerful ones for no reason. If you have done some testing and you have a good reason to do so, I'm fine. Or if you're in a very specific training phase or something like that, cool. But if you're just walking around doing that, you are oftentimes not always, but you're oftentimes causing problems that then you then try to solve by taking more of those anti inflammatorys. I feel terrible, low energy, low libido, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I'm too inflamed, et cetera. So yeah, antioxidants in the form of food are fantastic. Almost no issue. There is good evidence actually there. So don't worry about man, I shouldn't eat high antioxidant rich foods. You're going to be fine. What we're talking about here is pharmaceuticals and supplementation, where you can take orders of magnitude higher dosages very quickly, and you could in the presence of food. So that distinction is also very important. Anti-oxent rich foods are generally fine, and that's consumed in totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations, powder, screen, strokes, et cetera, is where you can get into problems. So yeah, you want to be very careful of doing that unless you have a reason. We don't do that unless we see a reason to do so in someone's markers. Yeah, an herbal compounds, despite the fact that there are herbal can be quite potent modulators of hormones, ashruganda being an example to herbal compounds that we've talked a lot about on our podcast before, and repeatedly including in that testosterone, and optimization episode, Tonga Ali and Fadoji Agrestis, Tonga Ali's now taken by a large number of men and women. Tonga Ali and Fadoji are typically men. I'm not sure that there are any good studies about the effects of Fadoji in women. Those are herbal compounds that can have potent effects in increasing testosterone and lootinizing hormone. Do they work? Yeah, they work to varying degrees in most everybody, not certainly not in everybody, but they do work, but they work because they're potent, they have effects. So the idea that herbal compounds are not powerful is wrong, and it's important to remember that that can cut both ways. Hence, my mention of this observation related to tumoric, which is not to say that some people can't take tumoric and feel perfectly fine, maintain or even increase their libido. I sure that can happen, it's just that for people that are very DHT sensitive, this tends to be an issue. So unfortunately, for many of these compounds, the only way to find out is really to try them, or to just completely avoid them in this idea. You don't want to try them in this fine too, but there really aren't ways to predict who will respond, who won't, and who will be hyper-responders. And in that case, it's a bit of a, it's a little bit of a wild west. I'm also sort of remembering what the point of this conversation was supposed to be, and maybe I'll overturn back to that, which was some cost for your low cost metrics. That was a very fun tangent, but nonetheless, another couple of ones you can do are grip strength testing. So if you can buy a fairly cheap hand-grip dynamometer on any number of places, these are typically able to be purchased for $20 to $40 or something like that, right? You can actually just test that every day. I've done that in a number of athletes for a decent amount of time admittedly. I don't do it anymore. And that's not because I disagree with it, but because we're just getting the information already, and it was just too redundant. But if that's the only option, it is a great one to do. I mentioned also earlier how I actually like speed tests over strength tests as an earlier indication of overreaching. And so because of that, I like a vertical jump test. If you have access to a force plate, that's great, and then you can get more in depth characteristics of the force velocity curve and acceleration and things like that. Use a lot in high performance situations. If not simply looking at your performance. So you can kind of go back to one of our earlier episodes when I described coloring my fingertips with highlighters earlier in my life. You can do the same thing and go out in your garage and every day jump up and touch that marker and see where you're at. So a system like that could be done. You can also use tools like a force transducer and do a standard movement. I can say a vertical jump or a high pole or something like that and measure the velocity and just compare that day to day of a standard load. So you do it every single time with the same load. Same similar thing could be done with like a metasable throw. So you have the same ball, you throw the same thing and this sort of where you're at today. You want to do a little bit of warm up but not excessive here. You want to kind of get an idea of where your baseline is and you don't want to influence it by the veracity of the warm up every single day because that alone can change it. Same thing was stretching. Accute static stretching directly influences power production. So you don't want to go out there and one day do a 20 minute stretch before and then the other day. You didn't stretch at all because that alone will cause deviations in your performance. So try to keep everything you can think of standardized and that'll give you a little bit better data remembering all of these values. The biomarkers, the performance of they have normal variations. You just want to figure out first and foremost what those normal variations are for you. So you have your normal number. You have your standard deviation. When you start getting outside of that standard deviation you start paying attention. So that's kind of like what we typically call that the gray zone. And so if it is in the gray zone we're fine. We're not adjusting. We'd if it's outside of that whatever that is for you recognizing that the gray zone is smaller for some folks and larger for others. But what is normal for you and your situation and then you can make your decisions outside of that when you see numbers that are consistently or more than three to five days. In a row or close for the last five days for the last six something like that. Then you may have some cause for action. Well that was an incredible description of the various tools and modes for recovery. And I realize that jump the gun a bit during our discussion about food and supplements. But I like to think that serves as a nice precursor to the next episode which is going to be all about nutrition and supplementation.

Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion about fitness exercise and performance with Dr. Andy Galpin. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. Thank you."
vid00004," Welcome to the Human Lab guest series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and optymology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks the fourth in the sixth episode series on fitness exercise and performance. And today's episode is all about optimal fitness programming that is how to design a fitness and exercise program that can achieve the goals that you want for So fitness and for sports performance. Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back. In previous episodes, you taught us about the various adaptations that occur at the level of cells, at the level of organs. Indeed, at the level of the entire body, the underlying things like improvements in strength and speed, high-perchography, A.K. muscle growth and the various forms of endurance. And you laid out beautifully the various protocols that one can do in order to achieve each and every one of those adaptations. Today, I'd love for you to teach us how we can combine different protocols to achieve multiple adaptations in parallel. For instance, how to improve endurance and strength, how to achieve some level of hypertrophy, perhaps directed hypertrophy at specific muscle groups, while also maintaining endurance and perhaps improving speed. For instance, and if you would, I'd love for you to tell us how we can combine different protocols and vary those across the week, across the month, across the year, so that we can make regular progress. And perhaps even you could give us a window into the ways to make the fastest progress possible. I would love to do that. We've invested a lot of time in the previous episodes, hovering background and concepts and detail about the physiology. So you understood why you're making the choices you're making and why other choices are less effective. In this discussion, I would actually like to jump maybe more directly to the answer and kind of get right into the protocol. So maybe a little bit less background. If you're interested in that stuff, I suppose you have to go backwards a little bit and watch some of those previous episodes. But I would love to jump into just some samples, some case studies, if you will, and kind of walk through different protocols. I know that over the course of my 11 years is a college professor and being in the public space a little bit. Probably the most numerous style of question I have gotten is exactly that. So I know the rep range for this, I know the style of training for that adaptation, but how do I put them together? And I would just like to spend our time today going through those things. And the reason I want to do it is this. Some people listening at home, surely, just love exercise. They're already bought in and they're going to train no matter what. And they're interested in just actually being more effective. And so the way that you structure and put your plan together will in large part determine getting more progress for less effort. Or actually being able to put the same amount of effort in getting results faster. There's also some folks probably listening who are like, okay, I exercise, I do what I can. I'm bought into the benefits. So you've talked so elaborately over the 100 plus episodes you've done about the various benefits of exercise, but you don't like absolutely. You're kind of doing it because you know it's important but you're not there. So for those folks, it's sort of like, okay, how can we actually make this thing more effective? So we can make sure you hit the things you have to absolutely have to get for the short and long term benefits, right, to make sure that you're looking the way you want to look. You're performing physically the way you want to perform and then you can do that across your lifespan. So how can we give you all some structure to where again, you don't have to turn into an absolute. Lover of physical fitness and it doesn't have to take over your life, but you can still get more results for your same time restrictions. Whether that be you have two days a week or five days a week or only certain access to equipment or experience. Whatever the case may be, how can we help those folks as well, but together, they're protocol that will get them closer to their goals with less restrictions. Fantastic. And I'm hoping that along the way, you'll also point us to how often to take the fitness assessment for each of the adaptations that you referred to in a previous episode. We will also link to that fitness assessment segment in the show note captions for this episode because that fitness assessment for different adaptations. I think is a really powerful way for people to touch in and see how much, you know, how much long endurance do they have, how much, how much an aerobic capacity do they have, how much strength do they really have. And then perhaps you'd also be willing to throw in a couple of additional ways that we can assess our level of fitness and progress in this arc of fitness program across the year. Amazing. I can't wait to do that. I think it is also important before we jump into acknowledge a lot of folks, maybe thinking themselves. I don't really necessarily need a plan. Why do I have to do that? I don't have a certain goal. I'm going after I'm not running a race anytime soon. I'm not a competitive athlete. I just go to the gym and I work out. And that's great. Well, I would like to try to convince you that regardless of where you're at, having a plan will achieve those things we just talked about, which is more success in a shorter time frame. There's actually a significant amount of research to support this. Those individuals who go on a specific training plan compared to those who do not will receive better results, independent of the effectiveness of the program. Right. So we've talked in previous episodes about tons of different styles and strategies and reiterate. It really doesn't matter which one you pick. The fact that you have a plan is always more effective than not having a plan. And so again, even if you're not planning on competing with something, if you want a short and the amount of time you're in the gym, get more results from it, I would strongly encourage to put something together. The two largest reasons why people don't get results with their fitness training protocol is number one adherence and then number two, some sort of progressive overload. Both of those two things are challenging to accomplish without a plan. Right. So the reason people don't go to the gym, one of them. And one of the reasons why it takes them so long is because they don't walk in with a very specific plan. It's sort of like going to the grocery store and figuring out what you're going to buy versus knowing exactly what you're going to get in your shopping. That's grabbing those things and getting out. You'll notice your time in the grocery store is half the length. You're more productive and you didn't waste money on extra things. Okay. So that alone will drive it here and it's because you're not going to think of yourself, all that 90 minute workout I do is actually really just 60. And so now the next time you go to train you're like man, I don't have 90 minutes, you realize it's only 60 or 40 or 30 or 20 or whatever it needs to be. So that alone will get you there. Second part of that which is overload. It's very difficult to understand and remember, while the last time I did lat raises I used I think five pounds and then I think I did like 12. Well, if you don't have some sort of system of tracking and this can be as simple as a notebook just writing down what you did before and doing a little bit more the next time. That is going to almost guarantee you success. So having some structure and this structure can be fairly loose. We're going to talk about a bunch of different examples Is something I strongly encourage everyone to utilize for their exercise. Before I begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is however part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Momentus. This makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The human-min lab podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentus for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations. With single ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, Momentus Supplement Ship Internationally, and this is of course important because we realize that many of the human-min lab podcast listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the human-min lab podcast, in particular supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery, you can go to live-momentus spelled OUS so that's live-momentus.com slash human. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've been using an 8 Sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I'm sleeping about the same amount, but I'm sleeping far deeper, and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so-called rapid eye movement or REM sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically. The underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward. There's a lot of time to be able to do this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep at night, your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees in terms of core body temperature and waking up involves a one to three degree increase in core body temperature. With 8 Sleep mattress covers, you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the start of the night, a different temperature of the middle of the night, and a different temperature as you approach morning. Which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 Sleep.com slash Huberman and check out their pod 3 cover and save $150 at checkout. 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU and Australia. Again, that's 8 Sleep.com slash Huberman to save $150 at checkout. So what sorts of things should people be thinking about when developing an overall fitness program? A few minutes ago, we were talking about how two of the major reasons people don't get as much either training programs as they would like is because of one a lack of adherence and two a lack of progressive overload. So the solution to that is constructing a plan that lives within your realistic limitations. So I would like to walk you through my 10 Step Approach to how I design training programs. Now, before I do that, I think it is fair and important for the audience to understand that this is simply my approach. I've been doing this a long time. I played college football and I wrote my own training programs back then. I have an instill working with professional athletes and PGA tour and the NFL, the NBA Major League Baseball, as well as a ton of general population folks. This is a combination of the evidence space that we've been talking about in terms of best practices for strengthening the conditioning as well as just my years of experience. So there are many, many ways one could do this. I'm not even suggesting this is the best. This is simply how I do it. This is exactly how I handle it when I know individual comes to me and how I teach my students. So Step Number 1 is assessing properly and identifying a training goal. Now, that's actually sort of funny because we hear that a lot, but a lot of people actually never take that step. Not to call anybody in the room out. What's happening here is this morning, Andy Dr. Galphin and I were training together and he was providing amazing tips on form and set captains and the sort of thing. He said, so what's your training goal for the next 12 months and I paused and it turned into a very long pause. Which is an easy nice way of saying he didn't have an answer. I didn't have an answer. Of course, I don't just want to maintain what I've developed in terms of strength and hyperchereen endurance, but I don't have a clear goal. So I'm hoping that by the end of today's discussion, I will be on track to a clear set of goals to show you. I'm not going to bore you all here, but really I can't stress enough how important that step really truly is to getting results. The analogy we use here is if you left your house and you were attempting to get to the grocery store and you just started driving. And if you drove every possible road, you would eventually get to a grocery store. So yes, that can work. A better approach is saying, here's where I am. There's where I want to go. What is the optimal route there? And that's really what you're doing with goal. So it is a boring step. It is not interesting to hear. I don't have any real hacks or tricks for you. But it is step number one on purpose. We have to know exactly where we're going. You can do this in two ways. Number one is just pick something arbitrarily decide I'm going to run a 5k or I've done that before and I want to improve it by 10 seconds. I want to lose 10 pounds. You can just pick one. That's great. Another way is to run through that fitness testing protocol. We described a few episodes before. And if you do that, you can see which of these areas that maybe you have the largest lagging in or what is the most severe performance anchor is how we refer to it. And then choose that as your primary and goal. So either option. Some people come into training programs with a very clear goal in mind. They want to add more muscle or whatever. Okay, great. If you're like, I don't really know. I just kind of work out. Then run the fitness testing protocol. You'll see what score is the lowest in. And then you'll maybe make that a priority for the next to say three months. The first step is to identify a specific or set of specific training goals. A really nice tool for helping you set a goal is a system called smart. Right now there's a little bit of debate on what those acronyms actually stand for, but we'll get close enough. So smart is often specific. Measureable attainable realistic and timely. So starting off with as specific in general the more specific your goal is. The higher likelihood you will have as succeeding in that. And being measurable means it needs to be something that you can actually put a metric on. So this can be objective or subjective, but generally I like to have at least one objective measure. So remembering objective is something that is not based on feeling. It is not up to you. This could be something simple like your body weight. It could be how much you can bench press. What's your one mile time. And whatever is most important to you it actually doesn't have to be a fitness related goal. For example if you're using fitness as a way to enhance your sleep. The main metric you may be interested in is you know my amount of hours sleep slept. It could be something like a efficiency or whatever is most interested. It could be work productive. It doesn't really matter. So it doesn't have to actually be the fitness goal. But what is the motivation of why you're doing it. So that's specific measureable attainable or actionable. This is often described is something that is within your capability. So attainable a bad example of attainable is something like my goal is to win more games. That may not be up to you. The team the other team you're playing it could influence it, the schedule etc. So attainable should be something that is within your control. Realistic or relevant to you is something that is again something realistic that you can achieve. You wouldn't want to make a goal that is you want to double your body mass. That's not going to happen. So think about the constraints. How old are you? What's your training experience? How much time you really have to invest in this and then pick something that is realistic and then honestly my little twist here is take that in minus 10%. Typically when people put together training programs their goal tends to be quite lofty and they get some small percentage of the way in realize they're never going to get there and then back off. We actually sort of reminds me of a classic deception study that we didn't and my lab one time where we took people and we had them do this maximal front raise basically so you held a dumbbell out in front of you. For those long as you possibly could and the goal here was actually it's a deception study so we're tricking them. And so we said okay we want to just get normative values to see how long people can hold this front raise and I think we use something like 5% of their body weight. And so they came in and they did it one time and we timed them. They didn't get to see the clock they left. And then we said we got to come back and repeat it right we got to do a couple of tries here to get a normal value in case it's off whatever. Well the participants were split up into four groups so group one actually was told that their time was 15% lower than that they actually got. Group two was 5% lower group three was 5% higher and group four was 15% higher. So the second time they came in to do it are graduate student quote unquote made a mistake and left the timer in front of them. So the first time again they did the exercise they're just holding it they don't know how many idea how long they're holding the second time they had a giant iPad set like just a little bit off center or they can clearly see it so they watched the time go by. And of course what happened was those folks say who did one minute the very first time when they tested they came back in to do the second time and they're holding it and we told them they actually got 45 seconds. When a reality they had done a minute so they're holding it and holding it and they think they only did 45 seconds by the time they get the like second 40. 41 42 they get past 45 they almost all quit like 47 48 seconds because they wanted to beat their previous score. But then we're like cool I beat it and then they quit early. So they were actually not yet to failure but they were just happy enough to beat what they thought they'd done and then they quit. The other group on the inverse side again said they got a minute we told them they got a minute and 15 seconds. They got to like 45 seconds 50 seconds and started realizing oh man I have 30 more seconds to go and they quit way early. Because the carrot was way too far out they realized I'm never going to get there so I'm just going to stop now. Can you guess which group did the best on the post test once they were just within about 5% of totally so they wanted to improve and so again say they got a minute the first time. We told them they got a minute five or sorry they got a minute five the first time we told them they only got a minute they actually exceeded that. Greatly because they wanted to be. So making sure that that goal is properly aligned it needs to be a little bit scary. A little bit unrealistic. You're going to have to work for this if it's too easy you'll quit. You won't feel like a challenge if it's too hard though you'll quit early as well. So you want to make sure it's that reasonable balance of like. I should have trained today like me about just go to if I do that I'm not going to hit. I got I got to get after it but not like oh my god like there's just no chance here so you're going to walk way early. It's a fantastic study I have to say it's very simple I think it illustrates a number of important psychological principles about. We're also setting motivation self perception but also the dopamine system you know the the dopamine system is this universal reward system that meaning it doesn't only work for food or only work for fitness goals or only work for academic goals or relationship goals it is the. And I think that's the universal substrate for all of that and actually think there's some real gems of information and the study design that you describe so just cue that for maybe a potential collaboration between our laboratories because. I think it's very important but it does queue up another question I relevant to fitness particular which is. So let's say my goal is to drop 2% to 2% of body fat from where I am now a year from now roll into the next year. From now about 2% lower on body fat but maintain my. Lean body mass or maybe even increase it. Yep. How should I assess progress you know because the dopamine system loves a goal that it loves anticipation of a goal but it responds best to we sort of re up if you will our dopamine anytime we get a. Signal that we are on the right track to that goal and that signal could be okay I did the workout I just trust that these workouts are going to give me the result I want. But of course we know that when people get a glimmer of. The idea or some objective feedback that they're on the right path that dopamine system really fires and provides motivation for. Continuing toward the ultimate goal and as we've talked about in the strength speed and hypertrophy episode resistance training itself has this built into it because of the. In fusion of blood into the muscles you actually get a little window into what you might get in terms of an adaptation simply by the way of the so called pump whereas endurance type work generally doesn't have that you don't see yourself get better drop back and then adapting actually get better but that's actually what you see with weight training. So given all of that contour of the dopamine system. What sorts of intermediate goals should I set for myself or should somebody set for themselves and I realize it will probably depend on the ultimate goal. But would you say check in on progress once every week every month three months. I can't I don't know if you can tell the look on my face. I love this this question in this topic I spend so much time on it on my senior graduate level program design course. I've been fortunate to work with a few athletes where we've had multiple years. And if you can really take the time to step back and go it's not about optimizing for the next six weeks and in this case. It's not the next fight. The championship fight that we need to get to in three years or it is the Olympics which are on a quad program right you really optimizing for that four year. If you can have that foresight and really think about that and then work backwards you can see some pretty tremendous things the the sort of saying that is like we gently we tend to overestimate what we can get done on a week and underestimate what can happen in a year. That can be extraordinarily powerful. However, you have to have those metrics called out ahead of time because you will lose motivation in that short term because you won't see that result immediately. But if you remember I'm on a path to four percent or two percent or whatever you need to be. Therefore I only need to be this far right now. I need to be that far and then that far. It's actually quite clear and so what we would actually do in that scenario. Not to go it's like so off track here because I can really go on this stuff is let's say it was the year recommendation. You're going to actually need to go to the last part of smart which is timely. So part of setting this goal is making sure you understand the time domain responsible and it's actually quite great here because. Not to go inception on us where we're like list within a list and Rob kills us over here. But number one of this program design thing was assessing your goal. Number two is identifying your defender. What I mean by that is what is stopping you from hitting that goal. So you want to lose two percent body fat in the next year. Okay great. What's going to stop us? Once we can achieve that we'll go in a more than in a second. Then you just start walking that 2 percent backwards. So you might have to go something like this. Look, every time I start working out really hard I always get hurt. Interesting. Okay great. So maybe instead of jumping really hard into an in high intensity interval training program. Knowing where to likely to hurt something or get burnt out or quit or whatever the defender is for you. Maybe we invest something right now which is maybe improving your flexibility or working on movement technique. Whatever is going to stop you from getting hurt or maybe we progress slower. So we don't get there. That will allow us to do the work necessary to hit that goal 12 months from now. Not two weeks from now. Not two months from now. Maybe that's not the case. Maybe you're like, no look. Hey, I move well. I feel like I'm in like decent shape. I've got enough muscle mass on me. We've talked in previous episodes why having insufficient muscle mass is sometimes detrimental for fat loss. So you check all that boxes. I don't get her very often. Right. I got equipment around. No problem. I've got the time in my schedule and I have enough muscle great. Well now we may be just split it up and say, look, we got 12 months. We got 2%. It's as simple as doing a half a percent per quarter of the year. And now all we're looking at is that number right. I don't have to necessarily get all these things done. I can go quarter half percent, half percent, half percent. You're going to get there. The other scenario that I laid out a second ago, it may be needs to look like something like this. Quarter one is going to be 0%. Like, whoa. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. You may not lose a pound for the next three months. We don't care. That's not the goal of these three months. I know that's the goal of this year. That's our major macroslake goal. We're going to get there. But to get there most effectively, we need to invest in working more with your car or a car proctor or whatever the thing is. Right. That will allow us to then go half a percent quarter two when we can really start training. But we're going to ramp into it. Quarter three, we're going to go another half a percent. And now we're halfway there. Quarter four, we've invested so much. You're ready to go. We're going to go hard. We're going to get that last one percent, that last quarter. And we're going to get there. And you won't be hurt. So that makes it very clear. And I can also envision how the precise structure of these intermediate goals would vary depending on what sort of adaptation one is pursuing. And I do remember from our previous episodes that fat loss itself is not an adaptation. It is a byproduct of other adaptations. So I just want to make sure that you know that I was paying attention. Right. It's committed to memory. Absolutely. Some goals such as fat loss are very quantifiable. And yet they might not be linear. Right. It's hard to know. You know, the assumption is if you ingest, you know, X fewer calories than or required per day than you'll lose X amount of weight. Some percentage from body fat. I think that cues up the idea that we need to build some flexibility into our thinking about these intermediate goals in order to just make sure that dopamine system is entethered to exact numbers. You know, because after all, a reduction to percent body fat for instance is really desire to achieve a different sort of overall body composition or recomposition. I don't know by the way that that's my exact goal. I think one of my goals is to be able to run a mile faster. And I'm sort of haunted by this experience of wanting to run across country and college and trying to walk on. We weren't to division one school, but the threshold for being considered for the team was you had to run a sub 10 minute to mile. Which turns out to be very, very fast. That's really hard. I did not do that. I didn't even come close. But, and I don't think that I could reasonably do that now. I'm not interested in committing to the kind of training required. The sacrifice isn't meaningful enough for me. Fair enough. But lowering one's mile time to run a mile by, I don't know, 10 percent. Seems like a reasonable goal across six months. Sure. Great. So in the case of a goal like that, clearly there are specific training programs. But this raises the issue of, what if I have other goals as well? And at what point do people having multiple goals start to set up collisions between goals? How do we know whether or not something is reasonable, not just on its own, but because of the other things that one has structured into their program? So being able to reduce a mile time by 10 percent in six months. Okay, maybe that's doable, maybe it's not. You can tell me, but also being able to double the amount that they can do for a single repetition, like extension for that matter. At the same time, that seems the Ocean-likeing compatible goals. Right. So a couple of things. Number one, the more specific and precise you can be with a single goal, the faster you will get there, generally. So in theory, if you had one thing you wanted to achieve, the best way to go about it is to focus on that. Give it the most priority. That doesn't mean you can't do anything else along the way you can, but you would want to focus on that. The more additional goals you bring in, the more distraction you're creating for that primary goal. Depending on what those goals are, you can actually do them at the same time. Some other combinations are less effective. Think about it like this. We went through those nine adaptations, and we went through them in a specific order on purpose. The closer those adaptations are together in that list, the more compatible they are to training each other. The further away, they become more challenging. So just to give a few examples, if you wanted to improve your speed and power, you could basically train those simultaneously. They would not in every other at all. In fact, since power is speed times force, it would be complementary. If you just walked down the line from there to strength, hey, same thing. If you get faster, that's going to aid in strength because force is mass times acceleration. So if you improve acceleration, you're contributing to strength. Same thing with power. So speed, power, and strength are generally very complementary. You can absolutely train all three of those, those at the same time have no issues. Getting into hypertrophy. Now we've got a little bit of distinction. If you're going to train strength and hypertrophy, as we talked about in that episode, at the base, those are going to be complementary. You add on some muscle, you're going to get stronger. You start training for strength. It's probably going to help you add on some muscle mass. As you get to the end of that spectrum, the overlap between the two starts to go away. So it's that if you truly wanted to maximize strength above everything else, if you continue to train for hypertrophy as well, that's going to take too many resources. Out of your recovery bin and you won't be able to do that. The inverse would also be the same. If you're training the maximum strength, you wouldn't be able to put it up volume on to get sufficient hypertrophy. So if you wanted to then combine speed with high-purchary, you're going farther away from each other, which means it's going to be more and more distraction. So the high-purchary training would cause a ton of fatigue. You wouldn't be able to go up max speed for your speed or power strength. So you're going to be compromising those results. Now speed training won't compromise your hypertrophy training because it's non-fatigating. Right? And so boom, here we have a little bit of an interference effect one way, but probably not the other. Let's move down the spectrum one more time and get into endurance. We won't go through all of these things. But you're getting that idea here. Oh, a little bit of a high-intensity intervals? Okay, cool. Now would that compromise my speed power or strength? Probably because there's a little bit of residual fatigue. If the volume was low enough, then you'd be fine. All you're worried about there is not necessarily like some sort of cellular mechanism. It's just simple fatigue. It is amount of energy expenditure versus is that compromising my recovery to come back. Would those first three or four of those speed power strength? And your fear with your ability to elevate your anaerobic capacity. Probably not. Almost surely, in fact, if you look at any of the literature on endurance training, you will see that speed power and strength almost always improve endurance. Right? And endurance training at it on top of strength can be detrimental. Can have a neutral effect. But generally doesn't help one get stronger by adding additional conditioning. Unless you're so unfit, you can't get through the volume needed in the strength training. One more example here, so we don't drag this out too far. In the case of something like, I want to lose fat. Well, hey, we don't have to worry about our parents. It doesn't really matter. If you're fatigued for your high-perch fee session, not a big deal. We're just trying to get some work done. If your high-perch fee session fatigued for me conditioning, it's cool because you've got the work done. So you don't have to worry about it so much. So really kind of depends on the actual goal and what you want to pay attention to is actually what are the chances of overlap, which means like what are the adaptations you get physiologically that cross over from one to the other. And then what are the ones that are actually going to start interfering? In fact, I have in my class, I have this giant matrix chart of interference effect. Going from adaptations through a whole bunch of systems, everything from like handling pH to lymphatic drainage to bone mental density, etc. And you can walk through these whole things and say, which ones actually have a positive effect? Which ones have a massive positive effect? And then which ones actually have a little bit of near-fairncy? Perhaps if you guys are nice enough, we could throw that into a newsletter or something, some PDF or something to it. I think that would be immensely valuable. I think some of that more extensive information went laid out in grid form like that. It's easier to use for time. So we should do well now we've said it. So we didn't say what we would do at a separate house. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a terrific idea. The idea that items closer on to each other on the list of those nine different adaptations are going to be easier to achieve in parallel than items further apart. Makes perfect sense. And what I heard was that there's a few caveats that might seem minor, but they're actually quite important, such as anything that is relatively low intensity and doesn't in-peed recovery. Can probably be included as a parallel goal. So some speed work in conjunction with some long duration cardio work. No, it's even though we're talking about number two on that list and number nine on that list. In that case, the long duration of endurance, even if it's low intensity, may actually interfere with the speed if the volume gets too high. If you're talking about, I went on a 30 minute jog. For most people that it's totally fine. What we're really talking about here is when the miles start piling up. The time really starts getting there in combination with some of the things the factors we've talked about earlier, which is exercise choice. So more eccentric landing-based exercise choice is running. For example, there's more likely to interfere than cycling. Because you're not landing. Swimming is low on packs. So if you're going to do those things, you can hedge your bets a little bit by choosing an exercise choice that is less impactful. Again, if we're literally, because there's oftentimes confusing here, it was like, oh, don't do 10 minutes on the treadmill before you lift. You're going to cut, oh, like time out. The warm-up is fine. We're really talking about probably more than 30-plus minutes at higher than 60 percent. Like random numbers, something like that depends on the person, et cetera. But it has to be a decent chunk. Again, you can actually fix that by then-diss consuming calories. You can also fix that by making sure everything else in the hidden invisible stressor bucket is improved. So that's just like one of our tricks that we'll get into when we get into the recovery. Is you don't necessarily need to have to reduce your training if you just ramp up your recovery. I'd like to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor Athletic Greens.

I'm going to take the liberty of assuming that most people fall into one of either three bins in terms of their goals. Again, most people, certainly they're going to people that lie outside these bins. I think if you pulled 100 people or 100,000 or a million people as to what their major goals were and working out, they'd say, that's you so nicely listed out as before, aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity. But that one in three really kind of sit higher than most people would like to perhaps even admit. They want to look good, which usually means they want to lose some fat, gain some muscle in specific places. I realize there are folks out there who want to gain a lot of muscle, just muscle everywhere. But I think most people would like to have a little more shape here, or a little more muscle there to either balance out their aesthetic or to accentuate certain parts of their physique. And they would probably like to shave off some subcutaneous fat. Although there are those exceptionally lean people out there, and they exist too. I think it would be gain muscle in specific places, lose fat, and do it in a way that also provides some booth to their health span and longevity. I would say that that might even be 50% of people out there. Again, I'm taking the liberty of guest-domaining. Another bin I would venture is interested in getting stronger and putting on more muscle. Certainly there are a number of people that are interested in doing that. And that could even be more muscle all over, or more muscle with some accentuation to certain areas where they happen to be weaker, or less less developed as it were. And then the third bin be people that really enjoy cardiovascular work. Oh, I should say the second bin probably care about their longevity, also, but it's not really foremost. And like, yeah, I feel great now, and I will live to, you know, a live to be whatever, but I only want to do it if I get that much muscle. We know these kinds of folks. Yeah, I don't know this whole in my class every year when I ask, what you guys all lift, and of course, I make them put their hand up. Like, you guys are in my class, you're going to put your hand up, let you lift weights. And then I ask, why do you train? And like, health is long-term health is like on the list, and they all, like, I'm like, any of you that's selected health are liars. Like, you're 20 to 25, you are not exercising for health. You're exercising because you want to look a certain way or get stronger. Once you get past that undergraduate age, though, the actual desire to live longer and better actually becomes pretty real. Yeah, I think that there are people who want to feel better. They know that exercise and the results for exercise can make them feel better. Yeah, that second bin tends to be more focused on the aesthetic change. It seems or being strong. And then the third category, I think our people, I know a lot of folks like this who really enjoy what are normally considered endurance type activities. And here, I just want to highlight again what you so beautifully illustrated in previous episodes that you can gain a lot of endurance even using weights or machines. It just depends on how you use them, right? It's not about the exercise about how you perform them, et cetera. And you again, beautifully provided all those details as to how to create endurance, regardless of equipment standards, et cetera. But that third category, seem to be people who enjoy running, cycling, swimming, hiking, dancing activities that they can do for long periods of time. They often will involve some sort of skill that is based on improving motor patterns. So maybe not so much stride, but certainly for people that are really love tennis. Yeah. People that love a sport like golf, right? Do they want to be able to not just walk you know, they want to walk the 18 holes, they want to have a great golf swing, et cetera. I'm not a golf player, so forgive me if my nomenclature is off. So I was like, golfers. Yeah, golfers. You know, they're like golf. Oh, god, you don't play golf. You wouldn't call golf player. I played manager golf a few times. That's about it. Although Stanford does have a beautiful golf course. I'm told I should learn how to play golf. I can't play golf. You come up. I'll play. I'll say how. I get me on the course. Of course. From my lab. So category one, I think, is a significant fraction of people. Yeah. So as we lay out these different ways to assess goals. And as we approach the structure of a program, as you know, we can just go through this program as you'll tell us. If we could perhaps touch back to those every once in a while, I, again, I'm taking the liberty of assuming that we will. We will net about 80 to 90% of people out there. Again, those categories. Being people who want to lose some fat. Maybe build some muscle in specific areas on their body. And really want to be healthy. They want to feel great. And they want to have a long health spin. Okay. And life spin. And when I live a long time feeling great. Second category, people want to build more muscle in strength. Sure, they don't want to damage their health. But that's not their main focus. Their main focus is on building muscle in strength. And then that third category of people who really want to do more endurance type work feel great and strong doing it. But not because they can, you know, carry heavy weights while they're doing it. But rather they can feel vital and they can push harder for longer. And maybe even translate that to some of the more recreational type activities. Or sports like tennis and things that are more long duration. And then you're going to have to do a lot of things. So that's a lot of things. So those three categories. Maybe we could call those been A, B and C for sake of today's discussion. I think if you're willing to embrace. Yeah. I think that will be informative toward our listeners in a way that simply not assuming what people's different goals are might not be able to accomplish. Said differently. Hopefully by doing that, people will derive a lot more from the description of the program that you're going to give us. Now I am certain that I want to let you return to your list of the five things that people need to consider when establishing a exercise program. Yeah, great. Let's do that. I also do want to acknowledge point you've brought up. Accuracy doesn't mean just lifting weights. That's my background. That's what I spend my time on. So I sorted the fault to examples in that category. But it doesn't have to be that. You've articulated plenty of other ways we can get. Amazing forms of exercise that that I've nothing to do with lifting weights. So for those folks in and what it was it been C or three. I can remember we go A is again muscle loose fat, B healthy now and forever. Right. B is get stronger gain muscle. Don't damage your health, but not really focus on health in the immediate term. And then. Right. And then the first thing that you see is want to play or do endurance type activities. And quote unquote, feel strong doing it. So have more vigor to be able to do that longer and maybe with more attention to skill, et cetera. And of course, also want to improve their health. Well, you've effectively done as you've given us three different avatars with three different goals. Right. So the next step for each person or group is going to be to identify their defenders. So we get that we got to close the loop on this smart thing. So in each case, they have either chosen that goal based on their personal preference or perhaps they did our fitness testing protocol and realize they need to gain strength. So whether the reason they chose to be in buckets B or A or C was because of our protocol or it's this personal preference, it really doesn't matter. They still want to go through this process of laying out their goals and making sure that again they are specific. Right. So let's go through Ben C, which is a great one. So you want to have more energy and you want to feel stronger when you're doing your kiteboarding. You want to feel stronger when you finish your round of tennis round of golf game of tennis. Okay. Great. That's a different strength. Absolutely. See, I hear I know you're saying, though, amazing. So that goal needs to be specific to that. Right. So it would be hard to make a goal like I want to feel better at the end of my round. Boy, what that depends on too many other factors. A better goal would be something like this. I want to be able to run this two mile loop that I do around my neighborhood. And I want to do it and have a lower heart rate at the end. Or I want to be able to get my heart rate back, my heart rate recovery back faster. Amazing. That will probably align with you feeling quote unquote stronger with it. Right. So I did the same course and either I can do it at the same speed and it's not nearly as hard or I can go faster, whichever one. It doesn't matter, but that would be an example of a specific goal. The other buckets you laid out kind of already half specific goals like I want to get stronger. Well, that's going to be the goal. The other one is going to be, you know, I want to lose some fat. Okay. That's kind of the goal is sort of implicit in that. It's the other people where you just like, I don't want to care about that. I want to be able to serve the great waves and then not feel exhausted afterwards. All right. Cool. Well, then you still should pick a metric. That is not that activity, maybe, because it won't be within your control depending on the waves and the temperature and all this stuff that you can use as a proxy to say, if I were to do something that represented me feeling probably better when I served what would that be and it's not perfect, but it would be still as specific as you could get. You still want to make sure it's measurable. Again, this example might be something like, you're going to go to the pool and time how long it takes you to swim eight millimeters or something, right. It's attainable thing you'll set a goal that's realistic and timely. I'm going to improve by 5% in the next two months. Okay. Cool. That probably falls in the realm. And then you're making the assumption that if you did that, you'll probably feel better when you go out to do your primary activity, which is safe serve. The reality of it is, every time we work with an actual athlete, that's what we do. At least don't come to us to lift weights. They don't come to us to get stronger. They come to us because they want to play better. And they want to stand to feel more. What we're trying to convince them of is, if you do this thing in the gym, then that should translate into you being better at your sport, recovering faster, being less injured. But it's still just a proxy. And so that's all you're doing with these other non-specific goals, especially when they're performance based goals. And we didn't package it that way. But that's really what you talked about for Ben C. there. It is a performance based goal. I want to be able to perform when I'm in the field. And my brain, that's a sport and your brain, it's when you're at yoga class. It's the same thing. Like we've said this earlier in our series that if you have a body, you're an athlete. I want to prepare your body so that it can do exactly what you want it to do. You then get to have the choice of what you ask it to do. You call it a sport, you call it your Saturday, hike with your family. I don't really care. It's the same thing. You get control of your body performing the way you want it to perform. And that's what this whole thing is about. Great. So now that we've covered, I think, as much as we need to, regarding assessing and choosing a goal. I want to get back this idea of identifying your defender. So you really need to think carefully about what is stopping you from hitting those goals. And so you're forecasting a little bit. You're also going back into your own personal history. Right. Do you have history of knee pain? Do you have a history of working too much? Do you have a history of a lot of travel? Do you have a history of getting sick a lot? What are these things that are happening that are going to stop you from hitting your goal? A couple of examples I've already laid out. So we don't need to go too much longer here. But in the case of somebody who is in maybe a bin A, right, which is, I want to lose some fat. Maybe gain a little bit of muscle. Okay. What's stopping you from the strength and conditioning side? Is it the fact that you can't train consistent enough? Is it a fact that when you go to train, you don't know what to do. Is it a fact that when you go to train, you train your ass off and you're getting results. Okay. Great. All three of these different scenarios are going to result. And different programs because they have different reasons you're failing. And that is really critical. Instead of just going, I want to fat loss program and picking one up on the internet. It may not actually be addressing the point of failure for you. So the sooner you can choose your programs based on why you're failing. The sooner you'll start getting results. You have to run a little bit of a critical analysis there. And it can be something scientific and it could be a measurement. And it also could just be you thinking about, you've tried this in the past and why didn't it work. I wasn't that interesting. Okay. Tell me more about why it was an interesting. I just, I'm not really into machines. And that's all I had. Okay. Great. I love it. I loved the gym. I was at it. And I was getting results. But it was so far away. Okay. Interesting. Why did you stop before? Why didn't it work? Or if it did work in the past? Amazing. Let's go back to something similar. But has your life changed at all? Is there anything different about now than when it worked three years ago? Yes, no. If not, maybe we run it right back. If it is, okay, we're going to sort of predict those things. And you want to work. If I have to be what I'm saying is throughout this entire ten-step process is going to be. You want to make sure that there are the non-negotiables that are in your life that you know are going to be ahead of your fitness program. And you want to work with those things not against them. Right? Because life will win when it comes to your children, when it comes to your job. Life is going to win. You're going to have to give up something. It's going to take some hard work. But we want to fight the right battles for most people, right? Even for professional athletes. We get this all the time. This is like they have nothing else to do with train, right? And like we'll hold on now. They're getting traded. They have agents to deal with. They may not have a contract. They have families. But they think life will get in the way I promise. And so you want to fight the battles that you can win. Not ones that you're going to lose. And so that's really what this game is about. So if the battle is, hey, my job is super hectic. Okay, great. We're going to come up with a different strategy. That's more flexible, maybe. I'm still going to hold you to the fire. I'm not going to be easier on you. But we're just not going to try to set up a situation where you have to do this workout Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Because you know your job is on the road and you're the provide all the income for your family and your job. Okay. Whatever the thing is, right? That's what we really want to identify. So when I say identify your defenders, you need to run a little bit of a critical analysis on this. And a little bit of a tool I'll use for this is a modification of another system I stole from Kenny Kane, which is what we call a quadrant system. So you can imagine everything your life goes into one of four buckets. All right. Now bucket one, I'm just going to call business. And this is anything to do with your job income sort of all those things. Bucket two is relationships. So again, this could be family or love lie. Like anything that we would call relationships. Social connection purpose. But anything like that. Bucket three is your fitness and bucket four is your recovery. So one of the first steps we take is we walk through this and we say, all right, you have 10 points total. And you get to distribute these 10 points across the four areas. So not 10 each, you get 10 total. And as we walk through and we say, right now, where are you giving your points? And we could do this right now for you if you'd like or I could make up a scenario. Do I do it? Sure. Great. So Andrew, right now in the last month. If you had 10 points total, those four categories, where would you be distributing the most points, which category and how many points would that be? Business, my work business work job sort of all those things and how many out of 10 which doesn't I should say ever quite feel like work running a laboratory and doing the podcast doesn't ever really feel like work in the traditional sense, but it's career. It's it involves relationships, but it certainly doesn't enhance my fitness except of my vocal cords and recovery. So with those notes there, I would say four or four to five. You pick five five fair. That's the most common number. Five business five. Again, I'm typical which makes me happy. You nailed it. One of the few ways which I've been accused of being normal. I think five for business. Okay. What's the next highest and what's that score? I do invest in relationships. I would say, Does that have to be around. Can it be a has a whole integer. Oh, yeah, a whole integer. Two. Two. All right, we're seven out of ten here. So would you say it is fair that you spend roughly two and a half percent of your it's not necessarily time. It's energy time focused sort of all these things. Two and a half times as much on your business as you do in your relationships. It varies depending on what's going on. It feels a little skewed in the direction of business. So I might want to adjust to a four three ratio there. Maybe not. But I'm going to hold to five. Okay. Two. Business relationships and then just for sake of example. And because, you know, this doesn't seem like a exceedingly precise measure. It can have some slopp. Of course. Okay. Where would you put fitness and recovery? I definitely put energy into fitness. So I'm going to give that also a two. Yep. Which leaves one for recovery. Great. That what you just laid out is again, the most quintessential split you could have. In fact, you run this game on everyone. They're going to come up with basically the same answer unless they don't work out or whatever. So a couple of rules here. Recovery must be at minimum half of your fitness allocation. And in your case, two to one, you're fine. I think I say has to be half. It has to be five out of ten point. No. That doesn't leave much for anything else. I would like it to be minimum 20% of the total, which means two out of ten. Now, when I say recovery, I don't simply mean muscle. I mean, you need personal time. You need meditation. You need sleep. You need to go to a concert and get out and see people. And so like whatever the things that give you energy back, right? Some folks that's personal time, some folks that's social time. Whatever that means to you, right? Yeah. I actually get a lot of energy from my work. Great. So you know, that's why some of these numbers are a little bit. You can always the kind of cloak the underlying dynamics. So here's what we do from this game. We look at that and we say, if that's our split Andrew, five, three, two, one. Five, five, two, one. Five, five, two, one. I'd love to be able to put three in relationships just because, but then I need 11 out of, uh, right? So here's the fun game we play. You're currently at this and you don't get the actual 11. You have to stay at 10. Your 10 is different than my 10, maybe, right? But 10 is 10. Or just whatever the maximum you can actually do. It's you. So if we went back to our training goal, whatever that goal was for you. And we went back to our defenders. So we would look at this score now and say, is three out of 10. Fitness was three, right? Fitness is two. So it's five to two. Sorry, one. Is two out of 10 sufficient to hit that training goal in that time frame you described? And let's say you said, I want to hit a new PR in my mile six months from now. Yeah, for for simplicity's sake and also because it's largely two. I'm going to put myself in in what I referred to as Ben A earlier. Great. And my by-fapurcentage is okay. It's in the range that I would like what I would like to bring down a little bit. I gain a little bit muscle here and there. Keep, keep regain some endurance and certainly certainly my immediate and long-term health are extremely important to me. Great. So then the question in the may answer, maybe, yes, that this is the optimal split for you. If it is not, then we have to make a choice. We either alter the goal or the timeline to make it realistic. Or we alter our quadrant. And then if we're going to alter our quadrant, the next step is critical going to import. We need a list of very specific life actions that we're going to take that allows that split to happen. So if you said, for example, I want to put three into relationships. Great. What specific life actions are you going to take to pull one from fitness? You can't pull any from recovery or one from business. And then we don't have to actually answer this as, you know, too personal. I know you don't like making these things about you because, right? Did that's the other reason to do it. And it is a diabolical trick to make it to insist that these be whole integers. Because I would have done, you know, like a 4.5 for business and a 2.5 for relationships. But obviously you write the rules on this, not me. So you would just walk that list. Okay. And then like, I promised to not work after 7 p.m. Thursday through Sunday or whatever the thing is right, I promise I'm going to make sure that I don't start work before 8 a.m. Or whatever, whatever, right? No more trips. Just make those things specific and measurable. Not just like I'm going to work less. That's never going to go. What is the very specific life action you're going to take? There's going to be alarm that goes off Tuesday night at 4 p.m. And no matter what we at barbell shrugged, we used to have a little shirt that was like D3, AT which is like drop everything in train. Which means at 3 p.m. the afternoon, no matter what's happening, we dropped everything in train. Because that was like when you start a business and you're going, things just run away from you, right? And it's just sort of like man, it's not my company, but those guys are like, we are a string, the decision company and we're not training. So we had to just make this hard rule and it was just like a little thing that came up and it was Easier to say drop everything in train. Three o'clock. There we go. I like this drop D, E everything A and blank. Like you can be drop everything and you know, pick your favorite. Totally. You pick everything in the lead. Pick the relevant read. Yeah, absolutely. You know, I really miss reading for pleasure. I put that under recovery and put everything in breath and with that. Oh, and breathe, you are saying, oh, and breathe. I was saying, read. I said that too. Yeah, because for me, reading is actually is both recovery and relationship. Because it oftentimes in my relationships, I've insist not insisted. I certainly didn't insist. We've had a format of reading the same book in parallel. Oh, great. Yeah, not necessarily side by side, but the same book in parallel and then discussing it. It's a wonderful practice or listening to the same audio book. Yeah. It works well. You can do drop everything in play. Mm-hmm. You're just going to go do something fun. You're going to play video games. You're going to go play with your kid. You're going to do what it played with your dog. It doesn't, it doesn't have to actually be played, but play it to you. You can signify personal time. Right. It doesn't really matter. So yeah, that's a, I really like to drop everything in blank. Um, get away with that. You probably shouldn't have more than what two or three of those overall. Pretty much like one is the one to two, maybe. Grace. Where you want to go after that. So the idea is then to redistribute the numbers on this list, but through a very concrete action. I like this drop everything in blank because it, um, speak to the non-negotiable aspect of it. Has to be. It's life will get pushed. Right. It's not a fine time to. Right. Correct. It's not in next year. I'm going to correct. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. When you make, when you, when you put those things, those things you might as well just. Don't even throw any of those. Because not going to happen. Yeah. You're talking to somebody who loves rules. Um, because when they are non-negotiable rules, they provide this incredible organizing force for the brain. Yeah. It's really a neuroscience thing in my mind. Totally. And actually, we did an episode on happiness where you find that once people make a decision, if they eliminate the possibility of other decisions, like literally the hatches close that is it. For the boat that the, the, the, the rates of. Subjective happiness. It immediate launch from happiness over time. Go way way up. Yeah. And so I'm convinced that the nervous system doesn't like to keep the the valves on these dopamine circuits open. Actually, think it diminishes from the reward component. And there are actually some data on this. Anyway, I don't want to take us off track. But the last part of this, what we do then is we take that quadrant and we take that list. And then you're going to print it. Physically, and you're going to put it in two places. This could actually be on your phone. You're actually printing screen shot. You can be the background of your phone. So every time you click on your phone, you immediately see that quadrant. Like, it's a very clear reminder of like, what are my priorities today, right? Just a simple little picture. I also like to put it in your place of failure. So for a lot of people that is like on their laptop or write about their workstation, right? It's like the thing that's going to lose and beat your fitness is your job. Typically, right? Or it's on your TV. It's on your Netflix control. No, sorry Netflix, no fans. But you don't even like, is whatever the thing is that you fail for. I play too many video games great there. I work too much. Okay, great. And you put it there. And you can just go to the last component. It has to also be in the hands of somebody who can hold you accountable. Right? wife training partner, business partner, whatever. So it's like, hey Andrew, like you promised you were going to do extra self. Why are you still here? You committed to this. You got to get out of here. Someone who will like be like, no, no, it's drop everything and read. It's a clock. You're supposed to be reading. You got to go. You're going to check picking on that. Check bank and every week. Check back in. It doesn't matter. And then you can adjust. It's fine. You can always change the system. But that has to now change. You got to print the new one and now it's a whole new promise you've made to yourself. So you've got to be able to hold yourself accountable to those things. It's got to be flexible enough to where it's realistic. It can't be. I'm not going to work after six o'clock every day. Maybe it's just three days a week. Maybe it's on Saturday. I promise to work for the first two hours. So I don't work Saturday night. Oh, whatever. Or the inverse. You got it. You can come up with a million examples here. So that's the system we used to make sure that we have now a properly identified where we're going. We found a roadmap to that. And now we know exactly how we're going to stay on track. I have to take this opportunity to add one more thing to our drop everything list. And you gave the example of deer, which is maybe drop everything and read or drop everything and relax or another example. I have to add a deal, which is drop everything. And this is for you, Lex. Love. Actually, one of the advantages of having a dog or having children is that the drop everything and love is often enforced by the faces of those that you love. They just show up in whatever space you happen to be in. Especially if you work from home. I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker. Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better. To help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your media and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, etc. But you don't know what to do with that information. Inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course, but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can visit inside tracker.com slash human to get 20% off any of inside tracker's plans. Again, that's inside tracker.com slash human to get 20% off. Let's move on to the next one, shall we? Number three here is going to be what I call calendar or sort of timeframe. So it's going back a little bit and saying you've decided on this goal and you've identified the defenders. Now we need to come up with a realistic timeframe for how long it's going to take to accomplish that goal. And when you do that, you need to look at your life schedule. And what I mean by that is, do you have important deadlines coming up? Do you have a holiday? Do you have a trip? Do you have travel? Do your children have something coming up? You need to take all that information and I literally lay out a calendar and I write all those dates in a physical calendar first. And the reason I'm suggesting this is you want to work your training backwards around that. As we've been discussing, life will win. If you try to plan a training program that is five days a week, 90 minutes a day, and all of a sudden you look two weeks from now and you realize you've got a grant deadline and then you've got to take two days to go to ask, It's just foolish. You're going to fail and then you're going to quit and you're going to be like, Man again, my training program failed. So you need to figure out what are the non-negotiables are in that business quadrant and just not be foolish. All right. So let's imagine you're going to plot out, say, a 12 week training phase and you want to, you've decided on this goal. And then you look and you realize in the middle of this 12 week span, week five is really hectic and chaotic or you realize that this is a quarter in which something important is do. Maybe we'll want to either adjust the goal or what we really do in this step is going on to actually step number four, which is choose the number of days per week you can exercise and the length in terms of amount of time, you can truly afford to train. I would rather you underestimate that than overestimated. So again, you look at the calendar, you put all these non-negotiables, the deadline you cannot move in the calendar. And then you say, look, based on this, realistically, I can conservatively train three days a week for 60 minutes total. And that includes the time I walk into the gym, my warm up, my down regulation breathing at the end, and then me getting back either in the shower and back because really now it's maybe 90 minutes by the time you traveled, you transition, you picked back up on work, you shoured, you ate, etc. That time just runs away from you. And also it was a two and a half hour thing, even though it was a 45 minute workout. So you really need to figure that thing out. If you're a few weeks in and you realize, oh, actually, I have a little more time I thought, you can always train more, you do another thing you can add up. Well, you don't want to do a set up a program that is requiring you to do certain exercises on one day, or certain styles of training on another. And then you constantly miss one of those days. I thought I could do four days a week, but one day a week something's getting pulled out. That's just going to keep you off schedule. It's going to make you feel like a failure and you're going to run into problems with your training. So schedule three, if you are sure you can get three and if there's an extra day, we can always do other fun stuff. All right. So that's really stuff three and four. Figure out your life events over the course of this time. How many days a week can you train, and how long in terms of minutes for workout? Notice we haven't selected a single exercise yet. We haven't worried about how heavy rest intervals. All those modifiable variables. You don't need to pick those later. First, where are we going? Second, how are we going to get there? Which is the quadrant and identifying of defenders. And now the third is what are the restrictions? I need to play some myself in terms of program design based on how often and how long I can work out. That is going to allow you to go back to some of the previous episodes and go, man, you gave us all kinds of ideas. How do I know which one to choose? This is your answer. You're going to choose based upon the limitations of time and frequency. So if you've already said, we're in this imagine we're in bucket A or bucket C. It doesn't matter. And you go, look, the most I can afford with where I'm at with what's going on in my life. A three days week, well we automatically know we're going to have to start training choosing a training style. That's limited to three days a week. Don't worry about the four or five days. Those are off the table. And now we play a restrictions. It kind of goes back to that concept of, I think it's one of your podcast, Jessica Choco. This is like, hey, structure gives us actually some freedom. So by creating some restrictions here, we're a little more free to go. I only actually have to choose between A and B rather than sitting down and going, man, there's all 20 hours into this exercise podcast thing. There's so many options between a pick. Well, you create a little bit of restriction and now it's easier to go. I only option is A or B. And there we go. So that's number four. That's three and four. At that point, once we're good there, now what you want to do is go to step number five, which is actually select your exercises or your movements. And this can be as simple as selecting like a kettlebell swing or running or swimming. It could be your entire exercise mode. What you want to do with exercise selection here is make sure that you're balancing those exercises across the whole week, not within necessarily every workout. So if you have four days a week, five days a week, you want to look at the exercise selection and say, okay, I need to have some one of a reasonable balance between movement patterns or muscle groups or front and back side aside, however you're thinking of it just across that week. So again, say we're on a three day program and we're in either of the buckets, any of the buckets really. And we say, okay, great. Maybe it's not ideal if all I select is cycling every day. That's not a lot of balance. I don't notice any there's no upper body work there. There's no torso work. There's no other position. So maybe I'm going to really focus on cycling. So I will do only cycling two days a week, but that third day I need to pick something for the other movement areas. And that's going to make sure you stay in a reasonable balance. If you have an exercise that you like, great. If you have exercise, you have access to. Again, maybe the gym is a giant pain in the ass. And so you can say, look, it's too far away. The closest one is 45 minutes there and back. So maybe I'm going to restrict myself to only kettlebell and vans and running because I can do those in my house. Awesome. We've actually created some freedom because we gave ourselves some restriction. And now we just have to figure out how am I going to give some movement patterns somewhat balance across my three days. So really when it comes to exercise choice, it is selecting the patterns that you know how to execute. Giving yourself again some one of the balance between the muscles and the joints and the movement patterns. Making sure that you are specifically targeting any muscle group or movement that you want. So making sure you want to improve muscle size and your glutes. You better make sure some of the exercises you're doing at least one day a week. You're feeling it in your actual glutes. So you can check that box. It doesn't have to be every exercise. It probably shouldn't. It doesn't even have to be every single day. But make sure it's checked off somewhere on that list. And the last one is, is there a strategy in which you can progress it? So if you're like, I'm just going to do body weight exercises. Okay, great. Well, how are you going to progress those? And the case is like body weight. It's really hard to add load. Maybe you can go to weight vest on or something. But then maybe you don't have that or that's an extra thing or that can only go so far. So what's my progression strategy going to be? Well, in this case, maybe you just increase the complexity by going from two legs, like say a body weight squat to a single leg squat. Or you just increase repetitions. Or you increase time again. What, my point is your progression strategy will be based upon the restrictions that you placed based on availability and things like that. The last thing I would recommend here in terms of exercise progression to make sure that you can continue to do these things. While lowering your risk of injury both in the short term and long term is to progress your exercise complexity in this this fashion. So make sure number one you can do the exercise properly with the systems. So let's imagine a scenario where we're going to try to squat. So give yourself, put your hands on a bench or something like that. Now can you execute that squat perfectly with the system? So you're holding on to something. Okay, great. If you can't, then don't progress past that. Don't go now to a barrel back squat if you can't do it correctly when you have a systems. That's the same most people can do that. Okay, great. Now you can move on to the next step, which is can you do it well without assistance. So this would be body weight only. Check. Cool. We're good there. Okay, now you can go ahead and move on. Can you do it well with an added eccentric load? So in this particular case, if I, if we're learning to squat, we can do it well when I hold on to something. That's great. Now I can do it well with this. My body weight. Now if I put a little bit of weight on, whether it's a kettle ball in the front like a goblet squat or dumbbells to the side or whatever you want to do. Can I lower it and go all the way down and stay in perfect position? If you can do that, great. You're allowed to go to the next step, which is can you hold it isometrically? So can you go all the way down and then hold that bottom position? What you don't want to do is start adding load or speed or fatigue. If you're going down to the bottom position of the movement and you're out of control. We really want to avoid this. So I want you to show me you can go down and you can lower the weight under control. You can hold it in that position under control. If we're clear there, now we can add the concentric portion. Right. You can now go ahead, you can lower it, you can hold that position of most danger. Now you can move up at whatever speed we want. We are all good there. Once you can show me those things, you can add the last two steps, which are now speed. If you choose to. And I'll ask one which is fatigue. Right. I would really discourage people from doing exercises too fatigue, especially with a moderate or high load. Unless you can promise me you can do these first six steps. If you can, you can basically go hog wild with your training and your chances of injury are very low. Again, both acute injury as well as long term injury, which is just sort of like my joints ache and all of a sudden my shoulder hurts and things like that. That's really what I'm looking for. Once you're clear there, you can train pretty hard. I really like this because recently I was showing somebody how to use it. In this case it was a hack squat machine. I know that they were a very timid of getting into a deep squat position. And they cited a previous knee injury, which is long since healed. Right. But even with proper foot placement and everything, you just tell that they were getting ginger about it as they approached that bottom position. But over time, with pauses at the bottom, they've become very comfortable. And now I share going well below 90 degrees. Angle between you know, femur and lower like. So it was clear that it wasn't something range of motion limited or it was just it was a mental thing, but a logical one for them. Now, after what you just said, I think a better strategy that I could have used would have been to have them get into that position, just no way to do all. Maybe nothing on the sled. And then slowly working out from there as opposed to doing what we did in our case, which was to just convince them that they were much stronger than they thought they were. We eventually got there, but I'm realizing that there was far too much mental anguish involved in that process. Yeah. This whole progression, by the way, this can all happen in one session. If you can check the boxes like in that example, you may have been fine to jump there. It may have just been a, hey, you're fine here. Get through it. Oh, okay. This whole progression might take two years. I mean, this really depends on your background. If you actually have injury history, your comfort, your confidence, like all these things. So you don't need to worry about rushing through that progression. You don't need to get all the way to the end if you don't want to, especially with speed and things like that. But again, it can't happen. It doesn't have to be like, well, it's a month of this month. Like, no, if they feel great and you can go through one to seven and five minutes, then you're good to go. Number six. Number six now is just order. So you know how many days per week you're going to work out. You know how long they're going to take. You've selected all the exercises you need to get done. You've balanced that across the week. Now you just need to put them in order. And the easy answer here is generally, do what's most important first in the workout. There is some minor interference effect of some other things there, but read the reality of it is, if you do the priority first, you're probably going to be okay. So whether this priority is a muscle group. So in the example, you want to make sure your glutes get trained. Maybe do it first. If you're trying to maximize your back squat, you may not want to do a bunch of glue exercises to fatigue first. But that's not the priority we picked. We picked a different one, which is buckets A, B, and C. Okay, great. By doing it first, you told me the priority was to make sure I do something for my glutes. And then I would also like to get my back squat a little bit stronger or whatever. Okay, fine, the same thing could be done for your endurance training. You could do your endurance training before you're lifting. If you understand that means you might be compromising your lifting quality of the workout a little bit, but you might be fine with that. If you say the endurance work is more important right now. Amazing. You don't know the answer to that though. If you hadn't gone through steps one through four. And that's why those things are critical. So it makes what we call chaos management, which is things happen in the moment. I don't know what to do. What should I choose. That decision becomes really clear because you can always go back to the beginning of my priority was this. Then therefore that's my choice today. So it provides a very simple set of instructions for when the workout gets cut short when your workout has to be in a hotel and any number of things that pop up in real life, whether again you're an athlete or not, athlete either way, life will get in the way at some point. And to have rules and a system that says when this happens I go right back to this and that's my choice done. I'm moving on. Not a decision to make here. It's already been determined a week ago five weeks ago. We're off and rolling. So the order again is pretty simple. Just put the one that is most important first. Now I know you like to do legs on Monday. That's great. I actually love that too. I do the same thing generally because to me that's almost always the most important thing. If I miss a bicep workout, I'm probably fine. But I really don't like missing the big movement pattern. So I make sure that those happen on day to 10 to be more stable for me. Mondays are generally pretty stable. Things get chaotic as the week moves along for me. Others might be the opposite, right? Others might want to go, hey, I'm actually going to keep Monday as my flexible day or off day because I like to get a lot of my work done. Get that clear. So I can now, oh, sure. Like work it around you. Some people love to train on Saturdays because it's their most free. Some people hate it. Sure. You tell me what is the biggest priority and when are you the most fresh Monday to say it doesn't matter depends on your work schedule. Maybe you work the weekends. I don't know. Right. You decide what day of the week? Are you generally the most consistent? The most consistent schedule and the most consistent energy. And do the thing that is most important on that day. It doesn't matter Monday to day day one day three. We were sort of talking about this earlier, but you actually don't even have to do a week schedule. Our brains tend to like to go year month week, but a lot of folks will even just run this thing in terms of like a seven or nine days schedule. In fact, we ran a nine day training schedule for one of my major league baseball players. And he's eight or so years in his career and he's hitting all time PRs in velocity. And he's very, very good. And it was a nine day training cycle. And we ran that for the entire season. So it doesn't have to be a seven days split, but it tends to work for a lot of people because most people have a fairly consistent schedule across the seven days. So pick the thing that is most important to do it first and do it on the day of the week that is most consistent for you, terms of schedule and energy. I really like what you're describing. I should just say that one of the reasons I put legs on Monday is because I tend to get enough sleep on the weekends. I generally get enough sleep during the middle of the week, but oftentimes things will come up. I can be pretty sure, however, that I've quote unquote caught up on my sleep on the weekend. So it's no shame of catching up on sleep is a little dicey scientifically, but tend to be pretty rested by Monday morning. And actually my week begins on Sunday. And Sundays are when I get my long form cardio. So those two are really non-negotiable. And the reason that long form cardio is on Sunday is that it can take many different forms. It can take a hike with a way to invest. It can take a the form of a jog. It can be done with other people. It can be family time. It can be time with friends and so on. And that's pretty hard to do during the middle of the week or pretty hard to ensure at least for me. I also find that by book ending the week with some non-negotiable days of training on Sunday. Monday, then if the week gets busy Tuesday, Wednesday or even sometimes Thursday with travel and things like that, one can sort of catch up toward the weekend. It's not ideal. I mean, ideally it's spaced out. But really, this isn't about what I do. This is really just to underscore the principle you described, which is I have a very clear sense. Now over three decades or so of training and three decades or so of being involved in academics and science and work of when I tend to be most rested. When I tend to have some flexibility in my schedule and also when I'm trying to combine fitness with some of my social engagements, which is actually quite fun. One thing I noticed that the four boxes that you mentioned before work relationships, fitness and recovery, some of them do have some crossover. They all do. You know, a hike with family or friends is both relationship and fitness and so on. But I love the principle. Because anything that can add consistency as you pointed out is going to greatly increase the probability of reaching one's goals. That sort of an obvious one. But in an earlier episode, you also said something that I wrote down and is really still ringing in my mind, especially now, which is that consistency always beats intensity. Yeah, absolutely. We used to do a thing. When I was training NFL players for the combine many years ago, where Saturdays were supposed to be the day they came in and we did the most regeneration. So this is when they get bodywork done and we do hot cold contrast and sort of all these things. And our attendance was like 1%. Nobody showed up. We're a massage. Nobody showed up. Well, seems like it. But remember, I love a good massage. Of course. But remember, you're 18 years old. You're likely to be getting millions of dollars hand to you in the next few weeks or months. And he's not referring to me by the way. Yeah. I'm actually quite older than 18. And I'm not getting handed millions of dollars each week. Right. So I would think that. But those folks like they recover super fast. They've never really had that and also like Friday night. Kind of enticing. And so nothing was there. And the strategy then was what if we instead of having a important hard training day on Saturday? We transition and it is only things they want to do. So we basically identified what are the things in training you love the most? And let's do those Saturdays. And it turns out for those folks no surprise here. It was what we call the gun show. So they would come into the gym. And we would literally do nothing but biceps and triceps. They'd get to get a pump. And then the deal was though you come in and literally would come in as we would pick three guys. Say, you and you. You pick your favorite bicep exercise. You pick your favorite one. You pick your favorite one. You three over there. You pick your favorite tricep. Try to surprise. And we just want a big circuit. Like, just like, how many reps? I don't care. How many set that don't care? Just like pump away. Like, I don't even care. We chose small muscle groups. Not really getting inferior with much. We're training them for the NFL combine, which is like, it's not a. It's a, it's a legs perform as basically. Right. So it's like, if they smash their biceps and triceps on a Saturday, it's not going to influence what we did on on Monday. So recovery wasn't an issue. Once we finished the gun show though. Now you have to go do your regents stuff. So if you need to car all work, you need physical therapy. Whatever you're going to do. So we would get them in the building with the low hanging fruit. And then we would actually get them to do their work. You can do the same thing. And I honestly do the same thing. I tend to do either. If I'm going to do an upper lower split, I'm going to do that stuff either Friday night or Saturday. Because it's very difficult for me to do a hard long workout Friday night. Right. Or even Friday morning for that matter. The same thing Saturday, like wake up. And it's not what it's like. It's family mode as kid things. I want to do stuff. I want. Man, but I can usually convince myself to be like, I just go in there and go 20 minutes and get your upper body stuff done. All right. I can walk myself into that mentally. It's harder to walk yourself into your five sets of five deadlift. It's sort of just like, I ain't got that to me right now. My high intensity intervals, the max of. I don't have that right now. So all either go for my long steady state stuff, which is like, I'm going to, I'm going on the bike. I'm riding down to the beach or coming back. And as a lonely, I can get myself to go for a bike ride like that. Oh, whatever. So I picked the thing that I, I'm likely to do on the days where I'm probably going to be my weakest quote unquote, not physically, but motivation lies. For a long time, I tried to like, it just got stuck in the way where my heart is done for Friday nights. And I'm just like, why am I doing this? I was having like a 50% success rate. Just like we are having like a no percent success rate with the NFL guys on Saturday. So you have to be a little bit tough. You have to grind sometimes. You know, get some motivation go after it. But you also have to be like, well, this is just stupid planning. Right? Like why put yourself in a position where you're just failing over and over and over when I could move it and go, look, those sessions are going to be things that are easier. They don't require as much gusto to get up and get them done. I get those things done 90% of the time. Because the worst case that I can be like, all right, we're going to go do a family thing. Give me 20 minutes. I'm going to smash the upper body and you don't need 20 minutes warm up. It's like I can just kind of jump into those things if I had to. If I feel great, then I can still go to something else. So I can do more. I can do longer session. But you're sort of immune to any situation. So I would book in those. I guess is what I'm saying. What's the day you're going to have the best day? And what's the day you generally have the worst? And put the programs around those situations. I love the idea of identifying the friction points, the high friction and low friction days. Friction meaning anything that impedes you from training consistently or well. And there are so many factors that ratchet into that sleep. Other social engagements work. You know, Friday night. I also find it tough to do any kind of training. I do cardiovascular training. I do interval type training on Fridays typically. But there's a lot of cumulative fatigue and stress that happens across the week. And usually for a long time, I gosh, we're then a decade down. I've been telling myself that Saturday is the day that I tried to reduce my cortisol. It's much as possible for the week. There you go. And then Sunday is the day that I enjoy that low cortisol state. And that's actually what opened up into the long slow run. I like she liked to think of myself as a bit of a mule during those long runs. I actually have a shirt that has a sloth on it. And that I wear to remind myself to go slowly on those runs. Not that I ever run that fast. But this is the whole mindset around it is to be a bit of a mule just kind of moving through it. And the fatigue factor is more one of, you know, at first is a little bit of boredom. But then I've noticed there's a whole different set of mental escapes that open up under different training types. And this is maybe something we get into a little bit in a few trapezoidal discussion. And when you train really intensely for short periods of time, one way your mind goes into a particular state. When you do long duration training, you're thinking and indeed even the way it affects sleep patterns is also very different. I think one of the great futures for neuroscience and exercise science in collaboration is to identify how different patterns of physical movement relate to different patterns of thinking and vice versa. Anyway, that's something maybe to just earmark for a future conversation. But there's clearly a relationship there. Yeah, well, when we certainly know of a pretty clear relationship between even what will classify a zone five exercise and deep sleep. So zone five again being you're breathing a lot through your mouth because you have to in order to bring in enough oxygen to offset the acidity created by the car. Exactly. Yeah, this is the high heart rate. So I mean, if you're going to look at it and hit a number, looking for something like 30 plus minutes a week. Being in the top 10% of your heart rate that impacts deep sleep is going to positively impact deep sleep as long as it's done very far away from deep sleep. So you don't want to do that at night. So you went in terms of time. So if you hit those numbers earlier in the day, oftentimes that will enhance sleep. Yeah, I was looking at some papers recently and the number that that kind of emerged from those papers was that unless it's low intensity exercise trying to exercise. About six hours or more away from your sleep time would be ideal now that said for those of you that after hit the gym or go for a run in the evening and then are trying to fall asleep for to six hours later. I wouldn't want that statement to impede your regular regular exercise. Yeah, this is there's an easy trick that just finish it with down regulation breathing. So it that's sort of one of our things that if you because that is a realistic situation right finish work at five or even six and then by time you're You're training or running or whatever you want to call it it's a 738 your home at nine you're eating and then you can't eat two hours before bed pretty soon. You run into a number of different collision points. Yep, make you wonder whether or not you're doing everything wrong or if it's really worth training at all. I would argue it's better to train the doctor train. Yeah, provided that you can still get to sleep. 100%. So you have to walk a little bit of a game. We run this issue at the NBA players. Right. You're playing games at six o'clock in night at start. Major League Baseball is a 705, 710 pitch right and also by the way we're changing time zones every five days. Right. You have see fighters and such were usually training twice a day. There is no option training or I mean we are training twice a day always. So we have to come up with strategies for that and there's other like non-out the scenarios of course where there's like there is no other option. Cool. So what we do is a couple of things number one that. Further away you can make it from sleep the better if possible. We do need to train though around the same time you're going to be playing. Like that has to happen. So the harder and longer we go in the training session the harder and longer we go in our down regulation post exercise. And that is in my estimation the number one lever you can pull that can help. Right. Now if it really does start crushing sleep. You're going to have to make a critical decision there. In general it's not a good reason to not exercise. But maybe you restricted to only a couple of days a week you go all the way up in intensity. And the rest of the days maybe 70% you stay in just kind of a working zone. Awesome. Maybe it's a longer down regulation. Maybe there's other strategies you can do. But yeah you want to be careful of and we've had this situation a number of times where it's sort of just like sleep complaints. We've had a lot of complaints sleep complaints. We run full sleep studies on them in their house. We do the whole thing with absolute rest. We come in. We do the whole thing. I tracking biomarkers the whole thing. And it's like, oh, you just need to stop doing intervals at 8 p.m. Right. And I would add to that another incentive for being able to train with or without caffeine is that it's very clear that even if you can fall asleep after caffeine with the preceding hours that caffeine consumed in the gosh even 12, but really 8 to 10 hours for hours prior to bedtime really disrupts the architecture of sleep. So if you critically rely on caffeine in order to train whatever your training might be. And you know that sleep is important for recovery. Well, then it's pretty obvious where I'm going with this. Yeah. So having that flexibility is vitally important. Yeah, you've probably also covered this, but you can actually measure that directly. So by eye tracking patterns, you can actually identify the effects that caffeine has on sleep independent of asleep time or not. Right. There are never positive effects correct. That said, I am of proponent of caffeine early in the day. And caffeine does have a lot of. Lots. Anti neurodegenerative and as long as you're not getting anxiety, it's a pro performance, both mental and physical performance. Of course, if you do not need caffeine, if you're one of these mutants that do not need caffeine in order to go about your daily living. With focus and intensity, then by all means don't start taking caffeine. I'm not the heat just fan. I am scientifically 100% of more personally. It does I don't do well on it. Well, you seem to ride a little bit more what we will call, you know, sympathetic tone, you know, kind of shifted towards more alert. I tend to be naturally a bit more like my bulldog costella was a little bit more on the mellow sleepy side. And caffeine just puts me right at that alert calm place. And I can get away with drinking it. I wouldn't say ridiculous, but fair amount of caffeine and remain there. But I do restrict it until the time right up about 2 p.m. at the latest as we when I try to drink caffeine. Number seven. Great. So number seven and eight are pretty simple. This is now choose the intensity and the volume. So we've discussed those at length in the previous episodes. We probably don't have the time to go back over all those details. So remember the adaptation you're training for and pick the appropriate rep range. Total amount of sets as well as the intensity to then get the corresponding adaptation. Right. All you have to do is select those things in terms of progression through a week. The rule of thumb we say for intensity is something around 3% per week. Right. For volume, it will depend on what you're doing a little bit, but any time you cross more than 10% per week. You're going to start running into problems. So I like 5% better. It doesn't need to be as low as 3. You can jump up much more than that. 5% to 7% is better. So if you are doing say running because because the numbers make it easy. And you're doing 10 miles per week total. And if you were to go up to 11 miles the next week, you're right around 10%. But what you wouldn't want to do is say I'm running 10 miles this week. And I did maybe 4 Monday 3 Wednesday 3 Friday. So 4 3 and 3 got your 10. Then you wouldn't want to add a mile every day. So Monday is said to doing 4. I did 5. Wednesday is said to doing 3. I did 4. Friday is said to doing 3. I did 4. You would react to you. And if you did, you went from 10 to 13, which is a much higher percent jump than the 10% prescribed. So the same thing would be true for lifting weights. The same thing is actually true for calories and trying to add them, etc. So the body tends to not handle those things as well, jumping more than 10% per week. So keeping with this idea of increasing progressive overload, being 10% more over some period of time. Am I correct in assuming that I want to identify one maybe two meaningful variables and progressing that for those variables? So progressive overload can come in the form of any of the modifiable variables. So you could increase the complexity of the movement. You could increase the intensity or the load. You could increase the volume by either more sets, more reps, or more total exercises in a day. What about time under tension? You could also manipulate how the tempo of each repetition. You could also manipulate how many times per day you train. So you can manipulate frequency. You can also manipulate rest intervals. So you can progressive overload any of these things. Increase intensity. Run a little bit faster. Complete the same amount of work. Slightly faster. Put 5% more on the barbell or the load or the handle or whatever you're going to do. That's a simple way. If you want to think about volume in the case of endurance work is simple, mileage, time, whatever. And the case of lifting all you have to do is take the amount of repetitions you're doing per set, multiply it by the sets. Add that all up. So if you're doing three sets of 10, that's 30 repetitions. If you did three exercises, you just did 90 repetitions. Put that number down for Monday. Put that number down for Wednesday. Put that number down for Friday. Add that total up. So say you did 90, 90, 90. You would look and say, my total number of repetitions this week is 270. If I want to go up 5%, then I need to go up another 15 or so total repetitions. Great. That's all we have to do. That's the increase. You may keep the load exactly the same. Keep the exercises the same chain. Nothing else but you want to add 15 more total reps for your week. And you may choose to do that by adding one more repetition per set. Close enough. So last week, I did three sets of 10. This week, I'm going to three sets of 11. It can be as simple as that. Again, it can be complex. I walked you through it can be any of the modifiable variables. But the progression I just laid out is fairly simple. And it's honestly the one I recommend for most people just because it will avoid confusion. And it will avoid people taking massive leaps and volume. So the typical strategy I would recommend here is increasing. Is increasing load or intensity or a little bit of a combination. Slowly for about six or so weeks. And then taking what we generally call a D load. So back down to maybe 70% whatever that number is you've been doing. So you did three sets of 10 and you worked yourself all the way up to three sets of 15. Back that down and maybe we'll do two sets of eight for the week. And then we'll come back the following week and go back and do the highest we've done now. All of a sudden we're going to do four sets of 12 or something like that. So if you get these little D loads every depending on what you're doing for the eight weeks or so. You should be in a spot where you can continually progress for a very long time without either burning out or overloading and overstressing and injury pattern. So the simple way. Pick intensity or volume and just go up slightly every week for a short span of time generally around six weeks. And then you come back and change your strategy if you like. Because you mentioned sets and repetitions here. So I wanted to remind folks that in the episode that we did on strength and hypertrophy. And that also included speed. There was a description of a terrific program for strength, which is the three by five program or three two five program as it's called, as to select three to five exercises performed for three to five repetitions three to five times per week with three to five minutes rest in between those exercises for three to five sets. And if I recall correctly, the protocol for generating hypertrophy muscle growth is to perform a minimum of ten and probably more like 15 to 20 sets per muscle group per week. And that can be done in a single session per muscle per week. So one could train for instance quarter steps one day per week as long as you're getting that volume of sets per week. Or it could be divided up across two or three different sessions for that individual muscle group. Of course, people are going to target all their major muscle groups and hopefully some of them minor muscle groups as well. And as I recall, the number of repetitions that can generate hypertrophy is quite broad anywhere from six repetitions all the way up to 30 repetitions, but by the end of the set. It should be two failure or close to failure with good for is that correct. Yeah, and we would say close to failure is probably most appropriate. Actually, read failure may be on a few of the sets, maybe the end and probably best to choose that with the exercises that are safer. Not that any exercises, particularly unsafe if you do it appropriately, but you may not want to go to true failure on every set for the more complex larger riskier exercises. So head pretty close to failure, but not all the way. And I realize I forgot to mention rest intervals between sets. It follows that if a large range of repetitions are performed that a large range of rest intervals are allowed, meaning there could be rest intervals between sets of as low as 30 seconds between sets or as high of two or three minutes depending on the loads that one is using. And that of course will scale with the number of repetitions. Excellent. In fact, that sort of leads me into step number nine of designing your own training program, which is you've decided our goal. We've worked our calendar out. We've figured out how many days per week and how long we're going to work out in those sessions. We then went and selected our exercises. We balance them across the movement patterns and the muscle groups that we need. So we're not causing excessive stress on the same exact joint or muscle group over time. We then ordered our exercises based on priority. All right, because of that, we have identified our goal. We went back and we selected the volume, which is the repetitions per set, the total amount of sets and the load per set that matched the goal that we wanted to get or the adaptation. Now all we have to do is fill in the rest intervals, which reflect back again the goal. So generally higher rest intervals, which means time that you rest between your sets, higher, somewhere between two to five minutes, four things like speed, power and strength. Perhaps a little bit lower, although as you mentioned, it could also stay high for hypertrophy. And then for endurance, you follow the rest interval that reflects the type of endurance training that you'd like to get. That's walked us through one through nine. We're almost done. We've put together a pretty nice little protocol. It should be well rounded. It should be effective. We've also talked about how to progress it from week to week. Keeping it within again four to six weeks, maybe up to eight before we then take a back off. The very last thing we have to do to make sure this training program is customized to you, your goal and your situation, which is then going to enhance your likelihood of adherence and consistency, as well as increase the likelihood of effectiveness. As we just have to do a little bit of what we call chaos manager, which is take a quick moment to think through this program looks great. But if I had to nitpick it, where are the possible chances of failure? And you just want to sort of think about where or where would I predict things would go wrong. And if you anything pops out to you, try to come up with your solution at the beginning. And this could be a number of things. So maybe you've picked an exercise and you realize man, I really actually don't like that exercise. Or maybe you look at the schedule now that it's laid out in front of you. You look at your works schedule and you're like, maybe that's a bit of grass. I don't know, could be any of the number of things. But it is a useful exercise to just think through everything realistically. I typically just like it's the advantage I teach my graduate students before we hit submit. We're going to sleep. So it's there. It's ready. We're going to take 12 hours. We're going to wake up the next day. Look at it again and go, are we sure we're good here? Yeah. Make adjustments if you need it. If not, if you feel confident, then hit send and cross your fingers. Yeah, we were referring to submitting the manuscript. It's interesting. You say that I have a statement that I always make to people my lab. They hit submit. And now I say that you realize you're going to wake up tomorrow morning. There's going to be an email in your inbox that something was formatted incorrectly. And you're going to spend tomorrow reformatting and submitting again. So I have also learned that every project is actually too project. I'm trying to not dial reading. Yeah, it's true. You've done this enough times. You've done this many dozens of times. And then there's also another trueism of science, which is that you know, there's the project. There's a scientific question. And then the paper is yet another project. And I actually think this is an analogy that carries over to other domains of life. I think that any time we take on something if we want to write a book or we want to get a degree or we want to get an fitness program. I think it's worth thinking about those decisions as actually too. Taking on two major things because one is the planning and organization around that thing and the other is the actual performance of the thing. And so I say that because here what you just described this, you know, ten steps to consider and designing a program. I think some people who are real list makers and love the precision and the thoroughness. And I'm one of these people thinking this is great. I just want to do check off each one of these things on the list and figure out the ideal program for me or given period of time, etc. And then other folks might be thinking, well, that's a lot. That's just a lot to do. But what I know with certainty is that performing those sorts of, let's just call them what they are. Those tasks of figuring out what's what, where the defenders are, etc. Without question makes everything go so much more smoothly once you are into the actual performance, the action of doing the action. The exercise program or the book or the podcast or whatever it is that you happen to do. So I'm grateful that you brought up both the things that act as conduits for getting good work done and this notion of defenders and bottlenecks. Because if we don't consider those, I would argue that it's a very low probability that anyone will succeed. But when one does consider those, even just a few of them, I think the probability of success goes way way up immediately. That's actually a very good point. That is a lot of work for a lot of people. And I know when I'm consuming information, it is helpful to hear structure and systems and design. It's also helpful to hear actual real life examples. So maybe the next thing we can do here is I can just walk you through and entire setup and a program, considering folks that are in Bucket A, B and C. And maybe I'll save a little bit of the explanation and we'll eliminate maybe some background. I'll just walk you through what this could look like. All right. So I created a program which should run about a year. And the idea here is that this could be an evergreen system. So one could check off all the boxes that we've talked about. So in general, we want to have three primary goals with exercise. We want to look a certain way, whatever that means to you. We want to be able to perform a certain way, whether that's for life goals, like hiking and energy or sport goals or whatever. And then we want to be able to do that across our lifespan. Okay. So a program that gives you all the goals we talked about. And a program that covers that health combine that we referred to way back in some of our earlier discussions, which as a little bit of recap is. What are the physical fitness parameters that we know are critical to maintaining both lifespan and wellness span? And as a bit of a reminder, those are things like your grip strength, your leg strength, your total amount of muscle mass, your actual speed and power so that you can catch yourself from a fall, your VO2 max, and your physical fitness. So I want to program it as a little bit of all that. As similar actually, and we're kind of crossing barriers between our three buckets. So I need to be able to control my fat. I need to be able to have enough muscle. That muscle needs to have enough function. And I need to be able to maintain range of motion so that I don't lose flexibility and get hurt. And then I need to have a good VO2 max as well as to be able to sustain energy over time. So that was the goal of my progress. Now a couple of other things that we haven't chatted about, which are very important. You have mentioned, I think on a previous podcast about the importance of seeing light. Is this something you've covered at one point? I joke that I'll be going into the grave and they'll be shoveling their onto me and I'll be telling people what I'll tell you again now, which is to get five to 30 minutes of sunlight viewing as early in the day as possible. Ideally from sunlight. That's why it's called sunlight. We're from bright lights of another kind if you cannot get sunlight. And also get that in the evening and then avoid bright lights between the hours of 10 pm and 4 pm. Unless you do shift to work in which case check out our episode on shift work. Amazing. So we've got a little bit of a juxtaposition where people are like, I need to work out and do all this training, but then I'm also supposed to be outside. Okay, how do I blend those two things into my training program? Cool. So I check that box as well. And that's what I'm talking about. The last thing here is we've talked about structured exercise and just in this episode we've really opened up and do non-structured exercise, hiking, sports, things like that. Well, one thing that is incredibly clear and my colleague and friend Tommy Wood at the University of Washington published a fantastic paper very recently. On the importance of proprioception in maintaining and staving off late onset dementia and aparthensis. Maybe just remind people what proprioception is. Which is yeah, absolutely. So there's structured exercise and that's very important. But then there's also things like balance and coordination and proprioception meaning you're adjusting to stimuli coming in from the outside world. So this stimuli could be sound, could be light, could be smell, or in the physical case the body it is where you are at in space. So I'm feeling like I'm falling to the left, therefore I need to correct and move back to the right. So you don't get this with doing things like a hacksquat on a machine. You get this typically from being outside. So now you're smelling and seeing things and you're also not landing with your foot and the exact same position on an even platform. We get this from things like sport. Now I'm not only exercising but I'm reacting to the outside world. The ball is going over here. My opponent's going over there. So it's very important in my opinion to have at least one session per week of exercise. In which you are doing something that challenges proprioception. Right. So how do I fold all of these best practices into one training program? That's not 200 hours a week, seven days a week. That's what I've laid out to you. Makes sense? Cool. Let me walk you through it and then maybe we'll come back into each individual category and you can ask questions about them. So the way that I think is best is to have a goal and have that goal be around eight to ten weeks long like we've been talking about. So what I gave you is let's start off with quarter number one of the year. So perhaps January through March or so and it doesn't have to be this one but just as an example. You decide your goal is going to be to put some muscle mass on. So we're going to prioritize adding muscle. Okay. Now within that you're going to be bulking up adding some muscle but we're also going to be sleeping more. We know we need extra recovery in this session and we need to go up in calories. Now this happens to work nice for a couple of reasons. But in that protocol maybe we're going to do seven days or seven sessions a week of physical activity doesn't mean seven days. But maybe those sessions are something like. I will do one indoor sport. This could be basketball. Could be any number of things right. So I got my sport kicked off and it's indoors. Why? I'm I'm January to March. The weather is probably not great for most of the world. So I'm not going to do as much outside activity. I'm going to do weights maybe three or four times a week and then maybe two days a week I'll go for a long walk. Okay. Again, we'll come back and I'll explain you why I made all these individual choices. So you're going to run that for the first quarter at the end of this quarter you're going to take a D load week. So this could be fully off. Maybe this is when you schedule a vacation. Maybe this is backing off. Maybe you just keep your walks in and you spend the extra time on your family or work or whatever else we do. So we've both up a little bit. We spent 12 weeks adding some mass. Now we're going to transition into quarter two, which is where we start to actually get lean. This is actually a pretty standard bodybuilding template, which is you put on some mass first and then you get lean after that. So now we're going to get lean from April to June. We're going to bring calories down a little bit. So now we're actually going to play in a high book, Lordx State somewhat. The days tend to get longer. So we're going to have more time to spend in the sun. So we're going to shift a little bit from an indoor sport activity like the example I said earlier was basketball. To maybe stand up, paddle boarding. Or some other thing where you're actually getting your sport done, you're reacting, using pro perception. But now you're getting that sun and there as well because you have a greater opportunity to actually do so. And the weather probably is going to cooperate with you more often than it would in say February. You then maybe going to pick a fitness or an exercise class. You know, any number of routines where you're with multiple people. And then two days a week in addition to that, you're going to maybe lift some weights. All right. So now we've had some muscle. Now we've got lean. And all the sudden we're actually looking pretty good for the summertime. Hmm interesting, right. Quarter three, July to September, we'll transition and we'll try to get into a great cardiovascular shape. So we'll transition more into some high intensity interval type of stuff more frequently. We're going to maybe stay at maintenance calories now. We spent a little bit of time hyper. We went hypoman now we're going to go back to maintenance and keep it long. We're going to continue to choose some outdoor sports, but maybe you change it up. Maybe you keep the same one. Maybe maybe now we switch it out in the golf or now we pick a pickle ball or we play basketball, but now we just do it outside. Any number of things you can do, right. So maybe even we do a couple change it up. You do that twice a week. You're spending more time in the sun now. You're looking outside and you're seeing this great weather and you're not cooped up in a gym. But you're getting your physical fitness in. That's also going to be eating in your high intensity or your interval, your conditioning, because you're doing more stuff like that rather than lifting energy. And then maybe you're actually going to do some track workouts. Maybe we'll do this on a bike or we'll do some hells friends outside. Any number of things. And then we'll do that maybe twice a week. And then we'll still lift weights twice a week in our gym. The last quarter then is going to be October to December and we're going to transition there and do more pure cardiovascular fitness. Okay, because we're doing that, we're going to be working harder and remember cardiovascular training is generally Expelling much more calories than lifting. So we're going to actually go up in calories. We're going to return to that and that works out kind of well because I don't know if you know or not, but people tend to eat a little more calories from the months of say November through December. Yeah holidays and at least in Northern Hemisphere colder temperatures. So maybe even we play with two workouts a day here. We're trying to get really in shape. We're trying to improve our conditioning and our endurance and multiple areas. We're going to actually transition back into an indoor sport. So maybe we're going to do some kit boxing or a Gigi Tsuklas or something like that. We're going to maybe hit the cardio machine once or twice. Now we're hopping on a stair master versus climber, more maybe getting an assault bike goings and then like that. Maybe hit some machines and do our lifting there. Maybe we had spent the rest the early part of the year on barbells and dumbbells with transition to some machines. And then we'll still try to get outside and walk twice a week. Okay, and week that gets us our outside activity, but it's not necessarily a structured program. So we've got a 15 minutes where the weather is breaking a little bit. So let's walk get outside and get a walk. All right. So that's the overall structure of everything. I would like to actually go back to the beginning now and kind of walk through each one of these things in detail and explain why I chose certain things. I've kind of given some hints already, but I think it'd be helpful to walk back to the beginning and start there. Great. I love the overall structure. I have just a couple of questions. The idea of training mostly for high-perchrophy, January through March, makes sense followed by period from April through June focusing primarily on fat loss. And then from July to September, speed and interval type work. And then October to December, you put to emphasize endurance type training. I thought for a moment that when we got to October to December, you were going to emphasize strength. And I'm wondering whether or not there's any incentive for training for strength October to December so that when one arrives at the high-perchrophy training, January through March, or that much stronger. The idea of being then there's more muscle to hold on to as one tries to lose fat from April through June. And then July through September is the speedwork or is July through September the speed slash power phase of the program. The July through September would be more like your higher heart rate learning to get all the way up, maximum exertion and then recovering. And October to December is long form endurance. Moderate to long form, right? So it's closer to that. A robot capacity stuff. It is closer to longer duration and moving through that spectrum. You are a stout and pointing out that I didn't have pure strength really in there. You certainly could fold it in. But quite literally, if you spent three months bulking up in January to March, that's going to bring some strength along the way. So you should be fine there. But you absolutely could alter any of these variables. If you wanted to emphasize something more than that, so say you actually felt like you ran into the fitness testing and you identified actually your endurance is pretty good. But you're struggling maybe with a little bit of strength and maybe a little bit of lower muscle mass. You could substitute quarter three or quarter four and say one of those quarters would be strength. And then I'll do all of my conditioning in another quarter. And what you've really done is the programming is still fairly simple. You've just altered the priorities a little bit and therefore you've altered the adaptation across the year and why this is really important. This template is meant to be something you can just run back year after year after year and you make a subtle change like that. And now over the course of five, ten, twenty years, you're going to be in a fantastic spot at the end. So you can make easy adjustments along the way as priorities pop up as goals pop up. But you're going to be in a position where everything is that there's nothing that's going to be lagging behind you'll be in a good spot. Most of your bases are covered to be pretty lean. Have a good amount of muscle and to be in great shape. Two other questions one just a quick question for sake of generating purpose up to feedback during the endurance phase is trail running. Good. Absolutely great thinking back to the days running cross country. It's October December your trail running totally training for endurance. The ground is not super solid which is even better in this case, right? So you're making more choices and trying to not fall on your face. Absolutely. And then you mentioned bulking up and I just wanted to highlight that there are some folks myself included. While I'd like to add a little bit of muscle here and there, I'm not interested in over eating to the point where I lay down a lot of body fat. A lot of body fat stores along with that and I think a lot of people out there are not necessarily interested in going to go bulking up. I also have my understanding of the literature and tell me if I'm wrong. Is that well, there does need to be some sort of coloric surplus above what is required to maintain body weight in order to build muscle that many people who try and quote unquote bulk up. Basically just end up expanding the size of their cheeks and face along with their limbs and torso. Yeah. You know, I'm not trying to poke fun at them, but the idea of deliberately over eating is to the point where a lot of body fat stores come along. I would imagine that would just make the April through June phase that much harder. And I'm not sure it's ever been studied directly, but I can't imagine it's all that, excuse me, all that healthy to bring along a lot of out of post issue in one's pursuit of high-peritrophy. You're absolutely correct. We have not gotten into the nutritional details there, but yeah, thank you. Good clarification, boy. A couple of things. You're not going to be doing this very long. It's 12 weeks. Right. We're not going to be six or eight. You're going to be eight. Number two, just since we're here to clarify, the literature is ongoing in this area. And there's actually a handful of studies that I know are coming soon. But in general, when I say hyper-chloric here, I'm referring to an increasing Chloric intake above baseline by something like 10 to 15%. So if you normally eat 25 hundred calories throughout the day, you might add another 250 to 400. I'm not doubling calories. I don't want you to be stuffing your face, hating food, filling off all day. And then putting on half of your weight is fat and half of your weight is muscle. It is just technically hyper-chloric because you're eating more, which is an absolute requirement for most people to add muscle. Some folks who have a high percentage of body fat and a low level of fitness training can actually get away with just being either isochloric technically or even a little bit lower and still adding some muscle while losing some fat. But for most folks, that's going to be challenging. So you're going to want to be in a hyper-chloric state. Another reason I put it in here is because remember, people tend to make these extra calorie choices during this part of the year anyways. And so you're sort of playing in the life as why I chose that, right? It's like, hey, you can't restrict calories all the time. It's really, really hard. So maybe if we can put it calorie restriction during the phases of the year, that's a little bit easier. And give you the freedom to have a little bit more calories during the phase of the year when you're probably going to want to do that anyways. Just make sure you're doing a style of training. That supports that. So you're going to be trying to add muscle when you know you're going to be adding more calories. We're going to be trying to really push the pace on our conditioning when we know we're going to be eating more calories anyways. And so that is actually in fact exactly why it shows those goals for those times of the year. It's because we're now playing into life a little bit more. But we again certainly do not want to be eating to an excess where it's causing some of the problems you might. We just need to be eating a little bit more. The last point here is the next phase, April the June, we know we're going hyper-chloric. So it's always kind of nice to go, yeah, we're going to go in a little bit of a calorie deficit here. But it's really just these few months and it's okay because I spent the last six months where I wasn't restricting that much. And then one actually where I got to eat a little bit more. And now cool, not hard for me to convince somebody to go. We're going to bring the calories down right now. Around a month and two months and it's just going to be this 12 or 16 week phase or whatever you're not being in there. So those were some of the rational that I was thinking of what I decided to do that. But thank you. That's a very important point in terms of hyper-chloric. It's not the dirty book. It's not the excess that a lot of folks will do. And just a final point for folks in the Southern Hemisphere Australia and South Americans. We actually have a large-learned relationship in the Southern Hemisphere. Of course, adjust accordingly even though the holiday months are still in November, December. There are of course holidays all year long before. So many of the major holidays are around November, December, but it's summer down there. Just adjusting accordingly. There's nothing wholly about trying to achieve certain adaptations at certain times of year. It's more about trying to eliminate bottlenecks defenders, as you mentioned. And it's really about the sequence. So if we go back to that first quarter, we're going to try to add some mass for the reasons I just described. It's also tends to be pretty motivating. You're going to start the year off. You're going to want to train and get it excited because of your new year's resolution. And you're going to see results immediately. We've talked about this in some of the previous episodes. The nice part about hyper-chloric training is you see your muscle scrolling right now. Where the endurance of tends to have a little bit more of a delayed gratification. So I'm going to give you a win early. Okay. Now, we're also going to be sleeping more. Because we know and maybe we'll get into this in a future episode that sleep is absolutely critical to recovery. And critical to growing muscle mass. So you're going to emphasize sleep more during this part of the year. Also because the sun is very low. It's harder to sleep for a lot of folks longer when the sun is out for longer, especially if you don't have a perfect blackout career. And so you're just like trying to play with the restrictions life gives you and optimize your scenario. So the sun is probably not out very often, and especially depending on where you live. If you're anywhere where I grew up in the Pacific Northwest. It's going to be dark and gray and gloomy most of the day. So it's not hard to convince you to go sleep a little bit more often. So we'll do that. That's also again why I chose an indoor sport, that activity. You're going to not shoot yourself in the foot. Being in the gym when it's cold and crappy outside is not that hard to convince yourself to do. So you're going to be lifting your weights, say four times a week. And then again, getting some outside time in the form of a walk. So that you can do it in the middle of work if you have to or catching 20 minutes here there. Whatever it needs to be. The chances of you missing that walk are little and you'll still get some outside time. You can you've talked about the importance of getting sunlight in even if it is overcast. So you can still nail all those boxes and be in a pretty good spot at the end of that quarter. Okay, so moving on to quarter two then April to June. A lot of people want to look good during the summer months. You're more likely to be outside. You're more likely to have your shirt off because it's hot because you're in your own vacation or going to the beach. So let's play into that a little bit. Let's let people look a little bit better. If that's what they determine to be looking better. During the months when they're more likely to have that. You're also more likely to have things like weddings. Over the summertime people don't get married often in the winter and so people want to look good for these events. So let's play into what a lot of people already want and let's help you get leaner. Not a lot of holidays that involve eating. During that phase and so you're not going to feel like you're missing out on a ton of life outside of maybe a few smaller holidays in that phase. The days are getting longer and so we're going to choose to get in the sun more often. We can start getting a tan better. We can start getting ready for summer. And so that's why we exchanged our indoor sport for an outdoor sport surfing, hiking, cycling outside. Whatever the thing is you want to do. There's tons of them kiteboarding like said skateboarding. There you go. You know, start skating a little bit. Whatever it needs to be. So we'll do that once a week or so. And then I actually threw in a fit in class here. And there's a couple of reasons. One, now it's sort of nice to take the pressure programming off. It's also nice to if you've been lifting by yourself to get in there and lift a somebody else. It's also nice to now have some social interaction. The gamification, the group, the scoring stuff that happens in fitness classes is very, very powerful. It tends to be somewhat fleeting. So it won't last for a long time for some. And so if you're going to do that, you're going to join this activity class. Even if it's not great in the program design isn't perfect. It's fine for 10 weeks. In fact, you may really really enjoy it. And also, again, gives you just, it gives you something new to think about. Music, because on your out of your house, if you're lifting your house, you're going to different part of the gym. The schedule is a little tighter. So you can't just go work out whenever you want. You got to sort of show up when the class is going and you're probably fine. You just love it. You also get some social interaction, right? Which is something that's also very important that we haven't really discussed yet. If you're out playing basketball by yourself or whatnot. So this is just another thing I'm trying to fold in that still allows you to check off multiple boxes of things that are healthy for you. You've had episodes on the importance of social connection interaction. We talked about that in the quad break down of making sure you have relationship time and things like that. So throwing it into fitness class and just doing honestly something quite different is pretty fun. But then still keeping two days a week where you're doing a traditional strength training thing, so you have some quality control there. Lastly, you can also then make sure you're hitting any specific movements or muscle groups that are very important to. So you don't get to control that in your fitness class. But now you can at least do the gym and make sure you hit that muscle group that you have an interest in it. So now we're feeling pretty good. We're rolling into the summer. We're pretty lean. We're getting out in the sun a lot. We're bringing calories down a little bit and we probably are feeling pretty happy. We're also not burnt out. We've done a lot of fun things and we've checked a lot of the boxes off for long-term development. We had a combination of specificity with actually a selection. But we also folded in just a little bit of variation. So we don't have to worry about overuse injury of doing the same machines, the same lift, months and months and months after months and slowly wearing down something. If our technique isn't perfect. Okay. So now we're going to go into our quarter three, which is the summer months, basically, up here at least, delighted September. Well, transition. It's been a while since we've done some conditioning. All right. So we may have lost a little cardiovascular fitness. We may have, you know, not feeling great anymore. Maybe energy throughout the day. So I'm starting to wake down. So we're going to get in shape. We're going to push our heart rate high. And we're going to bring the calories back up the summertime, Fourth of July, other holidays like this where eating is involved. Maybe you're going to sporting events and things like that. Our sport choice is often going to be outdoors. But in fact, what you'll notice here is I've ramped the sport choice up to twice a week. And in fact, I would encourage you to do two different types of exercise. And one of the primary reasons for that is to spend more time outside. A challenge we often see with people with exercises going, man, it's so nice outside. I can't go sitting the gym for 45 minutes. All right. I don't have that much free time. And then here we're going to over here, challenge me. I need to get direct sunlight more and like, how am I going to fit this in? Well, do you exercise outside? Enjoy it. Now, if you live down here like us, you take sunshine for granted. But a lot of people I know it's like it's only nice for two and a half months of the year. Get outside. So let's push more of our fitness training to outdoor activities. These sports can be intense or not, right? It could be go out there and swim hard. Get in the ocean. You're going to do open ocean swimming instead of swimming in the pool indoors. Or whatever the case may be. We're going to give ourselves more of a priority of being outside. Looking, we've looked pretty good or a little tan and we're enjoying all the benefits of training outside. And the lack of structure. Still, we have structure but not so specific like the machines and the weight skills. Maybe even now we're doing some crack workouts. So now we can do something like sprint the straightaways, lock the corners. And we don't have to again do our conditioning on the same stair master or machine or wherever we're on. So we're going to enjoy some stuff like that. And we're going to be athletic. We're going to run. We're going to move. We haven't talked about that yet. Everything has really been about sort of structured exercise. Well now we're going to do some sprint work. We're going to get out and see that which is a really important human quality that I think is important to not live in. This is actually ability to sprint. So we'll do that. And then we'll still make sure we lift twice a week. For the same reasons I talked about in the previous phase. So we make sure we have some quality control there. We maintain some of the muscle that we built in the quarter before. We don't lose too much strength. There is very good literature to suggest strength maintenance. Can be done in as little as five sets per week for a very long time. Really up to eight plus weeks. If you do a little bit. So you're touching enough where you're not going to get really really really weak. But what you wouldn't want to do is go 12 or 16 weeks. Where you lifted no weights. And maybe you got in great shape. But you're going to feel very weak after that. So maybe that number coming out to one time a week. If you really wanted it to. But one to two days a week where you're lifting the big exercises. The muscle groups and movements of interest. And you're good to go. Then lastly, we roll into our final quarter, which is October to December. And we're going to really get in great shape. The sun is starting to come down. We're rolling into the holidays. Whether it's getting worse. We may have other outdoor activities we want to do like. In my case, you're going on a hunting trip. We have some travel conferences. Whatever the case may be. And so we're going to choose an indoor sport. And I love combat sports. So the example I gave earlier was like a jitsu or maybe you just transition your basketball to inside or your pickleball comes inside or whatever it happens to be. And you're still going to have that twice a week. And then maybe instead of the track workout outside, you do that same workout indoors now back on some sort of machine. Or something like that. Our weights are actually now down to once a week. Because we're really pushing the pace on cardiovascular. We're doing it once a week to maintain it and not lose and get too far behind. But we're really want to bring up our VO2 wax. We want to bring up our efficiency. Our cardiac output and everything like that. And we're still going to now walk twice a week. So that we get something outside. And I talked about why again, it's nice to have that flexibility. If not having to train outside because now you got to warm up and do all those things. You just get out and get to walk in. You still get the outdoor experience. So we run the entire thing. And then you just start back the next year. Ideally, again, at the end of every quarter, you take a week off. Whether that is a true full week off, which I'm fully in support of. I mean friends, we're only talking about four off weeks a year. That's absolutely fine. Or it could even be a slight. D load week if you wanted to be. So we shouldn't run into too many issues of overuse. We have a lot of variety. We get a lot of movement patterns in because we're mixing in support with machines and dumbbells. We're mixing in social interaction. We're mixing in the sun. We're mixing in enjoyment. We're mixing in fat loss strength. I purchased for you some cardiovascular and so mixing in calories in. Hi, we're mixing in a little bit of calories low. And we're trying to hit as many of these knows as possible. If you also wanted to cut each one of these a little bit short and repeat your fitness testing at the end of every quarter you could. I would probably recommend doing it at least once a year. Perhaps doing it maybe the third week of December or so. So you run that testing. That's your last week of training. Then you get to go on your vacation break. You come back the beginning of the year. You've got new goals, new targets, and you go. If you want to repeat it twice a year, do the same sort of thing at the end of June. It's fine. I know I laid these out as quarters, which is generally to a week with one back off week. But if you wanted to make it nine weeks in a testing week and then a back off or ten weeks. It's fine. It's close enough. So the last little thing I want to say is. Let's assume you're doing it 12 weeks. And you're going to have a back off week at the end of the 12 weeks. I would actually still then recommend having at least one back off week. Half way through. So it would look like this five weeks hard, where you're progressing. You're going up up up up up up every week or either increasing volume intensity like we talked about. You're going to have to go. Then week six. Delode. Go down to 70% volume intensity. Come back. Go hard for five more weeks. And now week 12 is your true off week where you again. Take the whole thing off. If you do that, you now have four weeks a year where you're totally off. You have four weeks a year where you're really backing down. And you just have five week segments all year round where you're just going to push it hard for five weeks. You're going to break. You're going to reset and you're going to transition a little bit. Now as I started this conversation off with, there are many ways you could structure your training program throughout the year and hit those primary goals we talked about of looking fantastic, feeling amazing and being able to do that your entire life. All I can tell you though is I know this model works. Because we've done this a lot with our clients in our rapid health optimization program. And this spans everything from 25 year old folks who are competing in the Boston Marathon to a lot of individuals who have never exercised with for who maybe have done a little bit of exercise. In fact, it's quite literally all three of the buckets you laid out. We've had clients in all of those areas both men and women, young and old. And we've had a tremendous amount of success transforming their lives using a very similar model to what I just laid out. I find that overall structure to be immensely informative. And I'll tell you why in the context of a number of examples of myself, although that's the least important of them, frankly. But examples of family members of mine and friends of mine who undertaken consistent exercise training programs, but that haven't varied the program so much. And here again, I look at the person who really loves to swim. They have a low barrier of entry to the pool or to the ocean. They love being in the water. I am not one such person. I like being in the water, but I don't motivate to drive to the pool or to bike to the pool or to get into the ocean that often. Once I do it, I enjoy it. But for me, it's running and lifting weights and it has been for a very long time. I have a family member, close friend, and a member who doesn't really like, quote, unquote, exercise, but loves dance and dancing. Going out dancing, yes, but dance classes. Amazing. Really enjoys it. Loves to be distracted from the fact that she's doing exercise and just really enjoys it. And actually is a very good dancer despite the fact that she's related to me. And on and on. There are many examples, I think of folks that fall into the different bins that we talked about earlier, but that also tend to default towards a given structure of training one way and doing that throughout the year. I can tell you right now that I'm personally going to modify my schedule according to this four quarters per year. It actually works because I've mostly been on the quarter system in academics for a very long time. I was at a university had a semester system once, but this quarter system is actually the one that we follow academically. So that's one reason why it's a natural fit for me. I confess that I typically don't vary up the proportions of endurance to resistance training. I tend to keep those about three and three across the week three resistance training sessions three. Let's call them cardio sessions, but each one designed to achieve a different adaptation and I've now altered those even further based on your recommendations in this episode and previous episodes. But what I have not done is to really think about. Delode and to really stick to the structure that I set out to accomplish across the year on the topic of delode. For me, the delode has been when I get overwhelmed with work or I've gotten sick. I don't tend to get sick that often, but every once in a while get knocked back with a cold or a flu once every three or four years. I seem to really get hammered with a fever inducing something or other and then I'm bedring for a couple days and then I'm back at it. And I tend to come back rather slowly and that tends to be my week off. But I'm beginning to wonder whether or not part of the reason I hit those streaks of being overwhelmed by sickness or by stress. Is that I have not done a delode period. So one of the things that I'm going to immediately implement is a periodic delode according to the program that you described. And I'm also going to start matching my specific goals for each quarter with time of year. I don't think I've done that and it's not because I live in California. By the way, folks, there are temperature variations in amount of light across the day variations in California as well. Although they are not as dramatic as they would be under the norm. Pretty moderate. But of course, some of listeners are the equator, so they have the opposite of it. In any event, I'm definitely going to do that. I'm going to start incorporating regular delode periods. And I am going to be very dedicated, very disciplined about sticking to a program for three months devoted mainly to hypertrophy. Then a three month program devoted to fat loss. Then a program devoted to a robotic output. And then one devoted to endurance, although I must say it's very tempting for me to do a very specific strength dedicated portion. Sure, because I don't tend to be particularly strong. I'm not weak, but I'm not particularly strong. So I might consult with you as to how I could vary endurance and strength. In any event, I love the idea of a macro structure. And I love the idea of delodes in anticipation of being able to go further. The long run in terms of results. I'm hoping this next year, because we're just on the on the cusp of a new year, we'll be the first year in which I don't find myself getting some bugger virus or whatever happens to be from time to time and having to back off on training for that reason. And that prompts a question. And it's something that I want to get into in more detail with you when you describe recovery coming up a second. But a couple of quick questions, maybe there's some short or short-ish answers you could provide. If I'm not feeling well, like I really had a poor night sleep, maybe just two to four hours of sleep for whatever reason. Trainer don't train. That's the first question. Second question is, if I'm starting to feel a little bit of a throat tickle, and I'm in that phase of denial, like I don't get sick, I'm not getting sick. And I would I be better off bundling up some hot liquids, getting into bed, sleeping a little bit more, etc. And protecting myself against that, or would I be better off training? And if I've, and then the third question is, if I've already succumbed to a bug, but it's not a severe bug. I don't have elevated body temperature. So no fever. I'm not hacking up, not productive cough or anything like that. But I'm feeling just kind of not well, head coldish. I, you know, sort of thing comes to mind, and it's not seasonal allergies. Trainer don't train. Leaving aside the point of whether or not you know, you're in a position to, you know, getting one else sick. Because obviously that's a bad idea. Okay. So lack of sleep. I would say 30 to 40% of one's typical sleep, the previous night, trainer no train. I'm already in a field like one might be getting ill. And then the third category is coming back from from young sick. Okay. Thanks. And sorry for the extended question, but I want to make sure there was enough detail there because I think these are three common scenarios. We are going to cover that in the recovery conversation. That's next in detail. And I will give you very specific guidelines and we'll have a plenty of time to go into that. The quick answer is, it comes back to what phase of training you're in. Now, to walk through each scenario, if it is a crummy night of sleep, and I am in a phase of train in which we are trying to cause adaptation. I have a lot of space in my schedule, and I'm really using this time to make progress because I know coming up soon, my schedule will change and my time to train will go down. I'm still training. I might use a bunch of tricks that we have for feeling better instantaneously. We call these little hacks, these are acute hacks. These are not chronic hacks. I'm going to push the base. If it is really close to a D load week, say it's Wednesday and I start my D load next week. Or this is not one bad night of sleep. This has been four bad nights of sleep in the last five days. This has been six kind of crummy nights over the course of the last nine. And you're starting to see larger pattern, and that's a different answer. So the question we're going to ask ourselves, is this acute? Or is this a tendency or actually a chronic thing? If it's acute and we're close, we're going to train through it. If it's acute, and we, this is not a phase of training. We're trying to really push. Then maybe we back off a little bit. If it's the opposite though, we need to probably make some changes and give ourselves some recovery. This may include anything from a moderate training session. Maybe I'm going to go in the sauna and sit through that and then do some breathing drills and some mobility stuff. Oh, great. Maybe I'm going to go to the gym and ride the bike at 50% art rate. Something restorative like that gives you a little bit energy, but doesn't beat you down. That's probably what we're learning. If you're feeling sick and you think it's coming, I'm probably going to do option to as well, which is some sort of restorative training. This tends to be moderate. It could be weights. It could be any of the stuff. Maybe you're going to go out for your swim. But we're not going to push past probably about 70%. We can absolutely induce immunosuppression with excessive training. And so you may want to walk out of that. The last case, which was I think phase number three, you said there, which is sort of like I got a pretty gnarly cold right now. I'm going to train most of the time for most people. I'm just going to say just shut it down. Get out of there. If you're not going to be able to get productivity done there, you may be better off either going and sleeping. Catching up on work, doing other stuff so that the next time we go to train, you don't feel behind. And we can give a good solid effort for it. So I know other people who will train right through it. I tend to not to be totally frank. If I'm feeling kind of junk, I'm really not going to train. I may actually probably do some hot water immersion. So bath, jacuzzi, things like that. I actually like those better than I like sauna. If one is ill, or you just like them better than sauna generally. Oh, both actually. Oh, my first person ever met or come on this podcast to say you like baths in jacuzzi more than sauna. Yeah, absolutely. I may even do some ice. Probably not a ton though, because you get to be careful there. That's a big stressor. And if you're already over the line, you may be adding a pass there. Or I made I make a sleep. If I'm feeling very, very, very sleepy. And sometimes depending on what kind of a bug you get, that can happen. I will just sleep. And I might be the best choice you have. If that means you kicked the cold half a day earlier than that, then you just won in the aggregate. So that those are probably, it's a little bit of insight of the algorithm that I'm running with those things. Those are highly informative answers. Thank you. And I look forward to our discussion about recovery. So that we can go into even more depth on how to recover. The last thing I do want to say here is kind of going back to our quarter system. The examples I gave with the bulking up losing fat and getting into better fitness and cardiovascular fitness at the end. Those were just samples. Friends, please don't take that literally. If you want to emphasize strength more, put in some more strength. If you want to emphasize a different one of our nine adaptations, great. Do that too. If you're somebody who has a lot of body fat to lose, then maybe put that for two consecutive sessions or every other. You can modify them. We've talked about nine very specific training adaptations as well as in fat loss. I only gave you four, which is just meant to be a sample that you can roll in or out, but use those priorities to adjust that system according to what is important for you now. Five years and then 45 years down the line for whatever that may be. So if you're absolutely free to modify the order, you're absolutely free to modify the primary outcome. And then adjust the specifics within each quarter based upon what is needed to do to optimize that outcome. I think maybe one more tool we can offer people is maybe giving the individual week a little more structure. So the system I laid out is sort of like month by month and maybe we can lay out say a three day week workout. Program in a four day week program. That was still hits some of the same well rounded adaptations that probably covers. Maybe not individualized per bucket that we've talked about. A B and C, but it's going to cover 75, 80% of what would need to occur in all three buckets. And then you can use that last 25% for your individual goal or specialization. So maybe we can jump into that next. Great. Let's hear it. The first one I want to give you is just a basic three day split. That again, same idea. It's a well rounded exercise program. I actually wrote this all in an article that is on xpts website. So perhaps we can link directly that. I will just jump you straight to the answer. You can read more about why and details in that article if you'd like. But this is day one day two day three. You could do these days where you split them up. Actually having say 24 hours in between or you could do these back to back. It doesn't necessarily matter. In this particular case, say day one, you would start off and do a little bit of speed and power. And then you may finish that with a little bit of hypertrophy. Now, if you want to gain more speed and power, you just do more of it. If you want to maybe just do a little bit to touch it and you really want to gain some muscle, you would do more of an emphasis there. So the template can stay the same and you would just increase the amount of either adaptation that's speed and power stuff or the hypertrophy based on how high it is in your prior to list. Those are combined together because as we talked about earlier, they don't necessarily interfere with each other. You would do the speed and power stuff first because it wouldn't hamper the hypertrophy. If you did the hypertrophy first in that workout, it would probably compromise your speed and power. And in that case, you would actually not be getting your adaptation. So day one, you do that. And that could be a 20 minute workout total or a 2 1 1 a hour up to you. Then you would come back, maybe the next day or two days later, whatever you'd like to do, in your second day of exercise, you would start off with a pure strength protocol. And you would finish that with what I'm calling just a higher heart rate. So this could be something like our anaerobic capacity stuff. It could be the aerobic capacity, something where you're getting up to close to high heart rate. It could be those 22nd bursts. It could be a 92nd burst five minute, my repeat. Anything you like, you could just sort of plug and play this in. You're getting to a spot now where you've had a little bit of speed, a little bit of strength, a little bit of hypertrophy, and you've touched the high heart rate. So you've checked off most of the boxes already into sessions. Our last session then would be more of a steady state long duration endurance. And so three day weeks, but like that, is going to be a pretty nice set up for the average person. So this could be a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, what's happening on the intervening days? Totally off. If you want it to be. So I set this up as in the best I can give you, and these three days. Okay, great. If you have more, we could certainly improve it. But this was my worst case scenario I've got. Other things in my life, the most I could do for exercises three days a week. And given that it's three days for how approximately how long each of these workouts going to last. I would do whole body exercises for almost all that. I would do your full body parts. And I think you could certainly finish that in 45 minutes of work time. A little bit of time to warm up. Some downregulation at the end. You could be in and out of that gym in certainly under 60 minutes. The reality of the day is you could probably be out of there under 50 minutes. The total work time could be 30 35 once you get going. So that's three days as you pointed out, probably more work for week is going to be better in terms of maximizing goals of aesthetic goals and performance enhancing goals and longevity goals. Right? I mean, the numbers that I've heard that is that we should all try to get somewhere between 150 and probably more like 180 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week minimum. But as I recall, you consider zone two cardio so low intensity that just walking around is, you know, qualifies as really zone one zone two cardio. Yeah, not to take us too far off track, but it gets actually useful to differentiate what I consider to be exercise and physical activity. So physical activity is out for a walk. It is using a walking treadmill and while you're at work, it is, you know, parking farther in the parking lot and taking more steps. These are all important. And what's clear, you are not going to reach likely optimal health by only exercising hard and then sitting around the other 23 and a half hours today. So it's very, very important. Whether you want to do that in the form of zone one or zone two and hit 30 minutes a day. Various organizations will say things like that. You need to have 30 minutes a day of moderate low intensity exercise. I don't really care. You can combine it like that if you want. What you don't want to do is just physical activity, all my, which is almost always going to be like zone one to maybe zone two. You also don't want to go the other in the spectrum, which is again like I left hard three days a week and then what do you do the rest of the time nothing. That's not optimal either. And so I guess the system I've, I walked you through here are the example rather I walked you through is. You would need to maybe supplant that with being physically active. If you work, say you're in nurse and you're on your feet, you're moving up and down. You probably actually covering a decent amount of your physical activity because you might be at 15,000 steps a day. If you're sitting in front of your computer and you do this same three days split, you would probably need to go out of your a to make sure you're adding a bunch more steps. And so you might need to add several hours of walking to hit that 150, 180 minutes a week of physical activity. Because the program I laid out is, you know, if you're doing really 45 minutes three days a week, maybe 60 minutes at best you've hit 180. Terming out 60 minutes times three, 180 week. So you might actually need to then throw in maybe some more specific locks. So you could do that a number of ways. Could be again, actual structure exercise. It could be simply I'm going to do a 10 minute walk three times a day. It could be the exercise snacks that we talked about in a previous episode. So there's lots of ways to engage in more physical activity. But to me, those are different oftentimes in structured exercise. I think many people will appreciate that you put out there for us a three day a week protocol. Because many people simply don't have more time to exercise. They're putting emphasis on these other bins in the quadrant. And you know, frankly, those other bins are very important as well. So wonderful that people can check off some critical boxes for aesthetics and performance and longevity with three days of work or work out to per week I should say. What are some other schedules that people can follow if they're willing to dedicate a bit more time toward their fitness. Sure. If you wanted to do another sample of maybe a 40 week and again, to clarify this, this is I'm really happy you said that this is this is a four day week of structured exercise. This would not account your physical activity moving on. Which everybody should be doing absolutely. Maybe this is something like day one. You're going to do a strength training session and you'll stay in the five to ten or so repetition range a little bit of strength a little bit of hypertrophy. You've checked off a couple of boxes. Probably whole body so that you get all the body parts covered or close. We're looking at generally multi joint exercises could be combination of barbells, free weights, bands, machines, anything like that. Anything like that would be sort of day one. You could come back the very next day or you could wait for 24 hours. But the second day of your exercise would be maybe your long duration. This is actually sort of similar to how you set it up. It's you do a little bit of the inverse, but what you're kind of saying is I'm probably going to be a little bit sore from day one. And I don't have any free body parts that aren't sore. So instead of trying to do another lift or something, I'm just going to put in some restorative longer duration stuff. Same exact principles for long duration we just talked about could be a swim, could be any number of things could be your sport. Could be your out right the bike and go for a jog in the sun, whatever you would like to do. If you're feeling better, maybe that's a little harder longer. If you're feeling pretty beat up from the day before, maybe that's a little bit shorter and slower. You can modify it. Then maybe you take the next day off. Or that's open. Your third day of exercise is now instead of being that five to ten repetition range for your lift, you do something like eleven to thirty reps range. Also, this could be exchanged for something more like body weight, more muscular endurance type of stuff. So this is a great day, maybe it's yoga. Maybe it is a gymnastics thing you're working on or any of the many other styles of training that are not in quote unquote lifting weights. But they're not just walking and hiking. So it could be a Pilates or equivalent. Anything like this where you're going to get some muscular burn in there, but it's probably not any additional weight outside of body weight. Or if it is, it's fairly minimal, you know, five ten sort of fifteen pounds. Something like that would be nice. Could also be done in a circuit. So we could hit our high heart rate and we could hit some muscular endurance in there. Group activity class might be nice here. Even maybe something like a spin class or a dance class. All these things could be great. And then maybe you even finish that with ten minutes of some light weights. To hit the body part, you say didn't get so maybe you did the dance class. And then you finish and you do ten minutes of upper body sets of thirty to make sure you get you know, a nice pump there. And your legs probably got some work during the dance class, but your upper body didn't see a balance system out a little bit. So all body parts got a little bit of muscular endurance. Your heart rate got really high. Came back down and you sort of checked both of those boxes. Now it's important to remember the hypertrophy episode. Doing sets of say fifteen plus repetitions per set is as effective as doing sets of five to ten or ten times. Five to ten or twelve for hypertrophy gaining muscle. It's not effective though for strength gains. So you wouldn't want to do this only because you'd really be doing nothing to improve your muscle strength. And you want to make sure that that box is ticked at least a little bit. Then again you could take the day off after this or you could roll right into your fourth exercise day, which would be your last exercise session of the week. And you would do something more of like a medium intensity. So this is a little bit higher intensity than our second day. And this could be something like, you know, shadow boxing or hitting a heavy bag. It could be a little bit of higher intensity intervals but not all the way up. So maybe this is you're going to do a one minute on one minute off on the bike. But you're only going to go to like 85 90% heart rate. And then instead of going off during that one minute you drop it down to 50%. So we would actually look like 30 minutes of straight work, but you would have a little bit of rolling intensity as opposed to staying really nice and record restorative. It's going to be some work there. And you would finish it with something like five to six minutes total of max heart rate stuff, which lines up perfectly with that number you actually created in our endurance episode of hitting six minutes total per week. And then you would have to do a little bit of maximum heart rate or close. So you could wrap that all up kind of into one session. You could do those in the inverse order. Third of warm up. A few minutes, whether you want to do 30 second burst or a minute burst or straight five minutes. This is a protocol I like to use a ton on the assault bike is simply a good warm up 10 minutes solid warm up. And then I'm going to go five minutes and cover as much distance as I can in five minutes brutal it is brutal and it's amazing and you like you get a lot done in five minutes. Ten minutes on the back of that is a very gradual bring back to earth there. I actually in that case I don't need to do down regulation breathing because I've spent 10 minutes actually coming way back down and the last two minutes or so of that is very deliberate five second inhale through the nose. Five second exhale that the nose will not barely just moving and you end up being in a pretty good spot. So that again time wise could easily be done in 30 minutes and you'd be rounded off there. So the nice part about this four day week split as well as the three day week split is it does give you a little bit of flexibility. And so what I mean is maybe Monday your plan is to do the day one lift. And then any number of things popped up in life just ship it back to Tuesday. Rather than saying like Monday is like day and then all of a sudden something happened you miss like day it's just you're doing these things in order. And you would like to get all four done in a seven day span. But if it doesn't happen fine. The next day you get the workout you just go right back into the next workout and it doesn't matter what day they land on exactly. For the three day routine that works very nice because the assumption there is you really only have time for three workouts a week. And so that sort of implicit is there's probably some chaos happening in the schedule a little bit and you don't really have the ability to lock in three days for week. That's not the case you can go. But we're trying to listen to the pain points that people have with exercise and see if we can give them some solutions for those. Several things about this program were attractive to me. One of them you just mentioned which is that by not. Ridgely attaching individual workouts just to specific days of the week. One in theory could say okay was I didn't get that much sleep last night. I don't feel. I know that a lot of people say what what is feel but I don't feel recovered or like I'm going to get that much out of the the workout tomorrow. So I'm or today so I'm just going to push it forward today. And the the ability to slide workouts forward or back by day think is incredibly valuable. If for the consistency sake. I also really like this idea of some of the long duration work coming a day after hitting the strength and bit of high-perrophy work. So this would be the day two. One thing that I've experienced over and over is that if I'm very sore and a given muscle group especially my legs doing some low intensity cardio. Whether or not it's a jog or on the bike. Typically for me it's a jog or even even skipping rope and then walking skipping rope walking. It does seem to dissipate the soreness. I'm sure there's a mechanism for there has to be this mechanism for everything frankly. Yeah, but I like that arrangement. And then I also like this idea of making sure that there's a workout for muscular endurance because I feel like unless I've been stuck without a good gym. Or I've decided to specifically train body weight exercise which I did a few years ago. I got really excited about some of Pawel Sut Tool and work. Great stuff. Yeah, it's a make it the naked warrior which doesn't involve training naked although I suppose you could if you want to. It was really about no weight and involved building up to pistol squats and one arm push ups and things of that sort. Even doing pull ups on doors and I discovered that some door frames are much stronger than others. And I know it's all I just accidentally I caused some damage there but in any case muscular endurance I think is a really interesting one that I planned to incorporate into my schedule, but that is. I think is one that's often overlooked unless people really have an aversion to weights and to machines. You're right now it shouldn't be because it's pretty low hanging fruit. You don't need a lot of equipment for it typically. It doesn't hurt that bad you don't often get that sore out of it and you're going to feel a nice wonderful pump after. So it's great. But as we discussed many times now it is quite effective at hypertrophy. Yeah, I also I don't know if they fit specifically with musco endurance but if you look at the. The physics for example on a rock climbers. I mean they have to me of course they have usually the experience climbers have pretty remarkable. Body composition so they tend to be lean and lie and flexible all those things that many people aspire to. The other thing is their development always looks exceedingly balanced. You don't really tend to see climbers that are like overdeveloped in the torso and underdeveloped in the arms or overdeveloped in the arms despite all the climbing and underdeveloped and relatively in the other limb. That's true for women and men. It's not a sport that I participate in but. It seems like what they're doing is essentially muscular endurance. Yeah, so there's there's really something there to be valued. So that's a four day a week schedule with off days or rest days inserted as needed and then just continuing. For those that are a bit more committed to their fitness and want to do a five or six day week program. Would you recommend just collapsing some of the off days paying more attention to recovery and cycling through more quickly. Absolutely you could combine that and just run that either one of those programs so you could run that three day week program. Back to back. Did it get that done in six days. So day one speed power hypertrophy day two strength work with elevated heart rate intero capacity and day three endurance and then just and then just cycle through again. You take day four off of the week and then you go back again. So we would be having six days of exercise one day off and you'd be getting every one of those adaptations and multiple times a week. That is almost exactly how we would set up a six day week program great. I love the elegance and the simplicity of that and the thoroughness of it because it checks off so many if not all of the mid nine major adaptations to exercise that we've been talking about these episodes. And I suppose the one thing that I want to highlight and and post this also as a question is that. Early in our discussions in a previous episode you mentioned that so much of what people think of and apply as it relates to resistance training is borrowed from body building and hypertrophy training specifically which typically involves getting close to failure or failure sometimes even involving rest pause where you hit failure or then set the weight down for a few seconds and repeat these high intensity techniques you know accentuating the negative so called the centric. And that's that's it. And hearing about these protocols of three day a week or four day a week six day a week it's very clear to me that if one is not careful to omit that kind of thinking. And suddenly is taking their strength work in speed work to failure or is pushing too hard on muscular endurance to the point where you're just grinding out that very last push up on every set that the amount of soreness and the amount of recovery. Results from these workouts might start to cause progress issues so one thing that's in the back of my mind is as you've described these programs is that even though some of them are very brief or involve a minimum of time commitment. And particularly three day a week but also the four day a week schedule that there is a discipline involved in making sure that stick to the work out that you're supposed to do that day and not. Go ham as they say and just throw in a couple extra sets of bicep curls and tries to push is because you you want to do that and you thought you could maybe you could get away with that but you have to come back pretty quickly and do some serious. Meaning devoted speed and power work and or strength work and if you haven't been disciplined about not doing certain forms of exercise. I could see how the whole thing could kind of crash quickly and one could think oh this is just too much work or it's it's not for me. Yep. So this side suppose is now where the question comes which is what what are some of the key points that people need to keep in mind when they embrace a program. How originally do they need to stay attached to you know it today's endurance day. I'm just doing indirect today's strength day. I'm just doing strength work. I'm not going to take things to absolute failure or be on failure. I am absolutely happy with anyone modifying any of the sample programs. However, they would like to my only recommendation for the question you just posed. Would be set your program and then if you're going to make a change fine, but that is a change to your program. In other words, don't just make decisions every single day and make changes. If you're doing that, you might as well not have a program and as we described earlier there is clear evidence that having a program is better than not regardless of the effectiveness of the program. And so my general comment to that is okay fine. A day or two, you made some modifications. No problem. We're in a situation now where it's like your basically changing the workout every day as you go. Then we just need to read a right-on-o-o program. We need to reassess what we're at because we need to have some structure. Look, the reality of it is, I change the programming I'm going to do the day of often because of any number of situations I just don't feel like it. I way overestimated today. We talked a little bit in a previous episode about auto regulation, which is a style of a peer-to-satient program design which you're adjusting based on how you're actually feeling that day. But with some specific structures, you're going to take some measurements that day and adjust. So auto regulation is a very, very effective tool. You just need to make sure that that auto is dialed. In other words, is it because your body actually needed something different or is it because you're now just getting a little bit lazy? Now you're just not feeling like it today. So there's a little bit of an impossible line to draw there. Both scenarios are real, great area. A lot is real in the moment. And so you just need to be a little bit aware of having some reality check. Listen to your body, but then also being like, hey, no, I'm talking to you. I'm telling you this is a plan we're going to do this and staying within it. It is going to be challenging to progressively overload. And therefore, get a higher likelihood of success in your training program. If you're just making decisions and changing the program right before you work out, you're probably not. You're probably going, for most people, you're probably going to choose less or off more so than you choose more. Now having said that, there are more than a few clients that have come through our programs where they choose more, always. They add a set, they add an exercise, they add in another workout. And that can be okay, but we're going to attract various markers on them. And if we see these things consistently going down, we're going to identify whether they are which phase of this overtraining thing we'll talk about next. They're actually in. Some phases, I'm okay. Some of them I'm not. And for seeing certain things happen physiologically, we're going to make a conversation. We're also then going to really think carefully about why are you making this choice. Do you feel like the training is enough? Okay, great. Let's modify it then. Are you not making progress or are there some other reasons why you're doing this? Obviously, I'm not a psychologist with therapists, but there are clearly situations in which folks endorse themselves with far too much exercise for. And there are reasons that are not because it's productive to their training or goals. And if such case, we would probably bring in somebody that specializes in those areas to clear that out. And just make sure it's like we're not doing this for anxiety issues or energy things like if it's I just don't think the programs enough. Okay, great. Let's go back. Let's look at our metrics. Let's evaluate our tests and go there. But if there's other reasons and we may bring in somebody to have that conversation. Usually when I've seen people deviate from programs, because they tend to revert to something that they've done for a long time, it just feels really comfortable to them. And it worked. And it was giving them decent results. So they're skeptical to try something else. Or there is a phenotype of kind of haphazardness. Sometimes, especially if we get really caffeinated before workout and just want to throw something in. And then there's a third category. And this is one that I've had to contend with a lot in my life, which is that I really enjoy training with other people when I have the opportunity. And certain day rolls around where you're supposed to do something and not do other things. And people say, hey, do you want to go for a long-distance swim or you want to train and you end up doing some, you know, Can he came this once for you some ridiculous, you know, 20 wallball crossfit type workout. And I'm not acclimated for that sort of thing. And then it does tend to throw things off. Not because I'm no pun intended, Kenny, because there's nothing wrong with a 20 sets of wallballs if you're that's part of your conditioning. But if it's not appropriate for where you are in your schedule, it really can disrupt what you're trying to do. Yeah, even as a non-competitive athlete like myself. Years since I've competed in any athletic program, but the as a non-competitive athlete, I think there's a beauty to and a really strong incentive to being disciplined about the program that one follows. And it's a mentor and professor that I worked with years ago used to say, come into his office all these ideas and things I want to do in the heat say, let's constrain this walk. And then you, you know, the question you always want to arrive at in a discussion with your students as you know is what's the experiment exactly. And then you go and you do that specific experiment. I think I view a workout the same way that they're multiple with adaptations, it goals and things that people are trying to achieve really knowing why you're there each time and really sticking to that. And then if it means not training with other people or I always say well you can train with me, but I'm not going to train with you. So that's one way to do it. But really sticking to a schedule is really what allows the progress to emerge, but that doesn't necessarily being anti-social. You can invite people along. But in this case, I'm telling people to be the host not the guest. I have a little bit of a rule here. Maybe I should answer your question this way. I actually like doing things totally different occasionally. I'm traveling. I tend to do hotel workouts. What I mean with that is I will go down to the workout room. And I will do a set of 10 to 15 reps of every single machine in the exact order in which they are laid out. Well, just for the sake of fun, like just for the sake of like a terrible card version of what else. So whatever comes up, I'm going to make sense of it. And you just move. Yeah. And those are typically things if like I just want to move a little bit for jet lag and other sort of purposes, right? That's often like I wasn't going to get to work out today. And so now I'm going to do something to feel great. I don't travel that much though. So it's not really throwing my things off. I also, I don't get a lot of free time. And so if I am traveling and I'm seeing someone I haven't seen in many years or for the first time, I mean, we got to train together this week the first time. I'm not going to burn that opportunity. My rule is this though. I'm not going to do something that's going to cost me more than three days. So I'm absolutely happy to get out there and maybe tomorrow morning or tonight. We go do some fun that's off my schedule. I'm in 100%. I'm just going to downregulate a little bit. I'm not going to maybe do as much as you or as hard as you or whatever. I'll do more than I should. But if it cost me tomorrow, it was worth the exchange. I don't have a world record. I'm setting anytime soon. I don't have, I got many years. I'm happy to give up a couple of days of exercise to be a little sore that I need to be for the exchange of a lifetime memory. And this stuff is so important to me. This stuff lands like true lifetime memories. So I can look back many of my fond memories from my life are training sessions with friends, whatever. It's like doing to just do with somebody who's a world champion. We just like told, whatever the thing is right here. Like that was really really cool. Absolutely worth missing two days. It's going to be more than three days though. I'm going to be so wrecked. I can't work out for five or six days. Then I'm probably like, all right, that's kind of nonsense. Unless it's just an opportunity where I absolutely can't pass up. So that's kind of how I think about it. That doesn't happen too often with me though. Maybe once a month and so I might, okay, I'll find a last day. Really, if it is, it's probably one like once a quarter. But that happens so I don't really care. So you do want to balance joy and life. You don't want to be so rigid about your training program that it ruins and robes as experience. Physical activity should be. Fun. Your fitness and your training should be something that makes your life better. Not some task. You have to get done so that 75 years from now. You've hit some metric of who knows what. Just alone in your room with your training logs. No, you want, in all seriousness, I think you point to the richness of the life and you can draw these boxes like work, relationships, subitness or cover, but the boundaries between those boxes are blurry because I'm not, and I should say I love training with you. I greatly enjoyed training with you this morning, not just because I was receiving so many useful tips. In fact, thank you for some of my PR and a number of things today. Thanks to your input in the moment, that's a replaceable kind of gift. But mostly it's the gift of getting to train with a colleague and friend. So I want to underscore highlight and put an explanation mark behind what you just said. Thank you once again and again for giving us so much interesting clear, actionable. And at time somewhat counterintuitive information in order to build out an exceptional training program to meet any of and in some cases all of the nine major adaptations that exercise can create toward aesthetic, performance related and health span lifespan, okay, longevity goals. This really a treasure trove of information there. And I look forward to our next discussion about how to best recover from exercise both within the exercise bout and between exercise bout and in the more macroscopic structure of a week, a month a year. I can't wait. I love that topic and I've got a lot to cover. So it'll be fun. If you're learning from Endor and Join this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube channel.

vid00005," Welcome to the Human Lab guest series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and optymology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode is the third in the six episode series on fitness, exercise, and performance. Today's episode is all about endurance and fat loss. That is, the specific protocols required to achieve the four different kinds of endurance and how to maximize fat loss. Dr. Andy Yelp and great to be back. Today we're going to talk about endurance, and I'm very interested in this conversation because I like many other people strive to get a certain amount of cardiovascular work in each week. Maybe a long-ish jog, maybe a swim, ride the bike, etc. But when I think about the word endurance, the idea that almost immediately comes to mind is about doing something for a long period of time repeatedly. But I have a feeling that there are other ways to trigger this adaptation that we call the endurance adaptation. I'm excited to learn about that. I'm also excited to learn about the fuel systems in the body that allow for endurance and other modes of repeated activity. So in order to kick things off, I'd love for you to frame the conversation by telling us what is endurance, and are there indeed a large variety of ways to induce what we call this endurance adaptation? Sure. The way I want to start actually here is calling back to some of the things we talked about in our previous conversations, which are really, people exercise for three reasons. For one, you want to feel better. Number two, you want to look a certain way. And then number three, you want to be able to do that for a long time. So you need the way that we say it, and sports is look good, feel good, play good. So I want some sort of functionality to be able to perform a certain way whatever that is for you. You want to be able to look a certain way that whatever that matters for you. And then you want to be able to do that for a long time. So when it comes to endurance, we have a bunch of misnomer here, which is the same thing with the strength training of resistance exercise side. We're wanted to dispel this myth that I lift weights only because I want to gain muscle or play a sport. And I want to do cardio because I want to lead their loose fat or for long health sake. And just like we smash that myth from the strength training side, I want to smash it from the endurance training side. There are so many other reasons that you want to perform endurance training. Regardless of your goal, whether it is longevity, whether it is performance or whether it is aesthetics. And so we're going to, I want to cover all those reasons exactly what to do protocols, of course, and why those things are working that way. In general, though, the quick answer is really endurance comes down to two independent factors. Factoring number one is fatigue management. And then factor number two is fueling. And that's all that really comes down to. So all the different types of training are going to reach a limitation, which are either again your ability to deal with. Some sort of fatigue. And that's generally a fatigue signal. The other one is managing some sort of restriction of energy input. And a lot of the, the, the, the, the other here is a lot of the times people think it's a fueling issue and really. It's a fatigue management issue or the opposite. And to have a complete health spectrum, regardless of whether you're a high performance athlete like I typically deal with. Or general public, you need to be able to do both manage fatigue as well as understand fuel storage. So that's really what we're going to get into today. Fantastic. I can't wait. Before we dive in, I'm going to ask you what I often ask people who are expert in their respective fields, which is, is there any. Non obvious tool or mechanism or tool and mechanism that can allow people to access better endurance. You know, when I think about training for endurance, again, I just think about trying to run longer and longer each week. Yeah, we're swim further and further and further and so on. But I do wonder whether or not there are other forms of training that can amplify the endurance adaptation that I or most people perhaps don't think of as endurance. Sure. The way I want to answer this is if we look back and think about how we've answered that question with power and strength and force production. Because really about how much can you produce maximally once. What you're asking now is how can I repeat that same quality of performance? If that's the case, endurance really comes down to your ability to maintain proper mechanics. That's going to like the biggest way we can increase your endurance exponentially very quickly is mechanical. And this is starting with breathing. And so we need to be breathing properly. We need to have proper posture and positions and then we need to be moving well. Efficiency is going to trump force always for endurance. The other side of the question is not that you can have a little bit of leaks in your mechanics and still squat well or jump high and be fine. Because you don't have to suffer those consequences repeatedly. Right. That's going to drain you over time. So the quickest way to improve endurance is to improve mechanics and mechanical thing. I'll go after first is your breathing techniques. You're patting your entire approach as well as your posture. And then from there the third one would be your movement technique. Is it possible to describe the best way to breathe when doing endurance training or is it far more complex than that? And if it is far more complex than that then certainly we can get into it during today's episode. Yeah, it is both of those. I will give you a quick answer though. A lot of the times you can kind of hit the cheat code which is nasal breathing. There's plenty of times when you don't want a nasal breath. There don't need to nasal breath. But just again, is that like a one tool that is a pretty general answer. If you can do that, a lot of the times that will fix breathing mechanics just by default. And we can maybe talk about why that is later. But that would be my sort of one sentence bullet point answer immediately of how to get in the right position. So second one would be simply looking at your posture. Right. So whether you're on a bike or you're doing a lift or you're running. If you're literally hunched over and your ribs are touching your femur or getting closer and closer like tends to happen on a bike or an aerosol thing for somebody I've seen recently. This morning I was on the assault bike doing a sprint and I asked Andy Dr. Galpin to critique my form and anything else he wanted to critique. So that I could improve and he did comment on my rather C shaped posture. I'm encouraging me to be more upright, which I should probably do now as well. And he also cured me to the fact that during a one minute sprint there is something that is quote unquote magic that happens right about the 40 second mark. And I use that as a as a milestone to look for and indeed something does happen at the 40 second into a one minute sprint where all of a sudden it does seem to get much easier for a reason that I'm going to do. I have seen it for a reason I don't understand. Maybe you can tell that but it certainly had nothing to do with my posture. My posture needs improvement. Yeah, well, yeah. So breathing mechanics and breathing strategies people tend to be over breathing early on and this is going to lead to problems later. So having a more strategic breathing pattern and approach is again a very quick solution. that we are going to dive very deep into the mechanisms of energy and metabolism and endurance today. But as long as we're having a discussion about these brief tidbits of how to improve endurance, are there any other ways to improve endurance that are of relatively short time investment, even if they require a lot of energy? Sure. Classic paradigm we're going to find here is steady state long duration, posed up against what a lot of folks will now call higher intensity, interval training specifically. And there's a lot of misconceptions here that quick answer is you need to be doing both. And there's probably a bunch of stuff in between that you should be practicing. If you honestly want to maximize those three factors we talked about at the beginning, you need to be training across this full spectrum. Just like I told you to train across the full spectrum of your lifting, we want to be doing the same thing here. So are there independent special factors that can happen with the shorter time length, higher intensity stuff, absolutely? There's also magic that happens on the other end of that spectrum. So it's very important that people don't just choose one side because what tends to happen is people either go with the all-menagerie 30 or 45 minutes of steady state stuff. That's it. Or I'm going to do the opposite, which I'm going to lead that stuff on the table, not do it because I only want to do high intensity intervals because I can get it done in five minutes. There's magic on both sides of the equation. We want to get into all of that. But just to answer your question directly, there's a whole bunch of things you can do in under one minute that are convenient to do. And there's a wonderful set of papers out of a couple of laboratories in Canada that championed this idea that's called exercise snacks. So there's a bunch of, there's a series of studies that have been done here that are really interesting. And they've looked at a couple of things that are noteworthy. One of them is a 20-second bout of all-out work. And this has actually done in workers in an office. And so what they had them do is run upstairs. I believe it was about 60 steps is what it took them. Something along the order of 20 seconds exactly. And they repeated that about once every four hours. So really it's just you go to work, you get, you know, put your coffee and your bag down and whatever. You run up a flight of stairs 20 seconds later than you go right back to work at lunch and before you go home, you're so great. If you repeat that, that's multiple times a week. You're going to do that. I think they, in one of the interventions it was three times a week for six weeks. 18 total times you did that. And what you'll see is a noticeable improvement is statistically significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness, specifically VO2 Max. As well as a number of cognitive benefits, work productivity, et cetera. That can happen in as little as 20 seconds. You don't have to go to the gym. You don't have to shower. You don't have to do anything like that. Just find the stairs, run up and down them a few times. Now you may have noticed you actually sort of caught me yesterday. I did that right here, right? I was just I, we had a little bit of a break. I was feeling an energy law. I ran up the stairs three or four times, filled a lot better. So that can actually also help. They ran another study. When they looked at that following a giant high glycemic index meal. And what they saw, and then they took insulin measures and a whole bunch of other biological markers associated that you want to be pay attention to with the high glycemic index meal. And they looked at those immediately an hour, three hours, six hours as a post. And it was very clear that same intervention was able to improve post-plandial glucose control, insulin, and a whole bunch of other factors in addition to that. So if you are the type who's like, wow, I'm in an office all day. Maybe also how to giant high glycemic index meal. Not the best approach, but a little bit of mitigation there can just be running up a flight of stairs or doing something like that for as little as 20 seconds. So there's a lot of magic and power and maximal exertion. If one does not have access to a flight of stairs at work, could they do jumping jacks? Absolutely. I mean, you could do anything you really wanted. It's not the mode of exercise that matters here. It is simply the exertion. You just get up as hard as you can. You could do burpees. You could do any number of things. You could sprint down your road down the hallway back and forth. The mode is just something that was easy for the scientists to control. X number of steps, people could do it, you're not going to fall, hurt yourself, things like that. Just to remind me, it's one every four hours, one minute of all the seconds. 20 seconds, excuse me. 20 seconds of essentially all-out exertion while remaining safe, not going so fast up the stairs or doing jumping jacks. So it's not down the stairs. Up the stairs, please. Escalators don't count. Well, I suppose they count if you're moving, if you're not remaining on the same steps. In fact, in an airport recently, I saw somebody walking against the conveyor while talking on the phone while waiting for their flight to take off. It's genius, right? It looked a little awkward. Who cares? Yeah. But it was, I have looked awkward in every airport I've been in for the last 15 years. For those exact reasons, doing wild stuff like that. Yeah. Well, nothing's more awkward than not being able to walk to the end of the terminal simply because one isn't familiar with walking that far, carrying a couple of suitcases. There you go. Yeah, that's the other fit test. The suitcase carrier. Yeah. I love the airport. I love this. So once every four hours, 20 seconds. So maybe once when arriving to work, once four hours in and then four hours, I must be probably at work somewhere, you know, eight plus or minus two hours. Now, one thing I actually really want to make clear because your audience is so incredible. They tend to be really excited about these protocols and they follow them exactly as written. That's not exactly how science works. So it doesn't necessarily have to be every four hours. It's in half three three times a day. It doesn't have to be 20 seconds. They literally built that protocol because it was through the trying to replicate a real life scenario. Maybe you're in an office building. You're generally there for eight hours. Let's see if you did want every sort of at the. So if you want to do it four times a week, great. If you can do it only 10 seconds, amazing. You're probably going to get the same benefits. Those are not the details to pay attention to. The detail that pay attention to is every so often multiple times a day, try to get your heart rate up really quickly. Doesn't require sweating. Does it require anything else? There's no warm-up associated with it. Again, you need a minute break in between meetings or whatever and you can sprint up them. I do this all the time in my house. When you're, you know, have those days when you're on like seven straight hours of zooms, etc., you can get out of 20 seconds. I run to my garage, which is over there. I hop on the, they air by and I will just smash out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then walk right back in. Love it. Yeah. I'm going to start. Yeah, just also you can just put one of those things which I do also just put one in your office. And hop over right over there. It, you know, the whole entire thing now literally takes 23 seconds. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpins teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is, however, part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Momentus. Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentus for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations. With single ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, Momentus Supplement Ship internationally, and this is of course important because we realize that many of the Huberman Lab podcasts listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the Huberman Lab podcast, in particular supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery, you can go to Live Momentus spelled OUS so that's LiveMementus.com slash Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor. Many people are aware that their blood sugar, that is their blood glucose level, is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body. Most people do not know however, how different foods and different activities, including exercise, or different temperature environments impact their blood glucose levels. And yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things. I first started using levels about a year ago as to how different foods exercise and timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night impact my blood glucose levels. And I've learned a tremendous amount from using levels. It's taught me when best to eat, what best to eat, when best to exercise, how best to exercise, and how to modulate my entire schedule from work to exercise and even my sleep. So if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying to continue to glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link slash Huberman. That's a levels.link slash Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by element. Element is an electrolyte drink that contains exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium to optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance. Most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best. But what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of ourselves and nerve cells neurons in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios. Now of course, people with pre-hypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake. But what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise, and in particular if you're falling a very clean diet, that is not a lot of process foods, which of course is a good thing. Chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams, that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drink element that's LMNT.com slash human to get a free element sample pack with your purchase.

When we think about endurance, I would like to open up the conversation to include more things than people generally do when they hear the word endurance. So if we just think about what you typically ask your body to do, or would like to ask your body to do, and we just walk through them, it's going to be things like this. Number one, I want to have energy throughout the day. That's actually a form of endurance. Great. I don't want to have these laws and fatigue, and I want to feel fantastic as I move throughout my activities of daily living, whatever those may be. Work, exercise, and join me, paying attention and focus all that stuff. Great. That's one thing. Another thing you want to ask your body to do is I want to be able to repeat some small effort in a muscle group and not, and feel great about that. This is what we generally call muscular endurance. So this is something like I want to be able to lock up those 10 flights of steps, and my quads aren't burning at the end of it, right? Or it's even gives me energy. Another thing you want to ask your body to do is to be able to perform a tremendous amount of work for a longer period time, something in the realm of 20 to 80 seconds. So this could be something like, if you're surfing, and you've got a paddle extremely hard for a minute to get on top of a wave, or you're outwriting your bike, and you need to be able to get up a hill, and it's a very steep hill. These are going to take maximal efforts for some small amount of time, and then you'll get back up there. We tend to call that maximum anaerobic capacity. So the maximum amount of work you can perform at a high rate for some amount of seconds to like maybe a minute. Pass that is your ability to repeat an effort kind of like that for something like 5 to 15 minutes. And this is the example would be run a mile, right? Some interval like that, which is a longer distance, right? That is going to be a maximum aerobic capacity. Another thing you're going to want your body to do is we call sustained position. So this is, you want to be able to sit in your chair at work and have perfect posture for 20, 30, 40 minutes, right? You want to be able to stand in line at a grocery store for 15 minutes and not have a breakdown in posture. So you want to be able to maintain position when you're writing your bike, you're not collapsing, you're doing any of these activities, and you don't get hurt, or lose efficiency simply because you couldn't sustain basic positions. All right, whatever those shapes and positions need to be. And then the last one is a maximum distance. So we want to be able to go for a longer hike, or have just a long day at Disneyland for whatever it needs to be, and feel great at the end of it. Right? So the goal with all of these things is not can you just do them, but can you do them and then you feel good afterwards? So we're back in a right position where they give you energy, you feel good about it, and it's not just something you had to do when you're a gridded and you felt awful. So those are the factors I think about when someone says, I want better endurance is I want to walk backwards is okay, when you stand, endurance, what do you mean? And that's generally the things I've come across as if you can handle all of those things. You're going to feel like you're in fantastic shape. You're going to feel your recovery is going to be excellent, and your physical performance in the gym or any of this sporting activities you do will be enhanced. Given what you told us a little bit earlier, that endurance really reflects fatigue management and energy production. How do each and both of those things relate to endurance at a mechanistic level? So really what I'm asking is what is fatigue management and what is energy production? In order to do that, it's important that we understand all of those functional capacities that I just talked about. They all have different points of failure. So in order to then work backwards and say, well how do I optimize my performance and all those we need to go through each one and figure out where am I failing? Some of them are going to be failing because of fatigue management and some of them will be failing because of energy production issues. So if we walk through a little bit of how we make energy and how we handle fatigue, then we're going to have a better understanding of exactly what to do for each one of these categories. If you feel like one of them in particular is worse for you or lagging behind or if in general you just want to improve all of them. All right, now I want to make a little bit of a nine degree turn here. I'm going to do a strategy that I promise and I want to ask you a very simple question. How do you lose weight? I was taught that the calories in calories out thermodynamics of energy utilization governs most everything. That is if I'm ingesting less caloric energy than I burn, then I'm going to lose weight. And if I'm ingesting exactly as much as I burn, I'll maintain weight and if I ingest more than I burn, then I'll gain weight. Sure, that is the approach you would take. What I'm asking really is how will you actually physically losing the weight? So my understanding is that we have different fuel sources in the body, glycogen, which is stored in muscle and liver body fat, which is stored in mainly white adipose tissue and which is subcutaneous in around our organs, intravisual fat, and that we can also use protein as a fuel. And then as I recall there's also a phosphocreatine system. And I think you're going to tell me that each of these systems is tapped into on different time scales and perhaps according to different levels of exertion. And I'm certain that what I just said is not exhaustive, but hopefully it is most or entirely correct. Pretty correct. What's I got to do with fat loss? At some point, body fat stores, adipose, adipose sites, fat cells are going to start liberating fat as a fuel source. And the stimulus for that, I'm assuming is going to be that other fuel sources are either depleted or that the energy and metabolic systems of the body, I don't want to say decide because they don't have their own consciousness or are flipsignal in a way that registers that body fat would be the optimal fuel source given how long or endore intensely a given activity has been performed. Okay, we have some stuff to clean up there, but we're still not really answering the question. How am I actually losing that body fat? How is it actually leaving the body correct? My understanding is that it leaves the body through respiration. Aha. So now we have some interesting things to talk about. How am I actually losing fat via respiration? What the hell is that even mean? How is something that occupied this physical space on the side of me leaving my body through my mouth? And that is a very clear answer there, right, which I'm sure you're queued up to. When you take a breath in, you're generally breathing in oxygen. Oh, too. There's some other things, but what's the stick to oxygen? When you exhale, you're breathing out CO2. The difference between those two is that carbon molecule. Well, one of the things that's important to understand here is all of your carbohydrates, which is those that word itself is a carbon that has been hydrated. So it is a carbon molecule attached to a water molecule. It is a simple chain of carbons. Your fat molecules are also chains of carbon. All of Metabolism really in terms of energy production is simply trying to figure out a way to break those carbon bonds as a result we get energy from that way. Use that energy to create a molecule called ATP, which is the central source of energy for any living being. That carbon is then floating around a free form, which is bad news internally. So we've got to figure out a way to get that carbon out of our system. So all of energy production, all of fatigue management really comes down to this core issue of how are we handling carbon and how are we moving it around the body. And so what we do is we do this sneaky thing. So another question I like to ask people is why do we breathe? Well, for two reasons to bring oxygen into the system and to offload carbon dioxide, but the neural trigger for breathing is when carbon dioxide hits a threshold level in the set of neurons in the brainstem and elsewhere, activate the frenic nerve or the gas reflexor or combination of things and we inhale or inhale. Right. So a reduction of oxygen intake generally doesn't stimulate ventilation unless you're at altitude. Then that's sort of changes. In general, it's an elevation in CO2 that's going to stimulate breathing out. The only reason you bring in CO2 for the most part is to get rid of the CO2. Oxygen is not a fuel source. It works the same with fire, by the way. So you know you have to have oxygen present for a fire to go and if you use quelt oxygen, the fire will go out. That's sort of half of how those like fire extinguishers work. But we think then that means oxygen is the fuel. It is not the fuel. It is something entirely. It is a necessary product that is necessary for the metabolism process to actually occur. All right. So we're kind of dancing around an idea here, which is this carbon cycle of life. So what happens in plants is they generally will breathe in the opposite and breathe out the opposite of human. So a plant will breathe in CO2 and exhale, O2. This is why we have to have a certain amount of these things in algae and forests and trees and stuff to maintain this O2 CO2 balance in our atmosphere. We do the opposite. So we have this wonderful circle of life. We breathe in O2, breathe out CO2, they do the opposite. What happens is because carbohydrates are long chains of carbon and fats are as well. Generally when we think about fats, by the way, it's important to understand that structure a little bit. So if we think about triglycerides, it is a three carbon backbone chain of glycerol, so it's one, two, three. And horizontally running off of each one of those are fatty acid chains. So we form this structure that looks like an E, like the letter E, three in the back and then three chains coming off of it. Each of those chains are called fatty acids and each of those fatty acids are a length of carbon. A number of carbon strong together. However, many carbons are there determines which type of fatty acid it is. So steric acid, like I asked like any different number of things. It's also what determines whether or not is a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. As if carbon requires a special thing called a double bond. So if there's a double bond across a recarbon carbon, then they're all fully saturated in your grade. If there's any of them that are not double bonded, in fact, an example if there is one that doesn't have a double bond, that is now called monounsaturated. If there are many, it is called polyunsaturated. So there's pros and cons of all these things. Right. In either case, we're still talking long carbon chains. So what a plant will do is bring in carbon. And then it has this wonderful ability to use energy from the Sun called photosynthesis. And it can take those carbons that it in hails and use the energy from the Sun to form a bond. Now in our prior discussion, when we're going over hypertrophy, we talked about the energy that was required to go through protein synthesis. That's because forming a new atom, our new bond between atoms oftentimes takes energy. In this case, it does. The same thing happens here. So if a plant does not have oxygen or does not have carbon dioxide in the air, it has no fuel. That basically think about it is that's what it eats. It needs to get nitrogen from the ground in the soil. It's like we need to get nitrogen from our protein. But fuel lies in these to get carbon dioxide. Then it needs Sun to give it energy so that it can actually form that bond. Right. That's what is getting its fuel from. Right. So if we think about a classic plant that produces either a starch or a fruit, here's what happens. It in hails that carbon in a discharge packing it away. Now in a root vegetable, what it does is it stores those things together. And if we store that thing, we grow fruit at the bottom of it. We tend to call those things starches. It's going to then take the carbon that is packed away in its root and send it up the tree. And it's going to actually do that by breaking it down into a smaller form of carbohydrate that we tend to often call things like sucrose and glucose. It'll ship that up the tree. It'll go out to the leaves and it'll convert it into the fruit. And it's going to eventually transform that stuff into smaller carbon things called fruit dose. And if we think about the fruit, are the sugar in fruit. It's often in the form of fruit dose or sucrose or a combination in sometimes glucose. So we have these smaller carbon, six carbon chains generally in the form of glucose that are being made from this larger storage of carbohydrates that we call starch. Right. So it's packed in together. Your body does the exact same thing. So if it's a potato and it has a whole bunch of glucose packed away, we call that starch. If it's in your quadricep and we pack about a whole bunch of glucose away, we now call it glycogen. If it's in your blood as that six carbon chain, we call it glucose. If it's in the tree and in the fruit, we call it fruit dose. Right. Those are different molecules. But that's effectively the same thing happen. So the biology, the chemistry is almost identical. It just runs in the reverse order. And that's why again, at tubers and potatoes and stuff tend to be starches and fruits tend to be glucose, fruit dose and sucrose. So we have this wonderful circle of a lie. The plants can survive on just breathing in the CO2 and then getting the energy from the sun. We don't have that ability, at least to my knowledge to run through photosynthesis. So the only way we can get carbon into our system is to actually ingest carbon. Which means we have to eat the starch the fruit, the animal, some other form of stored carbon to get that into our system. We then pack that away. We put the carbohydrates, as you mentioned earlier, either on our liver, our blood, or in our muscles. We put the fat generally in adipostation. We'll put a little bit in muscle cells as in from muscular tractless rides. And then the protein will use as structure. Right. We to do different things. We don't like to use protein as material or fuel. It's better use of structure. And what we have to do then is if all the sun we realize that storage is getting too much in our body. In other words, we're gaining too much weight. We have to figure out how to get the carbons out of our body. And that is metabolism. Right. Anytime we're trying to break a carbon bonds that we can get energy to make ATP, that's going to release the carbon out of our tissue and the blood. We have to bring in oxygen to bind that carbon molecule to make CO2 so we can exhale it and put it back into the atmosphere. It's a beautiful description of the circle of life and energy utilization in the human body. I have to ask the question that I'm sure many people are wondering about, which is, if indeed we exhale these carbons. And as it relates to fat loss, that is the way that we lose fat if we're in a sub-chloric state, for instance, has it ever been explored as to whether increasing the duration or intensity of excels can accelerate fat loss? I mean, that's sort of the logical extension of what you described. And here, I'm actually interested equally in whether or not the answer is yes, as well as whether it could be no. Because I could imagine if the answer is yes, well then there's some interesting protocols to emerge from that, but that if it's no, it will reveal to us some important bottlenecks about metabolism and energy utilization. You've ever seen those magicians who like to show up and they can tell your mom's name or something like that before you because they can sort of, oh, I got a path. Yeah, I mean, not to take us down a deep dive tangent, but I once went to the magic castle in Los Angeles and I was one of the people called up front and an incredible magician, a named, I think his name was Ozzy Minder, something. I think that's right, had me write my name on a card in a sharpie pen. I ripped up the card. I ripped it up. I put it in my pocket and at the end of the 10 or 15 minute bow of him doing a bunch of other tricks, he asked me to look in my right shoe and under my foot in my right shoe was that card intact. Yeah. And it was no longer in my pocket and I swear my life I wasn't a collaborator with it. And to this day, it still gives me chills because it bought, I don't know how I magic. Yeah, right magic. Well, the reason I say that is I've given that little spiel that I just gave you countless times of my classes. And I was say 99% of the time, as soon as I stopped, the very first question is, so can I just like do a bunch of exhales and lose fat? Which is wonderful because I was really hoping you would do that and you rolled right into my trap. You landed perfectly. So I look like a magician over here. I feel like I should look in my right shoe right now. No, I asked the question because it's the logical extension of what you laid out. But I know biology to be both diabolical and cryptic but also exquisite in the way that things are arranged and you don't get something for nothing. There are no free passes in physiology. That's the saying no free passes. The answer to your question is yes, a 100% yes. In fact, that is the only way to go about it. You have two options. You can ingest less carbon or you can expel a more carbon. People always say calories in calories out. It's really carbon in carbon out. That's what a calorie is. calories in amount of energy we get for breaking carbon bond. So it's really less in, less more out, less in is fairly obvious whether that comes in any form. And by the way, this is exactly why the percentage of your intake coming from fans or carbohydrate is such. It doesn't really matter that much. If you look at fat loss, clinical trials, you guys may have covered this. When Lane was in here, I'm sure this is something he talks about a lot. It doesn't matter. It's irrelevant because it's not about that. There's nothing magic in those things. They are different. They have different physiological responses. Everything is different, right? No, God. But in general, it's simply about carbon intake. Turns out fat has a lot more carbons per mole than carbohydrates do. So there's more calories per mole in there. So if you the physical amount of fat needs to come in a smaller amount, there's a amount of carbohydrates. It needs to come in, it will come in as a larger amount. But you can play any number of very high carb, low fat, what matters? Total calories, right? Again, it's not like the only thing that matters. But you know what I'm saying? Some percentages in the way can go fat loss works fantastic, high fat, low carbohydrate, why? Why do all of these things work? Because this is not about that. It's about total intake of carbon, total expel. So absolutely, can you lose fat by simply ex-haling more? In fact, that is exactly what you did this morning. When I hopped on the air time bike for what? When you did anything, right? The question is, can you think of a scenario in which you could have a bunch of increased rates of exhalation? That helps in fallence. Sure. I think of a lot of things those to me like increased rates of inhalation. One thing could be simply going to be a problem. Right? So the question is, can I literally do some breath protocols where I force exhal and lose fat? And the answer is yes. But what happens? What happens if you do hyperventilation training? Well, my lab studies, sickly hyperventilation is one of our many deliberate protocols. And one of the most prominent things that one observes is that levels of adrenaline increase very quickly. Extremely quickly. People feel jittery, anxious, stressed. And unless they are consciously trying to anchor, they're thinking about what that means and the benefits that to persisting. Typically, they abort the sickler hyperventilation protocol really quickly. Within seconds, right? You will feel tingling, sweating, all kinds of things. You're hyperventilating, right? And we could we could talk an awesome about how that changes everything from adrenaline to focus the whole bunch of things. So unfortunately, a strategy of sitting around just exhaling more than you inhale, technically helps you lose more fat, but it's not going to last very long. So then the question is, well, how do I get into a situation or scenario in which I can increase my rate of expiration? Or I'm not going to pass out. I'm not going an altering hypercompanied hypercompanied issues. Any idea of a situation in which you would have an enhanced rate of explanation without worrying about passing out through a steady state exercise or not steady state exercise, lifting weights, intervals, moderate training, repeated, any of these things. They all work equally for fat loss because all they're doing is increasing respiration, right? They're saying increased demand for energy, increased acceleration. That's the trick here. And when you equate these things to that, they have equal success in fat loss. It doesn't matter theoretically where you're getting it from. And so when we get into this idea of, well, what are the best training strategies for fat loss? It doesn't matter which one of these tactics you pick, as long as you maintain a consistent adherence over time. Because of this exact fact, it doesn't matter if you're burning quote fat in the exercise session. Or if you're burning carbohydrates in the exercise session, it is totally irrelevant to your net fat loss over time. Now there's some significant misconceptions there about what I just talked and I would love to come back and walk through that in more detail. But that's the main take-home message here. It won't matter what's coming in and it won't matter what's coming out because in either case it is the same rate of oxygen in and CO2 out. That's the key metric. And hopefully this helps a lot of people have some relief because they're like, man, you're so tied up on what is the exact protocol for training for optimizing fat loss? What's the exact nutritional intervention I need for fat loss? And then you wonder why all these different diets can work effectively. And wonder why all these different training protocols, and surely you know somebody who lost a bunch of weight and the only thing they did is they just started running. There was no advanced protocol they just started running and they ran five miles every day. That works. And then tons of people who tried that and liked didn't lose anything. And lots of people who went to I went to Cardio Kitbox in class last way. Oh, I just started doing intervals on my why? Mysteriously you do all these things work. There had you have something had some spidies and it has to be going off in your brain where like there's has to be something linking these things. And what's linking it is simply carbon exchange. So put yourself in a position in which you are exiling more than you and inhaling without passing out. The other problem is if you were to simply do a breathing protocol, while the rate of exhalation would go up after that you would correct and go in the opposite direction. So that's the problem is your net carbon that output over the course of the day is not going to change unless you increase the demand for energy. And that's how you get to that negative state. Along these lines of exhaling carbons as the route for fat loss makes me wonder whether or not increasing lung capacity is possible. I'm guessing the answer is yes. And whether or not increasing lung capacity is a good goal in root to enhancing fat loss. Essentially what I'm asking is if you can offload more CO2, okay, carbon per exhal are you a more efficient fat loss machine. It's a wonderful thought and the answer would be not. Not something to worry about because if you were to exhal more carbon than actually needed, now we're in a state of inefficiency. You're burning way more energy than needed to do your activity. The heart has a metric called cardiac this is in science. We abbreviate this as Q for some odd reasons. It's either CO or Q. And cardiac output is heart rate multiplied by stroke volume. So how many beats for minute you're having as well as how much blood's coming out of it. So cardiac output is actually very specific to energy needs. If you try to work around that it's just going to adjust itself. So what I mean by this is if you were able to increase your stroke volume, see amount of blood coming out per pump, you would automatically adjust to reduce your heart rate so that you keep cardiac output exact to energetic demands. So you're sort of pushing one in this of the spectrum but your body will pull the other one back to keep you at that exact same neutral level. So if you look at if you think about like cardiovascular adaptations to endurance training and any type of endurance training, a common thing people will understand is resting heart rate. And so what that number is is how many beats per minute you're having when you're sitting or doing nothing. A very positive adaptation is a lowering of that resting rate over time. As general numbers what you will hear is people will say things like a normal resting heart rate is between 60 to 80 beats per minute. And you know, if any of the things I've talked about with the individuals I work with, I don't work with anybody with disease. Just to clarify that. I don't do anything with disease, management, treatment, anything. It's always about people who are in a good spot. Who want to optimize or get the next level whether this is professional athletes trying to to peak for physical performance or the folks in our rapid health optimization program that feel good. Again, it's not disease stuff and they want to feel incredible. One of the metrics we're going to pay attention to is this resting heart rate. So what here's what happens as you improve your endurance. Your resting heart rate will go down. If I see somebody over 70 beats per minute, unless something's going on, you're not physically fit. Regardless of whether or not that is quote unquote within the normative values, I want to see everybody's some 60 beats per minute or close. Right. And that does not a difficult thing to really get to for most people. So if you train a lot, regardless of how you train intervals, steady state, doesn't matter, that resting heart rate will come down. But since energy demands at rest, haven't really changed cardiac alpha stays the same. So what happens is stroke volume goes up. So literally, likely, train your quadriceps on the legist end of machine to get stronger. So you can produce more force per contraction. The heart will do the exact same thing. And so as you're able to get more of the blood out of your heart, per pump, the heart realizes I don't need to pump as often. So that's the compensatory adaptation, which is saying, hey, look, I don't need to beat 60 times a minute. I now need to beat 55 times a minute because I'm getting the same amount of blood out per pump chill. And this is why you're resting heart rate goes down. Your resting stroke volume goes up, but your cardiac output is identical. So that's not a good metric of fitness. It's going to stay the same. Cardiac output will only adjust for energetic changes. All right. Energy requirements in a cute moment. How much do I need? Go, which is going to be determined by ventilation. How much air am I bringing in and putting out? That's going to determine cardiac output and that's going to determine where we're at. If you were to do like a sub-maximal exercise test, when you were unfit to when you're fit or when you're fit to where you're super fit, at sub-maximals, you're going to see the same thing. Cardiac output will be identical. And you're like, damn, nothing happened. What you're not realizing is your heart rate at that same workload is now lower. And that's efficiency because your stroke volume is higher. Where it gets people tripped up is that max. Because you may not see a much of a change at max because you don't really see an increase in maximum heart rate with fitness. That's not a thing. Right. So maximum heart rate is not a good proxy for fit or unfit. I'm like that. Stroke volume will get limited eventually by filling capacity of your heart. It has to have so much time to fill up with blood before I can contract again and squeeze the blood out. And when you have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute, that just doesn't leave much time to fill. And so it won't really push you past that. So don't worry about trying to increase your maximum heart rate. That's not necessarily a good thing and it won't really change. But your cardiac output will because stroke volume will be higher. But that doesn't necessarily mean that I should avoid training that gets me up toward maximum heart rate correct. Oh, you should absolutely do it. Right. That's what that was my assumption.

So we've got these different modes of moving energy, but making and breaking energy bonds in the body, moving energy into different tissues and out of different tissues and indeed out of body through exhalation. How do each of these different modes of energy utilization relate to different modes of movement and exercise? In my mind, I'm starting to draw a bridge between when I walk for 60 minutes. If I'm talking, I'm breathing a bit more. Maybe I'm burning a little more fat. After all, speech is a modified exhale. Amazing. If I'm sprinting, breathing differently and if I'm doing a 30 minute moderate, quote unquote moderate jog breathing differently. So you've beautifully illustrate this bridge between energy production and utilization and carbon dioxide offload through exhalation. What are some of the specifics about energy utilization according to different modes of exercise and if we could better define modes of exercise or types of exercise that trigger specific adaptations? I think this is where the bridge will move from being a mirror line to a real structure. Yeah, absolutely. I want to lay one more foundational piece. And then it's going to be much easier to understand the limitations that put on some of these training protocols as well as the lack of limitations. Okay, so it's really, really important. The way I want to start this is we have this foundation now of carbon and basic energy production. That's not to say there is no difference. There is and that difference is important. But maybe we can answer the question from earlier, which is actually something you asked me this morning when we were exercising. You're like training fasted. Right. Just training fasted and hands fast loss. And the logic is sound. If I don't have any fuel, then I should be burning more fat. Therefore, I shouldn't be losing more fat. It's sound. It's not true. It's a great idea. It's one of these classic things in science and exercise. Physiology where you're like sounds good. Turns out it's not. It's actually a pretty gross misunderstanding of metabolism. So it's not to pick on that topic. I don't really care about that topic. But it is a, it's a common question. It also gives me an opportunity to just tell you more about metabolism. So here's what happens. You're breathing in O2 and breathing OCO2. However, the ratio to that is what we call either RER, respiratory exchange ratio or RQ, respiratory quotient. And I'm not going to differentiate those two. They're not the same thing. But we're going to skip past that for now. As you begin to increase exercise intensity, the percentage of O2 to CO2 rises in the favor of CO2. So you start breathing out way more CO2 than you are breathing in O2. And so if we were to look at that number, what's the relationship echoes up? So at rest, most people have a value that we would typically call something like 0.6. And that's again the relationship between O2 and CO2. Maybe 0.7. If you were to go for a walk that increases slightly because you're now expiring CO2 at a higher rate. So now you've moved up to say 0.8 or something like that. One of the ways that we mark somebody of achieving an actual VO2 max on a test is if that value exceeds 1.1. Now any of you who are paying attention are thinking wait a minute, how the hell can a ratio between two things ever get past one? Well that's because you're getting into a place where you're actually offloading more CO2 than is actually necessary. And this is what actually causes and explains a thing that people like to call E-POC, which is excess exercise post-oxygen consumption. This is another way to think about it. The only reason you're breathing is to bring in oxygen when offload CO2. If I'm no longer exercising, why am I still breathing? In other words, once you stop the demand or the need for energy, you should stop ventilating. But you don't. Right? That's because in the case of low intensity exercise, the second you stop, you're right back down the rest being ventilation. No problem, because you were able to match the need for energy with the offload of waste, one to one during that exercise. When you start creeping up the intensity, you can't do that. So you have to basically start stealing a little bit of fuel here. So even though you're done exercising, you're still ventilating because you have to pay that back and pay that back by that I specifically mean you have to bring in oxygen because you have a whole bunch of waste that's been accumulating in your tissue that you've got to deal with. And I'll walk you through what that waste is. It's a particular molecule that a lot of people have heard of, but grossly misunderstood. So you got to be able to handle that. So the reason that you sit there and go and continue to ventilate is because you're now trying to pay back that excess post exercise oxygen debt. That's that oxygen debt we're specifically talking about. All right. So that being said, as we start cruising up that our cue starts going up, up, up, up, up, up, up and if we get the one, your 1.0 you're you're in like you're hurting. You're in a pretty good spot. All right. All right. You're hurting. You're in a pretty good spot. He has a window into Dr. Andy Gallop in his mind. Now you really want to be a subject in his laboratory study. Sure. Massicists warm to Andy's lab. Absolutely. All right. So the idea that I will lose more fat by being in an exercise situation that is burning more fat. It seems to make sense, but it's a massive failure to understand the metabolism. It's the exact same explanation to like exercising fasted doesn't matter. So the exercising fasted issue on a normal circumstance is irrelevant because you have plenty of fuel in the system even when you have an eight and breakfast that morning. Now if you're talking like extended fasting or multiple days, this is a different scenario. If muscle glycogen, liver glycogen and blood glucose are at sufficient levels, then you absolutely have enough energy to perform almost any type of exercise that most people are doing. You know, maybe if you're robbed and you're at mile 20 today, it's a different story, but the vast majority of us have plenty of fuel sitting around. So we're not going to burn more into fat just because we didn't eat breakfast that morning. So that's just doesn't make energetic sense. We have a lot of backup supplies in your never-out. The trick here is this, there's a concept here we call crossover concept. So as we are starting to move up exercise intensity, we start burning a higher percentage of our fuel from carbohydrates and a lower percentage of our fuel coming from fat. I'm sleeping. That's the highest percentage of your fuel that will be coming from fat of any activity you could ever do. So if the theory that I'm going to stay at a lower intensity to burn more fat was true, the optimal fat burning strategy would then be to sleep. Like that doesn't make sense. Of course it doesn't. So why would then going at a slightly elevated rate somehow all of a sudden magically make you lose fat? It doesn't actually make sense. When you think about that we were like, oh yeah there's no way. So it's a percentage trick. It's a difference between absolute and relative. This is what this confusion is. So yes, as you start doing the lower intensity to exercise whether you're faster than not it's irrelevant. But lower intensity to exercise a greater percentage of your fuel is coming from fat. However, your total fuel expenditure is very low. So that whole total carbon balance is not really being shifted much. As you start exercising in a very high intensity you actually start getting a higher percentage of your fuel from carbohydrates and a lower percentage from fat. In fact at rest about the highest you can get in most people is about 60% of your fuel from fat. As you're sleeping you might be 70% but you'll never be in a position ever no matter what sort of thing you've heard in the internet. You'll never be in a situation where fat is your only fuel source. The highest I've probably ever seen is like 70%. You should probably be at about that's a kind of a good number to think honestly. But people will understand a little bit of a metabolism to be dangerous but not enough. We'll throw out these terms like fat adapted. And fat adapted is a real thing but is a massive misunderstanding oftentimes. It is this idea thinking like I can get into a spot where I'm maximizing fat burning. Maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise and maximizing fat loss over time are not the same thing at all. That's the confusion. So if you enhance fat oxidation and exercise that does not enhance fat loss per se. So this is the lot of the confusion that's happening. As we start moving up we can never get in a position where we're using fat only as a fuel. Again, at best you're at 70% fat. 30% carbohydrate. For a lot of reasons we probably don't have time to get into today. However the opposite is possible. When you get into true high intensity exercise you'll be basically 100% carbohydrate in 0% fat. That is very possible. That in fact is 1.0. That's what I'm talking about. 1.1 is actually because your ventilation got so high you actually exceeded that number even though you're at 100% carbohydrate. This is what people came up with the idea then it's like, well I don't want to burn carbs. I want to lose fat. So my response to that is always like, okay great. So it makes sense burning fat, losing fat, burning carbs, losing what then. Like you think you're liver shrunk? Like the glutton. What did you lose that? Where did it come from? It's all coming as carbon. Don't worry about where it came from for your fuel. It just has to come out as carbon. There are differences in exercise efficiency for performance with our professional athletes of course. But if the only goal here is fat loss, it doesn't matter where you get it from. The last bridge we have to connect here is like, wait a minute, if I only burned carbohydrate. How did I actually lose that fat? There was that, there was that glove handle sitting on the side of me. How did that come out of me? If I never burned that from my fuel? What you're failing to understand is there's a balance scheme that happens here. So if you were to do a bunch of high intensity exercise training and you burned only muscle glycogen and blood glucose and maybe even you did it for so long. You burned some liver glycogen. The body understands that it has expelled a lot of energy from that side of the equation. It's going to do a couple of things. Now it's very difficult to go through this fancy situation where you convert carbohydrates into fat and back before. That's actually fairly hard. What's easier to do is something you said earlier is actually just bias energetics to a different fuel source. So in that scenario where you're down really low in your carbohydrate storage. Any carbohydrates you bring in are going to go to storage. And since your net energy expenditure is something that your body regulates a lot, any fat that you then bring in is going to be utilized as a fuel source because it knows it doesn't need it anymore. That is an excess. So that's how you actually use fat as a fuel because you've burned down carbohydrate storage. As I'm hearing this, a couple of things come to mind. First of all, thank you for that incredibly important description of what is otherwise a very confusing landscape for most people. One of the key points I took away and I just want to say from the outset, this is not exhaustive by any stretch, is that burning fat does not equal losing fat from the body. Correct. And then burning fat has to be divided into burning of body fat stores and we need to distinguish that from burning of dietary fat that is brought in. Often times people don't disambiguate those. Correct. And I've also understanding that reducing one's body carbohydrates stores, muscle glycogen, liver glycogen, etc. occurs during high intensity exercise. Who else other ways? But that is one very efficient way to tap into those stores, which makes me wonder. And this is one of these things that does it lead to a protocol, makes me wonder whether or not doing high intensity, let's say weight training for 45 to 60 minutes, 75 minutes of strength training power training, hyperature of retraining, which we've covered in an episode about those topics. And then doing some steady state cardiovascular exercise, is there any benefit to that arrangement that would quote unquote enhance body fat loss from the body, if we were very specific now, because unlike the idea that training fasted would shift the bias towards fat loss, which it doesn't, you've told us. Under those conditions, muscle glycogen and maybe even liver glycogen is going to be depleted. Put simply, can I enhance body fat loss by doing some cardio after about of weight training? If you equate for total energy expenditure, it won't matter. Now, you did bring up a very important point that I want to clarify. If you look at the exercise modalities that we laid out in our previous conversations, we talked about nine different adaptations. One was skill and then speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic capacity, aerobic capacity, and long duration endurance. Now speed, power, and skill development have almost no benefit for foul loss. Because remember, those are low weight, a lot of rest and low volume. They're not really going to be helpful. You can make a little bit of a case for strength, a little bit, but the total energy expenditure for strength training, even if it's an hour, if it's truly strength training, it's fairly low. Because the repetitions are in the one to three range. That's exact. It's not a total work. So if you're trying to develop a protocol, that sort of optimizes fat loss, what you want to do, you're close. And my opinion is to a combination of something in the hypertrophy slash muscular endurance strength training realm. Okay. So six to 30 repetitions. Something like that. A resistance training. Great. Deplete muscle glycogen, maybe even a bit of liver glycogen. Maybe a little bit depending on if you're doing it for a long time, but probably not a noticeable amount. Okay. So an hour of hypertrophy type training. If you're training hard with low rest and you really did an hour, you would for sure get there. But most people don't. Because the reason why I crave large bowls of oatmeal and rice after I do weight training, you want to replenish muscle glycogen. Totally. Right. Then you may be do a little bit of very high intensity. Maxim heart rate well overvealed to max. A heart as you can for 20, 30, 40, five, 60 seconds. Something like that with some recovery. A lot of recovery and repeated. And that's going to do a great job of replenishing muscle glycogen. Right. If you do that long enough, you'll get the liver. But again, most people don't because it's really, really hard to go that hard. So liver is your last last resort. Yeah. Basic mechanics here, which will actually get into as our third segment here is energy production comes from the local exercising muscle first and foremost from phosphocreatin and carbohydrate stores. Right. And so again, in we store it, a muscle we call it glycogen. Right. That's your first sign of light on defense. If you need glucose outside of that, you're going to start pulling it from the blood. But one of the things, your body regulates a handful of things over almost everything. Blood pH, blood glucose, blood and electrolyte concentrations. It really does not want to mess with those things at all. It will change almost anything else in the body to keep those things standardized. Right. You generally because you need all those things for your brain to work and your brain will stop working. If you lose blood pressure and will go up there, pH changes, you can't run metabolism, electrolytes change, you can't think. And glucose is a primary fuel source for the brain. It's going to be a problem. Right. So if that number starts to come down because you're grabbing glucose out of the blood, your liver is going to then kick in. It's going to break down. It's glycogen to put glucose in the blood to keep the blood number the level. In fact, one of the things you'll see is blood glucose concentrations rise during exercise. They don't fall. In fact, they rise as an anticipory state. If you train a lot, your blood glucose will start going up before you start moving. It knows it's coming. So you can play that game. You can rob Peter to pay Paul for a long time and tell your liver runs out. And that's what actually is a bunk. In terms of long duration and during stuff, you're talking many, many, many miles several hours. Typically, we say, oh, it's got to be over two hours. Before your liver starts to become a real problem or it has to be tremendously intense. Because of those reasons, you have to burn through just a lot of energy before your liver starts to get into a problem. You can continue to train when your muscle glycogen levels are low. In fact, people say glycogen to a glycogen to a muscle, but it's generally misnomer. And you are going to have tremendous signals of fatigue when that number gets lower than 75%. So people think that like their muscles are getting heavy, you're probably still 75% full. A lot of folks will quit around the 50%. The highest I've ever seen is like 95% true depletion. And that's an extremely high level cross country skiers and like their deltoid. It's very, very low. Some very talented runners will get fairly low in their quads. But the vast majority of folks, by the time you're 50% depleted, you're going to quit. It's going to be really, really challenging. So you're never really going to get that low. It's like a bit of a protective mechanism. But when your liver gets low, you're going to be shut down. And that's the case with if you're ever going to like a marathon and you've seen people run like 25 and a half miles. And then they just like bump. They go into like baby dears walking, stance and then they collapse. And you're like, how are you mentally weak? Like you ran 26 miles and you can't run the last point in any mentally weak. It is if your liver is done, it's going to stop you because there's no more backup reserves. Muscle, you can get away with, you can push through it. The liver will not let you go any farther. I find this fascinating because it makes me wonder whether or not the liver being depleted sends a neural signal to the brain. Or the brain must register some signal. Like I would like to be alive tomorrow. Thank you. Whatever it's happening right now, stopping is going to be safer than continuing. And so that stop signal is one that I think a lot of people, including myself, are intrigued by because we always think that it's related to willpower. But the brain needs to preserve itself. And as the master computer, I mean, there are ways to go into kind of a Tomaton type, not thinking just doing type behavior. You have all the right switches, right? And you can play those cards. And you can get better at learning and being less sensitive to that switch. That's exactly what happened you first start training. You start to realize like, oh my gosh, I'm super tired. And then you realize really quick, like, oh, I'm totally fine here. And this is like the pick pick your person who's made things like this. But it's like you really only 10% depleted or 30% or 40% or some were all operating 40% of me could do. Of course, any of those things are true because it is like a little bit of an override. You've just gotten very sensitive to being a small percentage to depleted. And you've learned, okay, I'm tired. And there is a long way to go past that. But once you get past that and you flip that override switch a lot, you just you're going to break quickly. Because you basically learn to ignore that signal and problems can happen really quickly after that. And that's even experienced endurance athletes. If you hit that level, it's like you're going to be hitting the concrete next. And that's, you know, potentially a problem. I want to make sure I understand a concept that you referred to earlier correctly because I have a feeling that I don't. And that's this issue of how the body accesses body fat stores when in a sub-collaric state. And I'm doing mainly glycogen burning exercise. What I heard you say and please correct me where I'm undoubtedly wrong. What I heard you say was that, okay, I go into the gym and I start lifting weights. I'm burning muscle glycogen. Mostly local to the muscles that I'm using. And then I start pulling glycogen from the bloodstream. Maybe there's some body fat stores that are mobilized, probably not dipping into my liver glycogen. Okay, I complete the workout. Maybe I even hop on the air dine bike and do a little sprint. Yeah, go for a jog. Maybe immediately afterward. Maybe I don't eat for a few hours afterwards. But across the day, I ingest fewer calories than I burn. Is it the case that body fat is mobilized in order to replace the glycogen that my sub-collaric intake was insufficient to provide. In other words, because I didn't eat enough to fill the glycogen stores. Am I using body fat, converted into glycogen to fill those stores? Right. And if so, is that a case where I'm no longer ex-handling carbons in order to burn body fat, but rather I'm repurposing body fat into muscle. Have I turned fat into muscle in that case? Yeah, I'm really glad you asked this because I did a very poor job on that last point talking about earlier. I'm realizing playing back on my head because that's so many really good questions. You cannot turn fat into muscle. Can you turn muscle into fat? No. I'm so glad you said that because when I was in college, yeah, our, I don't want to out that person. The physiology teacher seemed to think still at that point that one could lift weights get muscular, but then it would eventually turn into body fat. That myth as I think largely been dispelled. I heard that so many times as a kid, I heard it so many times in college, I heard it so I heard so many times in our undergraduate students from other faculty and such. So no, they're not the same structures. They are very different. Let me take a shot and answer this better. You were really, really, really close. So yeah, if you were to do that type of exercise where you've burned a lot of muscle glycogen, how is it? I'm losing stored fat. That's really the clock's the question. And it doesn't even actually matter if you then went ahead and ingested carbohydrates or fat post-sexual size. That's not really thing. You've had a couple of key things. Number one, this is all under the assumption that total caloric intake is still low. You have total need. I also want to flag calories in, calories out is not the only thing that matters. This is a very complex thing. Calories in is incredibly complicated. Calories out is even more complicated. So we just, well, maybe another series we can spend on that alone. So don't don't go nuts about that. You have to be hypocloric one where the other. If you burn a much of muscle glycogen and you are hypercoric, you're still going to add fat. If you burn a much of muscle glycogen and you're hypocloric, you're going to lose fat. Think about it this way. You're in a negative calorie state. Where are those calories going to come from? Are you going to reduce your muscle glycogen storage is permanently? No. No. Are you going to reduce your glycogen storage in your liver? No. You want to reduce blood glucose? No. No way, right? So where is that extra energy coming from? It's coming from your storage fat. It is your backup, reserve, energy system. The way that I want to flag this here is people tend to think about it as like carbohydrates versus fat. It's more like a chain, more like a bicycle where there's a front gear and a back gear. You turn one gear and it turns the other one. These are complementary systems. They are not and or systems, right? You're turning one and when we go through carbohydrate metabolism, maybe here in a second, you'll understand why you have to have an anaerobic and a rubble component to that. There is absolutely no way to complete carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen. That has to happen. The only way to engage in fat metabolism is aerobic in oxygen. There's no anaerobic component to it. There's a fundamental difference there. So your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible. It is a primary fuel source for a reason. Your fat is not meant to be flexible. It is meant to be unlimited. That's the basic point. So you want flexibility over here and an unlimited capacity over there. Now I'm safe-carded against any energetic need. I need to run up a hill for safety. Cool. carbohydrates are there. I need to run for 17 hours. Cool. Fat is there. We want both of these systems. You want to be able to have great energy throughout the day. You want a slow drip coming from fat. You don't want up and down, up and down. You'll great, up and down. Awesome. You want to be able to think very quickly and get hyper focused boom carbohydrates ramp right up. Get it into the brain, get thinking better. We want all these. Not just for exercise purposes, but for activities of daily living. We want to optimal system here. When people use the terms like fat adapted, they're generally hijacking that. It used to be a thing. We said all the time and all of my undergraduate classes for years. That idea of metabolic flexibility is using optimal fuel sources and optimal types, not maximizing fat usage. People have co-opted that term. Metabolic flexibility to be like, oh, yeah, yeah, therefore learn how to maximize fat burning. That's not what that term means. That term means maximizing your ability to use whatever fuel is optimal in that time. Now I'll grant you most people aren't fantastic at using fat as a fuel source relative to the other direction, but nonetheless, the gold standard here should be maximizing both. Finally answering your question. If I were to burn a bunch of muscle glycogen, how am I losing that fat? Well, the fuel you're ingesting in that hyper-chloric state is going to say, hey, look, we have a lot of muscle glycogen we have to replenish. So any carbohydrate that comes in needs to be biased towards storage. It's got to go into those tissue. Any fat that comes in or doesn't even come in, but any fat that we're using for fuel needs to be utilized for activity. And that's where the caloric expenditure from fat comes in. So you're basically saying your general physiology, the energy for that starts coming from fat and the energy that's coming in from carbohydrate needs to be simply stored. And so you see as your respiratory quotient changes, right? The RER is going is going off. And so in the exercise moment, it's shot way up for carbohydrates and shot way down for fat. As the compensatory response, it goes the other direction. Because your body's saying, we are low on carbohydrates. Don't use them for fuel unless we absolutely have to, right? So use them for storage. Get our fuel from the fat side of the equation. And so what you're generally going to say is like, oh, I'm burning more fat just sitting around after things like that. And that's not even taking into the equation, the epoch part, which is like it's not actually as large as people think it is. It's fairly small. But it is, it adds up sort of over time. So does that explain a little bit better about how you lose fat when you actually only burn carbs for exercise? You explained it beautifully. You talked about epoch, the post exercise, oxygen consumption, not being that significant in terms of energy utilization. Even though today we're talking about endurance and different forms of endurance, I do have to ask whether or not people consider the elevation in basal metabolism that occurs when there's more muscle around. Yeah. Because muscle is such a metabolicly demanding tissue. Is there a straightforward ish equation? If one adds one pound of lean muscle tissue to their body, even if it's distributed multiple muscle groups, does that equate to a caloric need of X number of calories per day? Yep. And is that because of the muscle protein synthesis needs of that muscle or it's glycogen storage needs or both? If you don't have enough muscle, you start to have problems with fat loss. It's it's difficult challenge. If you have enough muscle and you're just trying to get extremely large, if you fear FFMIs 24 and you're 15% body fat, adding more muscles, not really going to play a lot in the equation and here's why. Muscle is more metabolically active at rest than fat, but fat is not an urge. So fat is still going to burn a small number of calories. Muscle burns more, but it's not nearly what people think it is. I'm a muscle guy. I'm a muscle physiologist. I would love to get people to have more muscle per any excuse I can. It's not honest to say that, though. You're talking about when I was in undergraduate, we would say numbers like 50 kcal per day per pound is what you can look at. So if you put on a pound of muscle spread across the body, your base of metabolic rate would go up by around 50 calories per day. I think that numbers grossly exaggerated. It's probably a tenth of that. 6 to 10 calories. Maybe it's hard to know exactly what that number is, but the more recent estimates are something like that. So now on one hand, you could say, oh my gosh, that is not even meaningful. The other hand, you could say that's super it just depends on time domain you want to put that out. So if you were to put on five pounds of muscle and your basal metabolic rate went up 30 or 40 calories a day, well over the course of a thousand days, that actually adds up. So you could slice as any way you want. Now maybe that number somewhere between, I don't really know it's not a field I paid that much attention to candidly because it's not a metric kind of like epoch where it's like we used to really harp on it and now it's sort of like, well, maybe we exaggerated that like, honestly, just a bit, but to me, it doesn't change the equation much because if you don't have enough muscle, as I described, there are other consequences that are going to make fat loss hard. And so you need to have sufficient muscle. If the additional caloric expenditure is the carrot, great, if it's something else, I don't really care. There's just enough evidence that you need to have it, or I should say, there's enough evidence that it will really help you in your path. Maybe a few calories here there is not really that thing. Especially if you understand a normal food item, anything you pick is going to be probably a couple of hundred calories. One bad food choice a day, well, outkick almost any amount of coverage you got on an adding muscle mass to you. So like you're really stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime. If you're worried about how many calories you're getting from adding muscle, fat loss is going to be about regulating that carbon intake above and beyond anything else. I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker. Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your media and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, etc. But you don't know what to do with that information. Inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course, but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can visit inside tracker.com slash huberman to get 20% off any of inside tracker's plans. Again, that's inside tracker.com slash huberman to get 20% off. So I've heard about this concept of metabolic flexibility mentioned a few times. Frankly, you're the first person who's ever explained it to me in a clear and concise way. How do I know if I am metabolic glee flexible and how do I increase my metabolic flexibility? Sure, there's no specific standard, which is actually a good thing. So if you have a level of specificity that you want or need metabolic glee, then you don't actually want to be in this middle ground. It would be if you are performing in a type of exercise or an athlete who performs any sport that is likely to likely dominated. You don't want to be optimally metabolic glee flexible. You don't want to be super equal to fat adapted. You want to be biased towards energy you're going to use. The same could be true for the other end of spectrum. So in those particular cases, it's not optimal to be equally effective because there are no free passes in physiology. Energy producing systems will upregulate or downregulate accordingly. So you will actually limit your ability to say maximally utilized carbohydrates a few. If you're trying to upregulate your ability to use fat as a fuel. So there's a saturation point outside of that spectrum. Most people would say, hey, I want to feel great throughout the day to be able to do a bunch of different things. How do you know? A couple of things. There's a lot of biological markers you can take. There's also just some practical takes. None of these markers by themselves are any sign. What you want to do is probably a couple of them and then say, okay, this is maybe a clue. So again, it's really important to emphasize not a single one of these tests that I'm about to walk you through. Automatically means you can't use fat as a fuel or the other case, which is maybe your poor using carbohydrates as a fuel. So this claimers aside, we'll get into a couple of them. So should we think about these as informative and useful, but not diagnostic? Exactly. We would call this data inspired or data lead and not data driven. Right. Okay, cool. So number one, you want to think about just overall functionality. Do you have a reasonable regulation of your energy throughout the day? Now, many things could be going into this, which is why these are not specific diagnostics. But as a basic measure, we talked about blood glucose levels. You know, a lot of people will say, again, you want that to be something like between 80 and 90 milligrams per deciliter is a blood glucose level. And you can go look at the cutoff points for what determines to be pre-diabetic and type 2 diabetic, et cetera. What I can actually recommend, this is, there's a little bit of science here actually, then I'll talk you through. But a lot of this is my personal preference. I generally want people to be at 85 or lower. And that's because of a couple of things. Number one, there's actually some papers that showed every single point increase above 85. Increases your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes by about 6%. Okay, great. So technically, while maybe you're 95, we're even up to 100 or, you know, in the quote unquote, normative values, that's one clue. Again, it's not definitive by itself. It doesn't mean anything. You need to really pay attention to what increasing by 6% actually means. But it's a data point where I'm looking at. If I actually then see symptomology, and we run you through maybe some questionnaires ask how you're feeling throughout the day and we see uncontrolled energy about. So you're a lot of energy, then you get really, really tired and swings. Okay, another data point. All right. And we may patch a few of these things together. That may give me some clues. That being said, again, this a lot of this rhetoric is used to then scare people off of carbohydrates. And that is, I want to be as clear as possible. That is not truly the only thing people should care about. Right? It can be a thing. I can also be unrelated. There are reasons you could have blood glucose concentrations at this level or energy swings that are unrelated to carbohydrate and just in at all. All right. So one test you can either run in addition to that. If you're going to get blood glucose measured, you can look at some markers we talked about earlier about your AST and ALT. We talked about how you can kind of look at that AST ALT ratio before. You can actually do the inverse, which is look at ALT and AST. The kind of normative value there, you're going to look at is like 0.8. I actually like to see it lower than that. And that alone has been actually associated with blood glucose dysregulation. And so if you see multiple designs again, we're looking for patterns and patterns and patterns in both in our case, on biomarkers, symptomology and performance. And now you're, if all three of those things are lining up, you may have an issue. So performance wise, a couple of little tests you can run. Ideally, you have some sort of standard work out you do. And hopefully it's it's pretty objective. So in other words, like, I run the same 15 minute loop every morning for my cardio. Oh, okay, great. How long does it take you to run that loop? Like you could pick whatever distance. It doesn't really matter. What's your heart rate during that thing? And then what's your perceived exertion? Now, you should be able to do that fasted with very little drop in performance. If you can do that, then that tells me you're fairly good at using a fattest view source. If, however, the one day you go to do your standard workout and you feel awful fasting, that may be another clue that perhaps you're not very good at dialing in that system. If you recover afterwords, in terms of heart rate recovery, is very long. It may be another clue that you have a poor utilization fattest view source. The inverse can also be true. So if I give you something in the neighborhood of like 50 or so grams of carbohydrate and 30 minutes later, your face is falling off the table, that's a good sign that you're in the opposite. You're actually very, very, very poor utilizing carbohydrate as a fuel. And the reason I bring that up is that is equally a problem. We send, we hear people a lot, make comments like, man, I have to say away from carbs, I crash really hard that has what that actually means is you're very poor at utilizing carbohydrates as fuel. You're getting your sensitivity as way off. We should be able to have carbohydrate at a reasonable dosage 50 grams and not fall asleep 30 minutes later or have to run to caffeine. So that is a sign in our opinion. This is again now just my practical brain telling you is that's a sign of dysfunction. We should be able to have plenty of carbohydrates through the day if we choose to, if we want to for any reason. Now of course, if you were to throw 150 or 200 grams of carbohydrate in your belly, you're probably going to take a little bit of an energy hit after that, but we should be able to have a reasonable dosage and not have to fall asleep afterwards. What is one way that people can enhance their utilization of carbohydrates for exercise? The reason I ask is I think I fall into that category. I do consume some complex carbohydrates and fruit post resistance training and that tends to be one of hungriest for them, but typically, unless I've just done some resistance training, I keep most of my daytime meals relatively low carbohydrate and then in the evening, I prefer slightly less protein and more carbohydrate because it has this effect of sedating me a little bit and I sleep well. I know this runs against whatever one was taught, which is to not eat carbohydrates live the day, but I like it because then I tend to wake up in the morning with at least as far as I can tell. My glycogen stores not necessarily topped off, but certainly filled. I'm able to train fasted in the morning and my favorite pre-workout is a consists of water and caffeine and electrolytes. Maybe some supplementated concentration as well, but I love training fasted. There's actually a number of things. One little sticky thing you threw in there is actually the use of caffeine. That's another sign if you have to have caffeine to do your fasted training. That's generally another sign you're not very good at using the fuel. I use caffeine prior to resistance training workouts. Generally, I don't need it for any kind of cardiovascular training. I want to say that, it doesn't mean it's bad. It's just like another clue this like, okay, you should be able to do this without having to have caffeine to execute it. Now, using caffeine to get a better result is sort of different as an urgienic aid. We actually use a lot of high carbohydrate meals at the end of the day, a lot of the times for our athletes who are cutting weight or trying to reduce weight. So it is a fantastic way to handle a lot of things. That idea that if you eat carbs late at night, that'll increase fasted. That's all is so old and so well destroyed. That's not a concern. There's so much data showing. In fact, there's so much data on like, deeting timing is generally poorly understood about when you can eat and what you can eat in the morning, versus eating at night. A lot of what we heard there is stopping. Maybe we just saved that for another day because we're going to get really far down. That's what we can. Yeah, but yeah. So I think our plan is to cover that in an episode on nutrition. Okay, good. Which is in this series. The only thing that I would add to it is, you know, what you hear about ingesting carbohydrate late at night, I should just say that at least in my case, I'm eating the majority of my carbohydrate unless I trained resistance trained early in the day, in which case I post resistance training in the last meal of the day. But for me, that's not really late at night. That last meal is somewhere between 630 and 730 p.m. Just three or so hours or something like that before you sleep around 1030 or so. Yeah. So it's not, you know, midnight bowls of pasta. I'm done that too. But typically it's not. So I think that people will be very interested myself included in how meal timing relates to all of this. But yeah, let's tell you how do you prove fat utilization, how do you prove carb hydrogenization? Let's hammer both out really quickly. And henceing fat utilization is as simple as doing a little bit of work in a either pre-fat ingested state. So anytime you ingest a nutrient prior to training, you're going to bias towards that nutrient, right? Which is almost what we were talking about earlier. So if you want to guarantee you burn more fat, eat more fat prior to work out. Now you're not going to lose fat. But what you're what you're effectively signaling is we have an over-abundance of this fuel, preferentially target this fuel. Now the downside is that may actually hinder your performance. That's typically only a concern for people at a very high level. Fatt is a slower fuel source. So if you're relying a borrup on that, your top end is going to come down a little bit. And so you wouldn't want to do that strategy prior to race if it is a carbohydrate dependent race. I mean, in fact, we actually see long-term adaptations that would suggest that. So the enzymes are responsible for carbohydrate metabolism will down regulate. And so you get worse at that. So not a great strategy there. Um, carbohydrate be the opposite, right? So if you have carbohydrate prior to exercise, you're going to bias more towards that. So a handful of things you can do if your total caloric intake is simply managed, that's going to take care a lot of these problems. And appropriate eating strategy. So the types of food, the combinations of food, all those things are going to make your post carbohydrate and just in bulk. A lot of the things can go away. So there's a little bit of physiology that has to be corrected for. So he's a little bit in one hand, you can go very deep here. Right? So the real answer of how we would do this is if we see scenario like that, we're going to do a whole set of analyses. We're going to go full labs, right? Probably extensive blood panel urine saliva, stool even. And we're going to figure out where is that glucose dysregulation coming from? So a lot of people think like, oh, it's a metabolism issue. It might be. And also might just be a flag that something else is happening in the body. So we're going to actually work backwards a lot to try to figure out exactly why that's occurring. It may be as simple as, oh, you're eating a lot of your carbohydrates without any fiber or protein. And we know that that's important because those will actually blunt the glycemic index, like the rise and blood glucose. So it could be a simple thing of this like, oh, your combination of food is doing it. It's not the total amount. It may be something again, more endogenous to the actual system. It could be a rate issue. It could be a breathing issue. There could be a number of things. So the way to get better at it is to simply train it. And specificity is king here. So if you want to get better at managing your blood glucose throughout the day, so they're not feeling those things, it could be a field issue. But it could be a number of other things. And it's just hard to go into all of them with within our time constraint. So the practical tool that I would say here is if you want to get better at managing energy throughout the day, make sure that number one, your protein is stabilized. Make sure number two, you're ingesting your food in the right combinations ideally with some fiber and or some protein or both. That alone will help stabilize a lot of the problems. Then you need to train at high intensity. You want to get better at using carbohydrates in the fuel, train at a higher intensity and have carbohydrates right before the workout. We'll do that a lot if if we see folks who are, I kind of walked you through the test of identifying if you're not very good at using fat as a fuel. The test for not being good at using carbohydrates is a fuel as both at eating, test I talked about, as well as performance. If you're a very, very, very slow starter, it's just like a really hard to get going, that generally indicates you might mean a situation where you're not very good at using carbohydrates. It's fuel. So we're going to practice that. We're going to have a pre carbohydrate pre exercise carbohydrates right now. Then we're going to do higher intensity stuff. Not the point of making you sick and digestive issues all that stuff. But we want to get better at using carbohydrates as a fuel faster. If you want to get better doing the opposite, then you do that opposite starter. Either again using fat prior to the workout knowing your peak performance is going to go down a little bit, but you're investing in adaptation. Right. So it's not about that workout. It's about what's going to happen. Six, eight, ten weeks from now. Investments are going to think about it. Or you could bring in some fasted training. And so I want to really make sure I clarify when we were talking about earlier. I'm not at all against fasted training. It's not it works. It's just isn't required for fat loss. It isn't required for fat adaptation. It is a great option of if you want. What I was hoping to do with that conversation and maybe I didn't articulate that well is to not restrict people, but it's to open you up. And at least you have a lot of options. If you like to do fasted cardio, amazing. It is great. If you hate it, you don't have to. You can reach the same performance goals, the same physique goals, without ever doing it. If you love long duration study state stuff, it is great. If you hate it, there are other options, higher intensity stuff. Again, if we're just talking about fat loss. So I hope now that that's a little clearer in terms of the same thing in the nutrition. If you like higher carb, great. If you like lower carb, these are all great. You have options. And you don't have to fret so much over, oh my gosh, I have to do this thing in a certain way. And I absolutely hate it. You don't have to worry about it. Hit those concepts. And you'll be fine. A few minutes ago, you mentioned that if we ingested given macronutrient, fat, then the body will preferentially use that fuel source. If you ingest carbohydrate, we'll use that fuel source. Is it always the case that the body uses the ingested macronutrient prior to using glycogen? I have to imagine using both. I mean, if I were to have some carbohydrate before doing any kind of training, the muscle still burn glycogen, right? Or do they have some way to register the amount of circulating carbohydrate that would allow or available carbohydrate in the form of foodstuffs that would allow them to not tap into their own muscle fibers stores of glycogen? Right. So the way we derive energy for exercise or basic maintenance, a little bit about cellular physiology. So you've got a couple of organelles and structures that we need to pay attention to. The first one is the nucleus. That's hold you DNA. The second one is the mitochondria. And then everything outside that you've got all these other organelles that do a bunch of things like ribosomes, or protein synthesis, et cetera, et cetera. All right. Now, when you want to produce energy for exercise, anytime you hear the word anaerobic, you automatically understand we are meaning without oxygen. All right. Great. That all happens in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is that space that is not the mitochondria, not the nucleus. So it's the space in between everything else. This is like jelly-like substance that sounds there. So anaerobic metabolism happens there. Every single a-robic metabolic process happens in the mitochondria. All right. Why is that important? If I go to create cellular energy and I need it the fastest possible. I'm going to go for a fastful creatine because it is stored directly in the cytoplasm. The stoichiometry is one to one there, which means for every mole of a fastful creatine I burn, I can create one ATP. It's one to one. It is incredibly fast, but it is very limited because think about it. How much of that could I possibly store in the small size of the cell? That's it. If I need energy past that point, now I'll start using muscle glycogen. Because that is also stored in the cytoplasm. So it is right there. The stoichiometry is not one to one. It's a little bit higher, probably like four, to one. So for every molecule of glycogen, you burn your going to get something like four, yeah, like some small number of ATP out of that, which is great. But again, you're running into a storage problem. How much can I possibly store inside a muscle cell? It is very, very fast, much more effective than phosphor creatine, but so there. If I then want to metabolize any form of fat, or if I want to complete the metabolization of carbohydrates, I have to start transferring into the mitochondria. Now, I start getting whole hosts of ATP. If you were to fully run through this thing, which I'll talk about a second, called the TCA cycle, or Krebs cycle, you'll get now something like 28 or 30 or 35, down a depending, ATP per. So the energetic output is much higher. Okay, so here's exactly what happens. Then I'm going to walk you through this in the form of carbohydrate, and then I'll come backwards and go through fat. So remember, carbohydrate, it is one carbon molecule that has been hydrated. So it is one to one. So the actual chemistry here, it is C, H2O, one carbon, two, eight, one, oh. Glucose is a six carbon chain. So the chemistry here is C6, H12, 06. Six carbon, six waters. Very simple. That's a carbohydrate. All right, so you can imagine, if you're watching on the video here, you'll see my fingers going, now it's all tried. I make sure I explain it to you all just listening in the easy fashion. So you've got this chain of six carbons as in front of you. And the very first step of metabolism is you snap that thing in half. Right, so you break into two separate three carbon chains. All right. Now, in doing that, you got a little bit of energy because you broke that one bond, but not a tremendous amount. This is called glycolysis. So lysis being the split, and you know, glyc, being like you split, like a gin up. Got a little bit of energy of that. All right, you formed this three-colored carbon chain called pyruvate or pyruvic acid. Okay, there's differences there, but don't don't kill me. General audience friends. All right. I got to, I got to give this to everybody. So you got a little bit of that. Now you can't do much past that besides rip one more carbon off of each of those three carbon chains. So I've got two three carbon chains. I'd have be careful how I do this with my fingers. So I don't flip you off here in a second. But I burn one more off of each. I get a little bit of energy. And now that little two carbon chain, I have two two two two carbon chains. Those are called acid till co-A. All right. Amazing. I have now completed an aerobic glycolysis. I've got really nothing left. I can do here. I made a little bit of ATP. Now wait a minute. I have now freed two carbon. Because, remember, I started with six. I split them apart, but I didn't two three carbon chains. I burned one each. I've got two free-froating carbon. I have to now do something with them. My body will not let me go through that process unless I've got a plan for that free carbon. Because I can't break in half. Amazing. Here's what's going to happen. If I have those three carbon molecules and I don't have anywhere I can put that carbon, you're not going to go through that process. It's going to stop it. You're going to start building up pyruvate. Now, at the same time, you're breaking ATP for fuel. That's called ATP hydrolysis. All right. You have water that comes in. You have an endocene and three phosphates. That's why it's called ATP. Then it's in triphosphate one, two, three. You break one of those phosphates off. There you go. There's energy. So now you have a free for floating in organic phosphate and an adenosine dye phosphate. So two over there. Amazing. That actually results because you use water for it. Results any free-floating hydrogen ion. Just have to trust me hydrogen H2O. Any idea what a free-floating hydrogen is? It's going to. That's acid. Yes. I was going to say it's going to increase acidity. That's anyone that's ever measured pH, what you're really measuring is the amount of hydrogen. Potential hydrogen. That's what pH is. 100% are there's two definitions of pH, but you get. That's one of the two. Are you going to tell me this is related to the burn? We're going to get close. So I've got a bunch of free-floating. You've got the phosphates, which are actually a problem to probably more of a problem than people realized and that hydrogen. What are you going to do with that hydrogen? One thing you can do is actually ship it over to pyruvate and bond it there. We have a special name for that little molecule and you have pyruvate and you have a hydrogen attached to it. Do you know what's called? Hydrogen peroxide. Lactate. Lactite, Lactic acid. This is that whole system. Again, I'm skipping some steps, making a little bit of mistakes here. Intentionally folks just to make this as soon. So what happens when you start running a bunch of anaerobic glycolysis? You start seeing massive rises in lactate. Cool. Not lactate, can't say. Right. That's why we see associations between a lot of lactate and a lot of fatigue. But the lactate is actually not causing the fatigue. The lactate is actually sparing you from having a bunch of free-floating acid. It's also can be then used directly back in the muscle because as soon as you bring in enough oxygen and you can take that hydrogen back off of it, you've now turned it right back into pyruvate and you can run it through this whole cycle as fuel that I'm about to do. You can actually actually ship it out of the exercising muscle and ship it into a non-excircising muscle and then go backwards and make glucose. What actually liberates hydrogen from lactate? You know, chemically? Yeah. So what liberates? What are the stimuli that can take hydrogen off the pyruvate and then in other words to reduce lactate and free up that hydrogen? Oxygen availability. So in fact, one of the major places that you ship hydrogen to or one of the major places that you ship lactate to is your heart because it's what we call like the ultimate solitude fiber and it has a ton of freely available mitochondria, which have a ton of access to oxygen so it can actually then go to it form water. They still can be used to form water and now we have a place to sort of hydrogen. Got it. Right? Cool. So as a result of anaerobic and like holasis, we have made a little bit of ATP. We've created a lot of waste and we don't have anywhere to go with these end products. So when you do anything of a higher intensity and it says I need energy fast, you're going to go to this system first, right? Right past ATP because it is the fastest place to get energy but you're not going to get much of it and you got to deal with the waste products. Boom. Right back to the beginning of our conversation. Endurance is about two things. Energy production and waste management and we're right, we're fatigue buffering. This is it. Right? How well can you handle the elevations in hydrogen, right drop and pH and how and then what are you going to do with these products? If you want to fully metabolize a carbohydrate, you then have to take something with those pyruvates or those acetylcoes, which are going to do if oxygen is available, you will take those things and ship them into the mitochondria. They have to go through, so sell walls and some other things like that. But they're going to get inside there. Once they're in there that two carbon acetylcoes runs to this entire cycle that we call the creb cycle. That's this really interesting place. That's where B6 and NMN people are like that's where that whole stuff starts to kick and all your B-vide events basically run that entire circle and you're going to start off the top. You have a bunch of fun stuff going on. But as a part of that circle, you're going to pull off some hydrogen ions. You're going to send these to what's called the electron transport chain. That's where you're going to get a ton of ATP out of and as a result about halfway through the turn, you're going to pull off one carbon and about halfway through the other, but almost the other way through the finish, you're going to pull off the second carbon. So you're going to take the second acetylcoes run that entire thing the same through as well. And so what we did is we started off with a six carbon glucose chain. We split it in half. We call those pyruvate. Made a little bit of energy because we broke that one bond of those two carbons that are in the middle. Cool. Those two three carbon molecules. We pulled one carbon off of each. We brought in. We sorry, we moved those into the mitochondria. We brought one off. We took a breath, brought in some oxygen, bonded that, brought took out two CO2 excels. We ran the acetylcoes through the creb cycle. One two carbons per turn coming out of CO2. So we had six carbon totals we started and we exceeded with zero carbons. Now we have fully metabolized a molecule of carbohydrate. That required an anerovic start and an aerobic finish. If you don't have a lot of mitochondria, large mitochondria, high functioning mitochondria, you're going to limit your anerovic performance because you're going to get that you're going to run that door full very, very quickly. You can't go past it because hydrogen will build up way too fast and one of the things that we know is both temperature and pH run enzyme function. So they're going to stop. You only mean to be able to run through in fact that ATP hydrolysis phase. Even if I gave you a whole infinite supply of ATP, if I put enough acid in there, it would stop working because the ATPase enzyme needed to split, I won't be able to run in a highly acidic environment or a hot environment. Yeah, at some point, perhaps today, perhaps in the future discussion, but still not too far from now. We could talk about the role of temperature in the in-pirovated in terms of its regulation muscle contraction. But I want to make sure I understood something correctly. You mentioned these two parallel fuel systems. One is essentially anerovic, and the other is aerobic. You said that if we can't pull enough, if we can't break enough bonds, then we limit our anerovic capacity. Correct. I would have thought given that the mitochondria are the site for essentially for aerobic metabolism, that we would be limiting our aerobic capacity as well. Perhaps you could just clarify for me how these two things are divided or is there not a clean division? Is there not an either? No, in fact, again, I think it's better to think of these things rather as two separate parallel things as one big cycle. They're one gear turning the next. Being compromised in one will compromise the other. That, I should say, reminds me of what you said earlier, which is the the bicycle gear analogy that works great. If you short-circuit one, basically the chain can't move. That's yeah, fantastic. Indeed, they are running in parallel, but they are independent. Yeah, well, they're actually not even running in parallel because they're actually fomelling to the same endpoint, which is like if you're going to come from the anerovic glycolysis route, or you're going to come from the fat route, which I'll talk about in a second, they're both going to be limited in the mitochondria. So when that thing's full, it doesn't matter. You can't run either system. Right? So it is more of like a, again, if you're running the bike gears, it doesn't really matter if the back one's larger or smaller because if either one is limited, your toast because they're running on the same system. You can you can sneak a little bit here in there, but not much. You also really nicely highlighted how lactate the thing that we think of as a limiting factor. The burn gets in the way and it's the thing we need to stop and buffer and all sorts of things. Sure, it's actually really a fuel. It's a, it's a tremendous effect of fuel. Yeah, is a, is a strongly preferred fuel, actually. The, is essentially, this is a very classic case of association, correlation versus causation. Right? So the original actually, like there's a really cool history on lactate, but it was originally found, I think in Germany, pardon my history there. Somewhere in Europe in hunted stacks. So one of the things is they sort of realizes like if we, if we harvested a stack and I rest of state when it didn't know we were there versus if we chased it and it was ran down that these lactate concentrations were significantly higher in the latter situation. Therefore lactate started immediately getting this association between high fatigue points and it is easy to measure. If you're to any sort of lactate sort of metabolic test, you will see as fatigue increases, lactate will also increase. The assumption there was then, oh my gosh, is the cause. Now we know, like again, it's not the thing, it's, in large part, trying to buffer the negative consequences of ATP hydrolysis and some other things. So it is certainly playing a part in that role, but it is not a core driver. It's also why you don't need to worry about doing things to quote unquote reduce lactate in the muscle after exercise or to clear lactate or any of those things. You may still want to do those activities, but not for that reason. Lactate's fine, you're actually going to use it and again, the neighboring exercise muscle fibers in the same muscle. Another muscle, you can send it actually to the, to the liver and it can actually go through gluconeogenesis and it can actually replenish liver glycogen, just as I feel source or you send the harder any number of sources. You can also just kind of put in circulation, put it back in the muscle and once enough oxygen is there, you can just kick it right back into either glucose or glycogen. It's totally fine. So it is obviously clear though. Once that number gets very, very high, other things are going to be happening that are because I'm a lot of hurt and this is your managing waste, right? It is really an issue of managing what am I going to do with all this extra carbon? What am I going to do with all this extra energetic phosphate and some other nasty byproducts? But that's the thing you have to deal with. I'd love for you to teach me how different ratios of fuel sources are used depending on how long I happen to be exercising. For example, if I do a very short bout of exercise, typically, that's correlated with a higher intensity output. I suppose I could jog for one minute, but here I'm thinking about sprinting for one minute or less, which fuels our use? Is that mainly driven by fat, stores by carbohydrate stores? Is it driven by dietary fat, preferentially, or carbohydrate that I've ingested if indeed I've ingested those? Or protein for that matter? And then as we transition to exercise, it goes a little bit longer, anywhere from three to five minutes, how do those ratios change? And as we transition to longer duration, what most people think of as endurance exercise, but longeration output of 20 minutes or more leading it all the way up to full marathon, how does that change the ratio of fuel sources that are used? And I'd be particularly interested in distinguishing between carbohydrate, fat, and protein that's ingested. So coming from food sources, or carbohydrate, fat, and protein that are coming from storage sites within the body. Okay, great. Let's start at zero seconds and run all the way through marathon. And we'll flag the distinctions where they start changing. As soon as you want to create muscle contraction in power, the very first source of energy is fossil creating. That's going to power you for zero to maybe say eight to 15, 20 seconds of maximal exertion. And that's incoming from the muscle fibers themselves. Yeah, that is actually stored in the, what's called the cytoplasm. So this is a little area or space in the muscle fiber that's sort of like in this jelly-like substance. And it's nice because one molecule of fossil creatine gives you one molecule of ATP. So it's not a big energy output, but it's very fast because it is stored right there in the local exercising muscle. Right. Now, if you need energy past that point, say, you know, 10 or 15 seconds up to maybe a couple of minutes, this is now you're going to have to transition because you're going to burn through that fossil creatine and it's going to be out. You're going to have to move to now carbohydrate metabolism. This is what we call anaerobic glycolysis. So there's two phases of glycolysis. Now glycolysis itself means glucose burning. All right. So just means we're using carbohydrate as a fuel source. So initially, when we start off this cascade, which is going to take us again for a couple of minutes, carbohydrate utilization comes first from the exercising muscle. So it's very similar to fossil creatine that way. If you start running low on it, you can actually start pulling blood glucose. And if blood glucose gets low, you'll have to start getting glycogen from the liver to keep that up. And we sort of cover that conversation. All right. So a little bit of chemistry here. Just give me a little bit of room here. So now, remember, a carbohydrate is a carbon molecule that has been hydrated. So one carbon attached to one water and remember water is H2O. Most of the time we're talking about glucose, it is in the six carbon chain. So six carbons attached to six water molecules. All right. Great. When I go to split this up through anaerobic glycolysis, it works a little bit like this. So you've got this six carbon chain. The first step is to snap that thing in half. You're going to make two three carbon chains. Now we broke one bond right there. So we got a little bit of energy, but not a tremendous amount. At the end of anaerobic glycolysis, you're going to net something like three or four ATP. So more than you get from the fossil creatine. Tripple is called droople. But still not very much. There's another major downside that's coming in a second to this system. The upside is it's fast. Now, why don't actually one adaptation we get to training in this style? Is you'll increase your ability to store glycogen in your muscle? What's this great? We can actually buy up to you and measure the amount that you store and a training adaptation is awesome. So you're able to sustain the system longer. So perhaps 90 seconds into your interval training. You hit a fatigue point. Now you maybe can extend that to 100 or 115 seconds simply because you're storing more glycogen in the muscle. Before we have to end then go into the blood and get it in the form of glucose. So that's great. So we've got this six carbon molecule and we split this in half. We got that a little bit of ATP. And now we're in this little tricky position because this three carbon molecule is what we call pyruvate pyruvic acid. And again chemistry folks, I'm skipping some steps. I'm going to intentionally make some mistakes here. I'm making sure the entire world listening regardless of where they come in can follow me here. Okay? So don't burn me on the details. Right. You've got this pyruvate. The problem is you can no longer do anything with that glycologist is over. You've got to make a choice. Right. In order to make something out of those three carbon molecules, you've got to shift them to the mitochondria. As you said, that is the only place of aerobic metabolism. Right. We cannot do aerobic metabolism anywhere else until we enter the mitochondria. So anytime we cross that barrier, we know we've automatically switched from anaerobic to aerobic. Well here's the problem. If you were to take one more carbon off that three carbon pyruvate, you have to now do something with that carbon waste. Okay? So before when we split this six carbon chain, we didn't actually leave any carbon's free floating. We just split it too molecule and half. When we go to split it from pyruvate and make it into this two carbon molecule called acetylcoA or acetylcoA, now we've got a free floating carbon. We have to have a strategy for that because that's going to increase the acidity level. Any enzyme on our body that works to create fuel is very pH sensitive. Right. So if this thing, if pH gets off either high or low, these enzymes can't work and that's really really important because even if I were to give you a direct injection of ATP, remember that's that energy currency. That's the only way we can actually form energy. I guess remember to clarify anytime we're using phosphocreatin or glucose or fat which will get to a second. We're not actually getting energy for exercise by breaking those down. We're getting energy that we can use to then make ATP. We break that ATP down. That was actually powering muscle contraction. You can go back to our previous episode where we walked you through the detail of the muscle contraction. But that's where after. Okay? So in the case of pyruvate, if we split that off, we have got to deal with that and the only way in the best way we can deal with that is oxygen. Remember, we're going to breathe in 02. That 02 is going to combine with that free floating carbon makes CO2. We're going to exhale that thing out. That's our waste management strategy. But that has to happen in the mitochondria. Remember, if we're using oxygen, it has to be in the mitochondria. So if we have the ability to ship pyruvate into the mitochondria, we're golden. But what happens if we don't? Why do we not? Well, if we don't have enough mitochondria or mitochondria to small or they're too far away or we don't have sufficient oxygen availability. Why don't we have sufficient oxygen availability? Because we created the pyruvate too fast. And the demand in the mitochondria is exceeded by the buildup of pyruvate. And so now we're having this giant backlog and this thing fills up fast. We have a couple of strategies here. Well, when you're going through ATP and you're splitting, it's called HP Hydrolysis. In, I'll do that. Remember, ATP is a what I denysing molecule and then the T part is triphosphate 123, which means you have three phosphates attached at the end. When you break that phosphate off, that's where you get to energy. So now you have an energetic phosphate and an ADP, it doesn't die phosphate too. That process requires water. It's called hydrolysis. As a result of that, you then have a free floating hydrogen. And as you will know, that is acid. That's potential hydrogen. That's what that means. And so you've increased the acidity in the muscle by breaking up all this ATP. And so, oh, we're building up acid. We have building up pyruvate. We know no more to go with it. And we can't cleave off a carbon because now we're just going to exacerbate the acid increase. So what we can do is we can take those hydrogens that we're building up and store them on the pyruvate. A pyruvate that's holding an extra acid has a special name and we call that lactate. So that's why we see this build up of lactate. So one of the downsides of anaerobic hypothesis is an incredibly high rate of waste production. Now lactate is not the cause of fatigue. In fact, if you think a little bit more carefully about what I just said, it's actually stopping you. It's what we call a acid buffer. You can actually use it for a bunch of everything. You can ship it to a neighboring muscle fiber in the same muscle that's not working. You can ship it to the liver. You can ship it to the heart and a bunch of other places. And then you can actually just work backwards. So if you ship it to a, for example, the heart and it's got a bunch of mitochondria that are free, you can bring in the oxygen attached it to that hydrogen, make water and now you're right back to pyruvate. You put two pyruvate back together and now you just make glucose. So you can actually store it in the liver. This is the process called gluconeogenesis through this fancy thing called the choricycle, which is what the, the proper cycle here is. So you can use it as a very potent fuel source. In fact, lactate is a tremendously valuable fuel source. I'm not only for exercise, but for cognition and a bunch of other things. So lactate, in fact, this is why if you've seen in the research about pre-exam testing exercise, you'll see a noticeable increase in exam scores if you do a 20 minute about a vector size prior to take an exam. And it's largely, in part, probably because of things like elevations in lactate. How intense a vector size would be most beneficial I don't know that exact answer. I just know that generally any form of exercise is good, but if you were to reach a reasonably high heart rate, you're probably going to see say, in fact, there's an acute and chronic adaptation here. So folks, I'd exercise, I've had better, memory retention, score, and exam, et cetera, but then also doing it prior to that exam, make sure you recover and rest in back down the straight, but you'll generally perform better. Previous guests on the humor and lapar gas, who's the, who's a psychology professor in neuroscience and also dean of College of Arts and Sciences at New York University, NYU, Wendy Suzuki, is religious about daily morning exercise, specifically for this purpose of enhancing learning and memory and has a lot of really beautiful data. I consider one of the real pioneers in this space. So if people want to learn more, they can look to that episode or Wendy's work. We can write a link to a couple of the papers, but this is fantastic and that it's incredibly clear. I think for the first time I'm understanding what lactate is really doing and it's dispelling a lot of myths that I think I and a lot of other people arrive to the discussion about lactate with. What happens when the bout of exercise extends longer? Amazing. So if we want to continue past that we have to have some sort of strategy to get through it right? We're stuck. We're out of gas. We have to then ship it to the mitochondria and now we're going to enter what's called a roboc, the glycalthosis. And this is going to take us anywhere from, again, say that 90 seconds of all that work up to really 20, 30 minutes. In fact, it really will take us to unlimited. If you look at a highly competitive marathon runner, even those that are running say you're two hour marathon, those folks are burning up to 80% carbohydrate. It is a, it is not a fat burning thing. And the reason is fat metabolism is way too slow. It provides a lot of energy, but it is incredibly slow. If you're trying to run a four and a half or so minute mile, repeated 26 times, you have to be moving fast. Are they ingesting carbohydrate as a fuel source during the race? Unless you're on the team, you don't know. They won't really tell you these are sort of trade secrets. It would be, I would say, fairly rare to not have something. There's a bunch of different strategies. If you're going to go really long, like some of these cycling, where the races will be several hours, then you actually might go to some fat as fuel sources. I know a lot of cyclists are using ketones and things like that now. But traditionally, most endurance folks are going to buy us heavily towards carbohydrate. Now, in one respect, you're not going to run on a carbohydrates until you're many hours in. These folks are a unique case, but the average individual who's doing an hour, hour and a half cardio, even, you're not going to be limited by your carbohydrate source. You're going to be just fine. You're going to be limited by some other things, which will maybe sort of break down here in a second, but you're going to be fine there. A lot of those folks will take carbohydrate though. I'm very specific intervals. You do want to be careful, though, of ingesting too many fast carbohydrates prior to your exercise spell. We actually have this little thing that's called the insulin glucose double whammy. What that means is when you ingest carbohydrates immediately, your blood glucose goes up and that's depending on the type of carbohydrate and things like that. The same thing happens with exercise. What happens is insulin wants to start pulling glucose out of the blood. At the same time, muscle wants to start pulling glucose out of the blood. So we have this giant bowl of carbohydrates coming in and then all of a sudden, our blood sugar crashes. And so if you're going to be doing so, your first half marathon or something like that, and you're in those giant corals, with like, you know, 100 people waiting to go in your standing for 45 minutes, you may or may not want to slow down like three or four bananas in a bagel and and honey and think like you probably don't need that. Now, not everyone experiences this double whammy, but it has been shown in the literature to happen to some people. So you want to just be a little bit careful. In easy way to combat that is just practice exactly what you're going to do in your race in your training. That's the simplest advice ever, but you'd be stunned how many people do things during the race that they've actually never done in training. I suggest people do exactly what you describe also for any kind of cognitive testing. Of course. Before a big exam is not the time to discover whether or not you can handle twice as much espresso or take a new tropec for the first time or or change anything. I mean, if indeed the the score on that exam is meaningful to you, you keep things regular. So to recap what we've done here is we started off in the side of plaza with this glucose molecule that is six carbons. We took that thing. We split that thing. Anorobic glycolysis. We made a little bit of energy, but not much. We take those three carbons molecules. We ship them into the mitochondria. We take each one of those. We clear off one carbon each. Those carbons. We take a breath and we attach them to oxygen. We exhale them. Get rid of that energy. We are now fully into a robotic glycolysis. Each one of those two carbons molecules we run through the creb cycle. Each round the creb cycle burns one, two carbons. So we go one, two, one, two. And now we've gone from six carbon molecule all the way down to zero. We used the hydrogens that we pulled off of that creb cycle run to go to the electron transport chain from there. We made a whole bunch of ATP. And so we have now fully metabolized one molecule of carbon hydrate. And the end product of all of it is simply ATP water and CO2. Beautiful. And leads me to the conclusion that most everything is really about utilization of carbons and exhaling CO2. Is that how I should think about bookending what you just described? This is why we started off the conversation with the circle of a life. This is really a carbon game. This is why we call chemistry with carbon organic chemistry. That's what the whole thing is about. Any living being has to run through metabolism. It's all a carbon game. Any living being has to use ATP. This is all just a big fancy game. If how do I make ATP and handle the waste. Remember, endurance is all about waste management, fatigue resistance, the same thing and energy production. We're playing a game here. The whole game bringing energy use it, mitigate waste products. So in thinking about aerobic exercise or long duration exercise. In this case, anything longer than five minutes for that matter. Five minutes all the way up to an ultra marathon. The breathing associated with endurance exercise. The heart beating, which of course is associated with the breathing in voice versus it's really all about bringing oxygen into the system that allows those carbons to be used within the mitochondria specifically. Then carbon dioxide to be exhaled as we work through the carbons of the sort of beads on a string. Is that right? Unless you're moving incredibly fast for a very long time. We're talking probably north of 90 minutes. And endurance is really not a game of making sure I have enough fuel. It is simply managing the waste production. And that's exactly what you describe. You need to bring in the oxygen so you can handle the carbon that's building up as a result of both the anaerobic anaerobic like causes. That's our game here. If we start talking about endurance if it's longer than that, now we do have to start worrying about running out of muscle glycogen, running out of liver glycogen, et cetera. Or if we are at that two-hour mark or so when we're moving very very very fast. But anything south of that is just managing carbon build up and we do that best through oxygen utilization or getting more efficient and having a higher capacity for our anaerobic side. So we can do that by having either more glycogen in our muscle. So that last longer or building better acid buffering systems. And there's a whole line of supplementation that are specifically acid buffers. There's a whole line of training. There's a whole line of breathing to manage this that. So we have a lot of strategies where we can maximize endurance. All we have to do is go back to the earlier part of our talk, which is figure out what's the actual limiting step and then train according to that or do your strategy, nutrition, your supplementation that defeats that limiting factor. For an example, if you are trying to maximize your performance in this 20-second maximal burst and your strategy for that was to make sure that your muscle glycogen is saturated. It's probably not going to help a ton because you're not going to be limited by total fuel. You're going to be limited by your ability to buffer acid. However, storing more glycogen in muscle and preparation for a marathon is a tremendously effective strategy because that will become a limiting factor. So what we can do actually next if you'd like is we can just walk through these and look at the individual limitations where the failure point happens and then that effectively will outline your strategy for improving them. So you taught us about carbohydrate utilization as a fuel source. What about fat and what about protein? Great. I'll start with protein because it's easy. It is generally at best going to represent 10% of your energy output. Now that will grow over time in terms of if you did a several hour about a vector size. When you started doing it, you might be using 5% of your energy from protein and then that micro to 10 or so. That happens because you start running low and muscle glycogen. You start running low and liver glycogen. You start then having to pull an energy from another place. So like as those numbers go down, you'll see an increased uptick of energy from fat as well as protein. Having said that, it's not a tremendous fuel source. It is only a rubric. So it has to be oxidized. Those are the same thing when I say oxidized. You use oxygen to burn something to make a fuel. So it's not a significant contributor to energy in that regard. And unless you're talking ultramarithons are longer and it is also not something that can enhance performance. And so we don't really need to talk much more about it than that. In terms of fat as a fuel source, now here's the fundamental difference. While carbohydrate starts anaerobicly and finishes aerobicly in the mitochondria, you're using mostly the carbohydrate in the exercising muscle tissue. Eventually you can pull from blood and then you can pull from the liver. With fat, you have a tiny amount stored in the muscle, intramuscular trigosterides. But the overwhelming majority of fuel you get from fat comes systemically. And so now we have a fundamental difference. We actually literally have a time problem. I can get energy from carbohydrates faster because it is directly there. If I go to pull it from fat, I've got to pull it from the rest of the body, which is why somebody who loses fat, loses it from their entire body. Despite the fact that they may be only exercising a couple of parts. So think about it, runner. Someone who lost a lot of fat running. You don't see them just lose fat in their legs. It comes from their face and their neck and everywhere. Why? Because what you're going to do is pull fat from the entire system. You're going to break it down through a process called life policies, which is a means you break it down from the stored form. You put it in the blood as that glycerol, back one, which is that three carbon backbone. In the individual fatty acids, it's going to float through the blood. There's a seven step system here, but we'll skip it for now. It's going to have to get then uptaken into the muscle. In the muscle, then it has to get taken up and run into the mitochondria. Now, that backbone, that three carbon glycerol backbone is actually going to function almost exactly like the three carbon pyruvate. Just get it into the mitochondria. Clear off one carbon, runner is asked to co-a, bottoming, but it will be exact same thing. Super easy to metabolize small enough to go through the mitochondria membrane. The fatty acid change becomes a problem. So, if you have a chain that's longer than our eight or so carbons, it has to actually go through a special transporter on the cell wall to get in. And that's going to be limited by a thing called carnitine. And you're probably familiar with that as a supplement. You've may have talked about it. There's a lot of places that make it. That's going to be limiting factor. If it is a smaller, what we call a short chain or even a medium chain, a checklist right, which a lot of folks have heard of MCT, that's what we're talking about. That can actually go directly through because it's small enough to pass through and you can use it immediately as an energy source. In either case, the way that you finally metabolize a fatty acid is a process where you would go through and cut off two carbons at a time. Why would you cut off two? Because you're trying to make that two carbon acid in a coase, you can run through that Krebs cycle again. Because you're cutting off two carbons at a time, we have a special name for that oxidation process. It's called beta oxidation. That's exactly why we call it beta oxidation. Two carbons in, you cut it off to make that acetocoa. So, you can notice the oxidation pathway, the electron transport pathway is identical, whether you're talking about the carbohydrates or the fat. In fact, it doesn't even matter. More to our point, if we're talking about simply fat loss, it really just is about running that electron transport chain, whether it came from a carbohydrate or regional source or a fat or regional source, it ends up in the mitochondria as basically the exact same thing. At then ends, the end of metabolism as the same thing. Remember, the final endpoint of carbohydrate metabolism is water, ATP, and CO2. Do you want to guess the final endpoint of fat metabolism? It's water, ATP, and CO2. So, practical applications here. If you want to maximize fat loss, what type of training is best? It really doesn't matter. If you enjoy longer steady state stuff, fantastic. If you enjoy intervals, amazing. If you would like to do a combination, that's my personal preference. That's great too. You have a ton of options. Pick what you think is a combination of challenging. Not all exercise should be easy, but you actually enjoy somewhat or you're willing to accept. And anything that you absolutely hate, don't do it. Sometimes is very, very, very difficult to do high intensity training. You have to really be interested in doing it. If not, it ends up turning into like moderate intensity training. You sort of just check the box. And it doesn't work that well if you're just checking the box. So, if you're like man, mentally, I don't have it in me today to get to a high heart rate and throw up and all that stuff. Cool. But you can just do some moderate steady state stuff. Well, that's a win. Great. If you're like, oh my gosh, more than 10 straight minutes, and I'm so bored. And you're all, maybe you're also like, I don't have 45 minutes. I got to get this done in eight minutes. Great. Good to some high intensity animals. Either option will be equally effective. As you mentioned earlier, exercise is useful for aesthetic changes, functionality, and for longevity. But when thinking about exercise specifically for fat loss, I do have to ask this question. I often hear from people that they prefer one type of exercise versus another for sake of fat loss, because certain forms of exercise make them very hungry. I'm wondering whether or not there's any relationship between the intensity or type of exercise and the hunger stimulus. Now, I don't have this problem because basically everything makes me hungry. And yet, I'm also okay fasting for part of the day. Yeah. I'm one of those pseudo intermittent fasters. Talk about what I mean by that. I just have an e-B between 11am and 8pm naturally. I'm not religious about it, but but I don't do it for any other reason, except that tends to be when I'm hungry and exercise outside of that in the morning typically. In any case, is there a way that people can determine what type of exercise might be better worse for them based on its appetite stimulating or inhibiting effects because I also hear that some people will go for a long run and then they are going to go not hungry for several hours afterwards. Does that have anything to do with which fuels are being utilized during different forms of exercise? That's actually a really good question. I don't know the mechanisms that could explain that answer. What I can tell you is you're the same comment for physical activity. In other words, people say, man, if I do this type of training, then I just am exhausted and I lay around the rest of the day. So my total caloric expenditure is actually compromised as an aggregate because I'm down. The data would suggest in general that doesn't happen. So most of the time we don't see a reduction in physical activity with either high intensity or steady state training. In fact, you generally see equal if not increased or what's called neat. The non-exercising part of your day, in addition to the basal metabolic rate. So physical activity why she don't send to be frapp. Now hunger is a little bit of a different thing. The answer here is, I don't think we have time to actually do justice on this. So perhaps best to not get into this one. Yeah, why don't we plant this down the road to our discussion about nutrition specifically and we back to it. So we'll ear market for that. Meanwhile, it sounds like if one is thinking purely in terms of burning calories and getting the health benefits of exercise to create a caloric deficit to create fat loss, it doesn't matter whether or not they burn those calories using a form of exercise that relies predominantly on carbohydrate, fat or protein. Correct. It's not that it doesn't matter. It's that either one will work because when we say things like that, it doesn't mean they're actually identical. There are some slight differences and maybe those differences are important for some people and others. Audit says either one is a viable strategy. Great. What about protein as a fuel? As an actual fuel, so let me give you an analogy. Imagine that you are with me a few weeks ago in Southern Montana and we were out in the wilderness for a week. And it's cold out there and you need to make a fire. And if I said, look, you can pick any of these things there. There's some wood over there. We brought some newspaper and then we brought a match and we need to create a fire. We're going to use that fire to energy and heat up. Okay, I said great. The very first place you would probably start to make that fire is the match. You like the match and any match, hey, it's going to light immediately, but it's probably going to last five to 20 seconds. I don't know before it burns out. That's fossil creating. Real fast. Real burns out. If you were smart, you would take that match and then light the newspaper on fire. Right? Now, if you were to burn a whole newspaper, it is more energy than you get to the match, but you still, I don't know what's going to take a few minutes, some number of minutes before an entire newspaper burns up. Yeah, five. I don't know. Right? Depends on the, which type of newspaper does I guess? Right? Amazing. That's carbohydrate. Right? If you were really smart, you would use that said then light a piece of wood on fire. And the wood, if you've been in the wilderness, it can last hours, days. It's really quite unlimited. Your fossil creating storage is very limited, small. glycogen is a lot higher because you can store it in muscle. You can store it in other places. So you have more, but not a lot. Fat is unlimited. The average person, if you're around to say 70 kilos, up 170 pounds or so. And you're moderately lean. Maybe 15% body fat. Nothing crazy. You probably have enough stored fat to create enough energy to survive for more than 30 days. Right? This would literally mean if you ingested zero calories, you have enough fuel and your stored fat to keep you alive for certainly 30 days. You wouldn't feel good and all those things. But energetically, basically fat will never, ever be your limiting factor of performance. So when we start talking about what limits my performance in these areas, you can just wipe fat off the list. It will never be your limiting factor to any type of endurance performance. You simply have way too much. The only problem with fat is it's just to slow. I've got to mobilize it. I've got to get in the blood, move it, that whole thing. Too slow. So if I want to go faster, I will never be able to fully utilize fat, which is why we talked about earlier. You'll never see a situation in which somebody is 100% burning fat as a fuel and no percent carbohydrate. It's always going to be too slow. Highest you'll get maybe 70% protein in this equation. Is none of that. Now you may notice how do you make paper? What's the fibers you can mind with water that you get to press? Yeah. Yeah. It's made from wood. How do you make a match? It's made from wood. What's carbohydrate? A chain of carbon. What's fat? A chain of carbon. These are similar molecules, right? They're meant to give you pros and cons. It's very difficult to just light a log on fire without a lot of work. You have to burn, burn, burn, burn, burn. So these are complementary systems that are really close to the same thing. Protein is none of those things. Protein is more like a piece of metal. So if you were out in the woods with me and we were trying to make a fire and you're like, hey, look, I found some old railroad over there. Let's throw that on there. I would probably look at you like here. He's now technically, can you melt metal? Sure. But you're going to burn a lot of energy to try to get a little bit back out of the metal. And now you've also cost yourself a very, very valuable structure. So protein is a fuel source for exercise or metabolism. It's just an incredibly poor choice. Your body will do it. Again, maybe five to 10%. But you're now you're burning a very valuable supply in a situation in which you don't know where there's ever going to be anymore. Remember, protein is fairly transient. It's not very good at storing it. You can store a ton of carbohydrate and an unlimited literally amount of fat. So you just really need to disregard thinking about protein as a fuel source. Your body does not want to do it. You're not good at it. You can go through a process of gluconeogenesis from protein, make glucose from it. It's just very poor. You're not going to get much out of the exchange and you've burned your supply of metal, which is going to be very difficult. It's a very high commodity in the woods or the wilderness to have something like metal. For people that consume very low carbohydrate or zero carbohydrate diets, are they pulling more energy from muscle, so which I imagine is a conversion of amino acids into ready carbon chains. Yeah, I mean, in this particular case, once you've reached a certain level of adaptation, you've just gotten extremely good at generating glucose from other fashions. So you can bias heavily towards fat adaptation. The downside is, and we've seen this born in the literature, you're going to perform slower. So if you don't care about maximizing performance, especially over something where it is a maximal effort for a few minutes or something, then maybe you're not concerned. And that's absolutely great, especially for people just don't exercise. Then hey, she's very little concern here. But if you're interested in your performance and you're wondering why you're just like slugging it down, well, what you've done is you've down regulated the ability, literally the enzymes responsible for that entire anaerobic glycolysis portion, they get down regulated, which means there's not as much around anymore. And so you get really bad and slow at using carbohydrates as a fuel source. So it's a very poor strategy for people in an anaerobic based sport or who like that type of activity. You can't if you don't care. No problem. If you don't exercise at all, then you really have no problem there, which is actually why a high fat low carb hydrate nutrition strategy for people who don't do much physical activity. It's probably like very effective. It is a really good strategy for weight management, for energy stabilization throughout the day, and the research would very much support that. In my observation, I would agree. I've tried low carb hydrate diets of severely limiting or completely limiting carbohydrate. And after about two or three days, I feel pretty lousy, but mostly because I want to train very intensely in the gym. In addition to doing longer runs, I tend to do all of those things across the week. But I've also observed, in fact, no several people that love the very low carbohydrate, a ketogenic type diet. They're not doing ketogenic diet for mental health reasons per say. But indeed, those people tend to do very limited exercise or they tend to do a lot of long endurance, but low intensity, long endurance. These are the, I walk to get my exercise types, and they do indeed walk a lot. And some of them managed to control their weight very readily and like that diet for that reason. When we had laying northern on the podcast, he pointed out quite aptly that in order to lose weight, you have to restrict something either. Of course, time or macro nutrients, etc., to arrive at that sub-chloric threshold. Get below that sub-maintenance threshold. I guess one of the things I want to point out is this should be used received as again, not a, this is better or worse. This is just, you now have a ton of options. So whatever personal preference, other factors, you get to craft this strategy of performance, aesthetics, and health based on your personal preferences. At this point, I'd like to go back to our classic list of nine adaptations that exercise can induce. The first four, of course, being largely, largely unrelated to today's conversation, but that were covered in the episode that we did on strength, speed, and hypertrophy. So just to remind people, the nine adaptations are number one, skill and technique, two speed, three power, which is speed times four, four strength, and five hypertrophy. Today we're talking about the remaining adaptations on that list, starting with muscular endurance followed by anaerobic capacity followed by maximum aerobic output and finishing at number nine with long duration exercise. So if we could start with muscular endurance, this would be number six on the list of nine adaptations, muscular endurance. How do I build muscular endurance? Why should I build muscular endurance? And just to remind me what fuel sources are predominating when I'm training for muscular endurance. Great. So remember, muscular endurance is something that's going to be generally in a local muscle. It is not a cardiovascular systemic and it tends to be something in the neighborhood of say five to maybe even up to 50 repetitions. So this is the classic example. If you're as how many push-ups can you do in a row? Most people are going to land somewhere that range. I just said, how many sit-ups can you do in a minute? And how many pull-ups, how long can you hang on a bar as a dead hang? Things like that. That's muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is not a mild run or a marathon or anything like that. So how long can I stand while without breaking posture? This is muscular endurance. A plank of walls. Great. Yes. Love all these things. Okay. Now, the reason I took you on that big long metabolism journey is so I could help you understand exactly how to train this factor. Any of these factors with a more comprehensive understanding of what's happening. Meaning, thinking back to the metabolism. If I'm going to ask my triceps to do 50 push-ups in a row, what's going to be my limiting factor? Am I going to run out of fat? No chance. Am I going to run out of glycogen? No chance. That's way too few of repetitions. You have a lot left there. So what's going to be the thing that stops from getting 51 repetitions? Either you're going to have too high of a pH rise. So too much acid buildup or you're going to have a problem clearing the waste. So really, this is two factors dealing with acid buildup and getting acid out of the muscle tissue and end the circulation. Because you have plenty of ability to handle that small amount of acid buildup in your entire body. It's just you can't handle it in that tiny spot. Now, I picked the tricep for a very specific reason. You're going to deal with more pain when you use a large muscle group like your quads or your glutes than you are with a small muscle group. For example, nobody ever threw up after arm day. But a lot of people throw up after leg day. Why is that? Look at the total amount of waste that you're dumping in your system when you have quadrupled or 10x the muscle size. Small muscle groups are only really going to be challenged in that local area. Large ones will dump so waste into the system that you want to avoid that as quickly as possible. And that's one of the reasons why you throw up after hard exercise. Great. So the reason I'm laughing because I don't think I've ever thrown up from a weight training session. And so it's making me wonder if I've ever trained that hard. I've received or obtained the progress that I wanted to do generally over time, not every week, every workout, every month. But certainly over the 30 plus years that I would wait training, I've achieved the results I wanted. I have, however, vomited after a long run when I didn't hydrate well. If I drank too much water. Sure. Oh, sure, too much water. Yeah, you'll get that out quick. Right. I just want to be clear because I think some people are getting the picture that if they're not vomiting, hit the end after their leg workout that they're not training according to your standards. Again, by the way, Dr. Andy Galpin runs experiments in his lab. He's recruiting subjects. All of a sudden. Also known as my graduate students. That's right. In any of that, sorry to interrupt. But I felt it was a necessary interruption. So muscular endurance, there's plenty of fuel. Plenty of fuel. You manage acid build up and you also need to get that fuel out of you. That's going to be a capitalization issue. So the way that we can think about this is capitalaries surround your muscle. And the whole point of them is so that blood can come into them. They hit this capitalization. That actually slows the diffusion rate of blood down. And so you can exchange nutrients in and get waste products out. And then we get things back in a circulation. So the more of those you have, the better you are at dispersing any of these waste products build up whether it's CO2 or the acid. So the adaptation you're looking for here is an increase in capitalization, potentially a slight increase in myocondria. But the time is too fast. Right. So we're going to be able to need to do these 50 repetitions and say under a minute or something like that. So getting the mobilization into the mitochondria, getting fuel that way too slow. That's not really going to get our performance here. So water strategies to increase acid buffering ability and then capitalization. So on the capitalization side, you simply need to train at that ability. So you go close to failure and practice that often. That alone will increase blood flow to that local area, which will get take you through your process of increasing capitalization. Easy peasy, specificity. Right. So I have to do that. Just to briefly interrupt, I find it remarkable, although not surprising, giving how amazing the human body is that simply by doing some movement repeat like a wall said or a or pushups or dips for that matter repeatedly over and over and over until you reach that failure point, or that quaking point in the case of a wall set, that provides a stimulus for more capitalaries to be built into the system. Literally the production or the trafficking of endothelial cells, which make up the capitalaries and allow basically more little pipes to feed the system with oxygen and remove waste products. It's a irrigation. Imagine how giant field and you had two big pipes starting down the outside. Well, in fact, if you want to make sure water gets eaten, release, gross, gross, and entire field, you'll have a bunch of off-shooting little pipes and the more those you have, the more coverage you get. Do we know what the specific signal is that says, hey, I failed at this. We need more capitalaries. I actually don't know what that is. I would speculate it's a combination of acidity as well as carbon dioxide and probably some nitric oxide stuff happening there, but I actually don't know. I'm guessing nobody knows for sure because we still don't know for instance what the exact signal is for hypertrophy. It's kind of an amazing situation. We know the requirements for getting the result we want, but we still don't know what the specific signal is. In any event, what I'm hearing is building more capitalaries is great for enhancing muscular endurance and the way to get more capitalaries into those muscles is to train for muscular endurance by getting close to failure or just some point where you simply can't continue for whatever reason. Could you give us an example of what a reasonable training protocol might be in terms of the classic galvanists now, exercise choice, maybe a few options, order, volume and frequency. What should we be doing? How often should we be doing it? For instance, I do waltzits to failure, then pushups to failure. Given that this is a local process, I'm guessing that if I do pushups to failure, I'm not going to increase the number of capitalaries in my legs very much. Correct. So you nailed it. Exercise choice is high precision here. So pick the muscle group and the exact sequencing and movement pattern you want. High precision. This is the thing. If you want to get better to apply and hold a blank, you want to do more pushups, do more pushups. You can do some other stuff. That's complimentary. But really this is a high precision game. Do the exact same thing for exercise choice. Very simple there. Okay. In terms of exercise order, as far as this dovetails with volume. Yeah. Can I combine training, let's say waltzits for my quads and, you know, nearby muscle groups and then do pushups to failure and then also do some sort of pulling exercise to failure? Yep. Absolutely. Again, pick the exercises you want. The movement patterns you want to do and do them. The order almost doesn't matter with the one caveat. With larger muscle groups, particularly again, multiple leg activities. That will induce a small amount of systemic fatigue. And so if you, I guess theoretically, want to maximize your pushup number and you did a whole bunch of say split squats and you just did those and you, you, you know, did lunges for a mile or something like that? You might actually slightly compromise. You might not, but you might slightly compromise your ability to do as many pullups and a row or hold a bent over row or something like that. So if you really cared about that level, then you may be want to do the one that's most important first. In general, my recommendation though is to do the bigger muscle group first. How many sets and how often should one perform training for musculine endurance and when? Now the lovely part here is we've moved down the spectrum past hypertrophy. You don't need a lot of load here. In fact, the load only needs to be at or slightly above what you want to move. So if you want to get better at moving 50% of your one or at max, you don't really need to train much more than 50, maybe 55 or 60% of your one or max. Because if you go higher than that, the repetition counts going to fall and you're no longer going to be training musculine endurance. So you just need to stay right around that number that you want to work on. So again, if the target is doing more pullups and assuming that you have this strength to do it, you check that box. You simply need to practice the repetition range that you want to be in. That's all it takes. You can repeat that a number of times, but because remember, the volume is fairly low, the load is very very low. You can actually repeat these quite frequently. So you won't get extremely sore from musculine endurance relative to traditional hypertrophy training because the load is very very light. So you can do these more frequently if you would like. More frequently, such as you could do it three or four times a week easy. If you would like, you don't necessarily need to. Three days a week per muscle group is probably fine here. If you wanted to do more sets on a given day and do less days, that would be fine. So if you wanted to do two days a week, and you say, wanted to do, let's say you could do 25 pushups and the goal is to get to 30 pushups. Just as an example, you might say, okay, I'm going to do sets of 17 and I'm going to do three sets of that. I'm going to do that three days a week. That's going to build up quite a bit. Or you could say, look, I'm going to do a set basically to failure. I'm going to recover and do one or two sets at say 80%. And I'll do that twice a week. That's going to push the pace pretty well. You're going to have a lot of gains from that. And again, this is not about hypertrophy. This is about muscular endurance. So I do want to emphasize and again, please correct me if I'm talking out of line here. Do want to emphasize that because we mentioned pullups, if you can't get 25 pullups, then and you're doing 10, you're training for hypertrophy. You're not training for muscular endurance. For example, there's a big crossover here. So anytime we're talking past like 15 reps, we're technically in hypertrophy and muscular endurance. Got it. So here's the common mistake. I don't want to get bulky. So I'm going to go lighter and do more reps. And then people grow. And then you landed still right in the middle of hypertrophy. Right. So like, for people who are like, oh my gosh, like every time I lift weights, I blow up. I go lighter. I do more reps. And I you're still right in the hypertrophy. So they'd actually be much better off training very, very heavy in the one to three reps range. They'd get really strong and they wouldn't grow much. Exactly. So tell me if this is a reasonable protocol for what I'm going to call the typical person. In my mind, the typical person, somebody who hopefully is doing resistance training, hitting that 10 sets per muscle group per week minimum to maintain or build strength and hypertrophy. But is also doing some long duration training that we'll talk about in a little bit. Maybe throwing in high intensity work out here, there are some sprints, maybe some ply metrics, some skill-based training. And doing a bunch of different things to be all what I would call all around fit. They're not training for any specific event or trying to maximize any one of the nine adaptations to the exclusion of the others. That person decide, okay, after they do their longer run, they're going to do a plank to max duration. They're going to wall sit to max duration and they do push-ups to max duration. And then also do that same workout before they do their high-intensity training, some other point during the week. And then maybe even do it again on their so-called rest day. Just a real quick five minutes of doing so, build more capillaries into the relevant muscle groups and build their muscular endurance. Yep. Without eating into their overall recovery too much. Too much. Yeah. So again, the nice part about this is they don't hammer you too much. You're not going to get tremendously sore if you keep the load light. The only switch I would make there is I would probably do them after your interval rather than before. So you can make sure you keep quality there and you're not compromised by a local muscular endurance when you're actually trying to get a more systemic fatigue with something like a higher intensity interval training. So that would work fantastic. The only other variable we have in here is progression. And this is very simple. Try to add a rep or two per week. That's really all you have to go after. So if you're up to 22 this week, try to hit 23 next week. For wall sits in planks that would be added at time. Time. Yep. And if you run into a wall there, just like the same concepts we talked about was straying through our approach. We back it down to more like in the 80 or 85% range and accumulate a lot more practice. That's going to help a lot with capitalization as well as asset buffering. So you're going to continue to give yourself signals for up regulation of the processes needed for that. And it's not always pushing you to the end failure. Just like we don't want to always go to failure of a strength. We don't want to always go to failure with high intensity rules either. Same thing would be happening here. What about anaerobic capacity? How should people train for anaerobic capacity? What exactly are they training for? Meaning what is the structural or cellular adaptation or adaptations that are occurring that allow for increases in anaerobic capacity? And why are increases in anaerobic capacity good for us even if we're a quote unquote endurance athlete or we are a recreational exerciseer who is not interested in building more muscle speed or things that I typically associate with anaerobic capacity? Yeah. So this is really really fun. Remember anaerobic capacity is a total amount of work you can do for something like seconds to a few minutes. And this is extremely high levels of fatigue. The highest you're really going to see and by fatigue here I mean acid build up my products. Not fatigue is in like mentally I don't want to do this anymore. So if we just think about the energetic for a second. I'm going to do say let's take a really easy example of people have done that thing where you go to the track and you sprint the straight away as you walk the corners. Remember that sort of thing? Yeah. Tabadas. 30 on 30 off. Things like this. This is what we're talking about in this kind of anaerobic capacity area. Now here's what's going to happen is fat going to be your limiting. No we already made that clear. What about carbohydrates? Well if it's a single bowel rate two or three bowel it's probably not. But if you're doing this for a long time so you're going to go 30 on 30 off or 20 rounds. You may actually start reaching a point of running out of my muscle vicarage. In any of those cases though you're going to be running into an acid problem. If you were to continue to do this multiple repetitions in addition to running low on muscle glycogen you're also going to start running into oxygen transportation problems. Because you're building up a lot of byproducts you gotta continue you will actually cruise into aerobic glycolysis. This is exactly why the community that I have worked a lot with professional fighters. Very high level boxers world champions you have sea fighters. It is a five minute round that you're going to do five times. This is for world championship fight to get one minute break in between. So imagine going like 30 on 30 off or five minutes getting a one minute break and doing that five times. Even though the individual belts are 30 seconds long the entire thing lasts so long it is primarily aerobic. You have to have both capacities. You gotta get really high anaerobic. You also have to have a lot of aerobic going on. You're going to start running into limitations because of heart rate, stroke volume and then even potentially ventilation. The need for oxygen to be able to come in and clear the carbon dioxide totally out of the system becomes a problem because not only are you having so much build up for such a long time. You're also using multiple muscle groups. So now this is a very important distinction. Muscle endurance tends to be localized. Now this is not. If you're doing these intervals you're on a salt bike you're sprinting up a hill you're grappling with somebody. You have a lot of muscles being involved which means all of that waste is being dumped into the central port. You have to clear and I'm by clear it. I know me not out of the muscle. I mean out of the body. So your ability to bring in and utilize oxygen is going to be a major limitation. Do you really do handle this stuff? So what do you do? Well, specificity wins. Practice the exact thing you're talking about. So if you want to get better at sprinting the straightaways and walk in the corners do that. You can't always do it though. You're going to run into limitations. So this is when backing off to a lower intensity is going to give you a lot of benefits. We know very clearly. If you want to improve cardiovascular fitness, high intensity, moderate intensity and low intensity or effective and you actually probably want to do a little bit of all of them. This is why none of our fighters would ever just do high intensity training. There's going to be some moderate. We tend to call this like cardiac output training. You can think of this as like anywhere between zone two to zone four if you like zones. I don't use them personally. So I'm just going to intentionally interrupt you because this issue of zones has come up a few times. I want to make sure everybody's on the same page. You also mentioned that you don't necessarily favor the zone nomenclature. But for those not familiar zone one, two, three, four, all the way up to five is a kind of back of the envelope type verbage for some people and is more precisely followed by for other people. Meaning for me, zone one is simply walking, easy walking. Zone two would be for anybody the pace or intensity of exercise that one could perform while still maintaining a conversation, but just barely. Meaning if you were to push any harder, then it would be difficult to hold that conversation. Then you'd be in zone three and then zone three, four, five as I understand them are little bit vague. But maybe you could give us a sense of the breathing patterns associated with each of the zones so that people could map to those when we discuss zone one through five. And as I say all this, I certainly tip my hat to all of those people out there who like to measure percent of maximum heart rate. They like to use heart rate monitors, they're using any number of different devices. I sometimes use those devices, but in general, I tend not to and I use my breathing as a rough guide of which zone I'm in. So before we go back to specific protocols for interrobit capacity, tell me how you think about zone one through five and how people might be able to assess whether or not they are in zone one, two, three or four or five. Great. So zone five is that absolute top thing and we can flag ourselves there. I like how you flag one and two. The distinction between three, four and five I'm less concerned with either. We will do some heart rate stuff, but not to identify what zone one, the fact is the distinction between those zones is basically just made up, not that it's fake, but there's no like rationale there. It's a little bit perceived effort and weightlifting. Are you at 100% output or 70% you know when you're at zero and you know when you're at 100 in that moment, but the difference between 60 and 70 is anybody's guess. Totally. So we use or the relevance, right? So why is it matter from at 60 or 70? Is there actually your difference? There's not. Right. So it doesn't really matter at that regard. If you're a very highly trained, particularly cyclist, things like that, then you can control a lot of circumstances. Those things start to make a lot more sense. But when you're in an open environment like the athletes ideal with, it's just not going to, it's not going to matter that much. So the way that I approach this is, and I will use this word intentionally stolen directly from Brian McKenzie and his company shift adapt. They use what's called a gear system and I absolutely love it. It's what we've been using for a long time. So with Brian with your permission, I'm going to take it right now. Thank you Brian, give me the permission to do that. Brian, Brian's a good friend of of ours. And I do think the, the breathing gear system is a terrific way to think about the zones and to get a good sense of what zone, what happens to be. Yeah. Great. So the first gear is your ability to simply breathe in and out through your nose at a set cadence. So basically, regardless of how hard you're working, can you restrict your breathing to like a two to three second inhale? And then I chew to three second exhale. And this is really clever actually because a lot of folks will jump immediately into an over breathing strategy. It was meant to be ventilating more than you need, which actually sends that RER up higher than it needs to be, which kicks you higher into carbohydrate utilization. If you're supposed to be in quote unquote zone one, you're trying to be efficient, not fast. So using more carbohydrates than you need is not beneficial here. You're walking for the day you're out on a longer hike. You're enjoying that you shouldn't be trying to ramp up carbohydrate metabolism. It should be efficient. And so this would be getting to an argument with somebody while on a long walk. You feel exhausted afterwards. You're going to over breathing. Yeah, totally. Right. So you should be able to breathe that at a specific cadence and generally people are doing that more frequently than 90. Right. Zone two, rather gear two, is inhaling and exhaling at whatever rate you need to be, but still nasal only. So it is a force. Right. Whatever you need to do, but your mouth is closing in time. You shifted higher up. You're burning more and more carbohydrate as a fuel source. But you're still able to control that and restrict it with nasal breathing. Now gear three and four, which is our final ones. There's no gear five. Gear three and four is like a subtle instruction. I actually don't even care about the difference. There I basically use gear one two and then that's four. But you're basically talking about either a nose to mouth strategy or a straight up mouth mouth. Right. So breathing into the nose out through the mouth. If you can control it that way, you can know the opposite actually. Right. Can you breathe in and out through your nose. But the classic one people do is into the nose out there the mouth. Again, I really didn't even care about this distinction. I basically jump from two to four. A Brian may do it differently. I don't actually know. Four is just mouth mouth. Right. And this is the case in most sporting applications. You're going to be breathing because the nose is restricted. Right. There's only so much space. And as we talked about earlier, the consequences of not having enough oxygen in or CO2 acceleration. If you're restricting that, this is going to be problematic. So in your actual competition, please go to the mouth if you need to. Right. We practice a lot trying to stay nasal only for as long as possible. But that's going to happen. When you're doing your high intensity intervals and you're really going as hard as you can, you're going to have to go to your mouth. Unless you're an absolute free causoid and you can say in your nose, but that's not going to happen. Right. Most people can't get past say 70 or 80 percent while breathing through your nose. I know somebody wouldn't get higher. But that's the general distinction. So we pay much more attention to those particular gears than we do heart rate zones. And zone five would be just pure mouth breathing all out. Right. Right. Here's your life. The gear system is just one to four. There's no fifth gear. Got it. So the gear four would again be mouth mouth. Breathing as much in as you can. Breathing as much as you can. Got it. And I appreciate your description of the gear system and how it roughly relates to the zones we've been talking about. Also, and reminded, if anyone wants to experience the relationship between breathing and the offloading of carbon dioxide and your ability to exert effort in anything, a game that a friend of mine sometimes likes to play when we walk or jog and talk as he'll say, let's just hold our breath now until we hit that piling or that lifeguard stand on the beach. And within seconds, you actually can start to panic. Also, it becomes very hard to coordinate your action after a little while. Again, be really careful with this. But it will teach you in a moment in a very real world way how important it is to be able to offload carbon dioxide because you're probably not running out of oxygen at those lower intensities. No questions. You're simply building up carbon dioxide and that gas brief like is screaming to go off and you're actively suppressing it. Yeah. So the interesting test here is your CO2 tolerance. On Ryan's website, you can go directly there. You can there's a video to how to run this test. And then you can put in your numbers and it'll tell you sort of exactly what to do as a result of it. But the CO2 tolerance is a test of exactly what you just mentioned. So you should be fairly tolerant. In other words, non-reactive. You can be responsive, but non-reactive. Two elevations in CO2. So you should see them and feel them, but you should be choosing how you respond rather than an reaction. There are interesting data looking at things like out of the blue panic attacks. You can actually notice those in blood via rises in CO2 up to 45 minutes prior to the event to app happening. So there are signals happening in your body that you may be sensitive or not sensitive to. The more in tune you can get with that, the better your life is going to be. And even if we're specifically just talking about exercise performance. So it's okay for CO2 to rise. It's going to rise. It's a bi-product of anaerobic anaerobic metabolism. It's a bi-product of carbohydrate and fat metabolism as we've established. It's going to get there. You're going to feel that. However, if you immediately go into a panic because of a small increase in CO2, this is a problem. So we're turning to anaerobic capacity this morning. We were training not together. I couldn't keep up with your workout, but I, but in the same general space, and I did my once a week maximum heart rate, one minute sprint on the assault bike. Sometimes I'll do more minutes, meaning I will do one minute than take some rest and do another minute after some rest. But I decided to do that one minute with you there, so I could learn from you. And indeed, I have to assume that that was largely within the anaerobic capacity realm. The first 30 seconds are so we're manageable. We're getting more and more painful. There was a quit signal going off in my head. You said there's real magic that occurs around second 40 and indeed somewhere around second 40 for whatever reason that seemed easier. But at the one minute mark, I was happy to stop because I was really at at least what felt to me 100% out. But is that a good protocol for building up anaerobic capacity? Keeping in mind what you said before, which is that specificity or precision, as you've raised it, is important. That is, if I wanted to train anaerobic capacity for sprinting, I probably should have been sprinting. Cycling, I was only a salt bike and so on. How many of those one minute all out? Sprints or 30 seconds all out sprints on the bike? Could and should one perform? Per workout and per week. So marching through exercise choice. Yep, let's do it. Order, volume, frequency and progression. Yep. Choices of exercise is trained for what you want to improve. Is that right? Not necessarily. So in this particular case, if you have a specific goal, yes, of course, do it. Exercise choice. A couple of things you want to look for. You want to pick something that you feel extremely confident in the movement with because you're going to forget your brain very quickly here because you're going to go into our pain cave. Okay. So if you're not comfortable running, don't go run here. You're never going to get this spot we need to get to it. If you're not comfortable, or if every time you go on a row or your low back hurts the next day, don't do it. If you're not comfortable using kettlebell swing, it's like you get the point. Don't do an exercise you're not comfortable. You also, secondly, want to be careful, a cautious of heavy eccentric loads, because you're going to be doing a lot of repetitions in a high intensity. So this is where I love an assault bike. This is where a roar is great. Swimming is amazing. Running uphill, generally more favorable than running on normal, ground, especially if you're not runner. Don't run downhill. That's a lot of eccentric load. I don't love things like box jumps here. Right? Because again, a lot of eccentric loading, if it's supposed you can jump up, line to the box step down. But now you're, again, you're too many things are going to your mind. I don't want to slip and fall. I want to smash my shin on the box. What happens if I'm too many variables? Pick something that is safer where you can really focus on your breathing and your posture and the performance. That's exercise choice. Then within that, if there's some specific thing you want to get better at, go ahead and do it. How many different movements, meaning should I do the assault bike and then some form of safe, executable overhead pressing? It's a little harder to imagine, anaerobic capacity for the upper body unless you have access to a skier or one of these, what are those things called the climber and machine? Yeah, the versiclimber. The versiclimber. That's the one, the versiclimber. You can tell how often I do that one. It's a great piece of extra guy's equipment. Yeah, so how many, how many exercises and what order is it going to be two or three exercises since you're involving a lot of muscle groups to complete? Yeah, that's a really generally these are going to be total body movements. So you can do something like a skier or if you want to really isolate your upper body, great love that. You can do lower body isolation like cycling. Right, we're going to provide some kind of valve. You can use weights here. You can do some barbell movements and stuff like that. They're just not my favorite choices for most people. Too many complexity things going on. So I generally am going to pick total body movements, pushing a sled, dragging a sled, sprinting up, hill, swimming. These things like that are going to be good. I'm seeing now why the assault bike is such a powerful tool because you're using your arms with some degree of resistance, but not a lot of eccentric load plus legs, some resistance, not a lot of eccentric load and yet one can go, quote unquote, all out for 30 to 60 seconds. Yep, and then the consequences of a technical breakdown are minimal. It's more like you're going to actually have a worse performance rather than an injury rate. So they're just a wonderful invention because of that. Where other things, the consequences, like say if you're going to be doing a barbell or kettlebell activity, the consequences of making a technical mistake, you might actually get an acute injury right there. So they're just a little bit higher in the risk scale. How many sets or sometimes referred to as repeats? Yep. So how many 30 to 60 seconds all out, sprints, again, doesn't have to be running, sprinting, but all out effort would be the better way to phrase it. Should I perform? Let's say per week. And then decide whether or not we can divide those up across multiple workouts or whether or not it's better to do them in the same workout. Yeah. If you're staying with the same exercise for all of your workouts, that's a little bit different answer than if you're modifying them. So say you're going to do this three times a week and you're going to do an air bike one day, you're going to do some hill sprints another day and then you're going to do some swimming another day. For sake of example, I'm going to say same movement because I think most people are going to be most comfortable with one or two types of movements unless they are really coordinated or an excellent athlete. I think most people can probably find a hill that they could run up and an airdine or a salt bike a rower, things of that sort. Yep. You're going to have a pro and a cone here. So the pro of doing less sets is you can actually train much closer to truly 100%. The downside is volumes low. So a major mistake people make here is they'll do something like I'll do 20 seconds on 10 seconds off. And I'll do that for 40 rounds. You're not really actually going that hard at those 20 seconds. So a key, in fact, if you look at the literature and all the positive benefits of high-intensity neutral training, that assumes you are actually hitting very close to 100%. If you're sliding down into like again moderate training stuff, you start to actually being a spot where you're not getting the total high-end stuff, but you're not doing it long enough to get the low-end stuff either. And so you end up in this like you've earned some calories. You probably still enhanced my little counter-abile dentists and little bit of capitalization, but you didn't really justify only doing three rounds. That's where the problem comes in. So in terms of a couple of protocols, I'll give you a how many sets per week. It's really hard to give a number unlike the strength training stuff where it was easy to kind of land some stuff on. A typical thing you'll see is like a minimum of 10 to be something like four rounds per day, three times per week. Wow, that's a lot. So my once a week all out effort of sprinting on the assault bike, the so-called airdine bike, for 60 seconds, one to three rounds of that, might be doing something useful for me, but I should probably be doing that two or three times a week. If you're going to get to a max heart rate, I'd generally like to say give me a minimum of one day a week, two, spetter, days per week, how many rounds? Whatever it takes you to get to that maximum heart rate, right? So in your case, you did one minute. Okay, good. If you're going to extend past a minute or two, one round might be enough. So for example, if you want to just do something where I'm going to run a mile as fast as I can, that's all you need to do for the day. You don't need to do multiple, you can do mile repeats if you'd like, but that is really, really challenging. I know we've extended the time duration here, but I wanted to go there to show you the time to make matters here. If you're doing something like a 22nd burst, you're going to need more rounds. If you're doing something longer like multiple minutes, you don't need as many rounds to get there. So in addition, if you're really reaching past this 90 seconds of hell window, it's just going to do a lot more damage to the system. Not damage is in bad, but it's in there's a lot to recover here. So we need more recovery time from that. A 22nd burst doesn't really challenge you. Challenges in that 22nd ship, but you'll be recovered in fine. A three minute thing is going to hurt and it's going to hurt for many, many, many minutes after that. And you're going to still see maybe some performance documents the next day, depending on what your recovery stuff looks like. So a couple of things to pay play with would be something like this. If you want to try like a classic 30 seconds on 32nd soft protocol, the literature will show like a minimum of four rounds of that probably three days a week. So 30 seconds all out, 30 seconds rest is one round. Repeat that four times at least once a week. At least two would be better. Great. Right? If you want to go something a lot longer than that, you might be able to get away with one. But generally two days a week of this is better. If you start actually pushing past like three to four days a week up to five or six, you may actually be causing some problems. There's just a little bit of excess fatigue that's going to happen there that you might be want to stay away from. In fact, you can see a lot of endocrineological problems and some other sleep issues and some other things kick in. And we'll talk about more of those things later. But that's the number to get with. If you want to try something more like a 22nd burst, I actually would recommend giving yourself more rest. So you can actually do a higher rest than work ratio. Most people tend to think of this is doing like one to one, 20 seconds on 20 seconds off or lower. I love doing like 20 seconds on 40 seconds off. The quality of that 20 seconds becomes extraordinarily high and it's also possible to now get like six to eight rounds. So as I'm hearing this, I'm going to wage your an offer. To you and if you say okay, then to to those listening, based on what you're telling me about the relationship between intensity and quality and the need for sufficient duration of this anaerobic work, how is five to six minutes per week of all outwork? That's pretty good. So what that means for me is I would do three all out one minute sprints on one workout separated by a minute or two. Maybe more. And I would do that two or three times per week. Just trying to hit that five or six minute per week threshold. Yep. Actually, I think one of the Marty Gabala is the scientist, Canadian guy, amazing work who's done a lot of the research on high intensity and we'll stop. I think the number he actually threw out there in some of his original research was comparing six total minutes of work to upwards of like 180 minutes of work throughout the entire week. And then one of the classic studies was looking at Vio to Max improvements and he saw equal if not greater improvements of Vio to Max with that. So I think actually the name of his book might be like this six minute workout or something. And so you like may have nailed that directly on the head. Purely by luck. But actually by also maybe wrong. The number we should probably fact check that. Yeah. Well, and also by inference from what you were saying, you know, if you're going to do this 20 seconds on for a second soft and you're doing more rounds or one minute all out. So the way I'm going to think about this if it's okay with you is for five to six minutes a week. I am sprinting for my life correct. But I'm sprinting for my life with good form in whatever movement I happen to be doing. And I can do all of that in one workout. But I'm separating out about of 20 seconds all the way up to one minute. Yep. By the necessary rest in order to recover my breathing. Get back to pure nasal breathing maybe zone one zone totally and then hit it again. If you're going to do the one minute thing like you do, I actually generally encourage one to three minutes of rest before you do the next round and probably up to four to six rounds. That would be your six minute number there. Now the caveat there is we don't worry about heart rate recovery. We worry about exactly what you mentioned, which is nasal only recovery. Once you can get back to that, give yourself another 30 seconds or so. And then you're ready to go for round two. This is where it gets fun because I can imagine challenging myself to get on the assault bike for one minute of kind of warm up very low intensity each morning and then sprint for a minute and then head off into my daily routine. No. Okay. That if you're going to do that, though, you need to give me three minutes of nasal only breathing before you go back to work. We need to downstriking that. And there are people in my life that would love for me to engage in more nasal breathing because it will have me speaking less. So no problem. Chances are I'm going to use the two or three workouts per week of one minute all maybe I'll try the shorter protocol. Can I give you one fun protocol to try here? Please. So if you have a you can use this on any equipment. But I learned this from another mutual friend, Kenny Kane. This is a great little it's a little test, a little a little game you can play with yourself. And there's only way to play this game is you're going to lose, which is really, really lovely. So you can do this at any door, you can do this for any duration of time, but two minutes is a good number. Okay. So you have to do this in some way where you can know distance. So this could be running cycling the airbikes what I use. The first two minutes you're going to cover as much distance as you can possibly cover in two minutes. And you're going to note that. So let's say you covered 400 meters. All right. Okay. Great. You're going to rest for two minutes. Amazing. That next round you're now going to go for distance. So you're going to cover the exact same amount of distance you covered in round one, which in this example was 400 meters. And it doesn't matter how long it takes you. It may take you two minutes and five seconds, two minutes and ten seconds, because you're a little bit fatigued from round one. Round three you're going to come back and do that exact same time domain that you did around two. So if it took you two minutes in five seconds and around two, now round three is going to last two minutes and five seconds. And you want to see if you can cover a greater distance. 405 meters, four hundred and ten meters. Then you did around one. And the beauty of this little protocol, six minutes total of work, right? But if you slack in one of the rounds, you just make the next round harder. Is there any rest between rounds? Yeah, two minutes. Always two minutes rest. You don't have to, but this would be my recommendation. Kenny Kane came up with us. I don't know if he came up with it. He taught me this thing. We both know Kenny and he's an incredibly nice and incredibly skilled trainer. I'm going to call it the sugar cane. Yeah, it's so great because it sounds really painful. And if you go out too hard and round one, you're in such big trouble round two. But if you go too easy and round one, you're going to get absolutely obliterated in round three. So it's like a wonderful thing. And you can pick that number as a standardization and then just try to improve that a little bit for a week. So progression is the last part of this whole thing that we haven't got to yet before we move on. And the way you want to progress all of these things is you can time stamp again how much work you can do and then this try to do a slightly higher amount of work, five percent or so every week or you can add around. Which is a really nice way. So in the in the research studies that have been done, they're going to do things like week one, you'll do three rounds. We two, you'll do four rounds, three, you'll go five rounds. You'll like add around and tell you get up to say six or seven or eight rounds at the end of the protocol. So that's a really nice way to go about it. Or you can cap the rounds and just try to get more work done in that same amount of time. Meaning go more intensely. Correct. You know, get further distance in your 30 seconds or your 45 seconds or whatever. I want to encourage people to go as low as 20 seconds. That's going to allow you to go very, very, very fast. That's going to actually challenge that fast for creating peace a little bit. I want to encourage people to also go as high as 90 seconds. So the honest way the way that I will do it, not that it's about me. But just as an example of something you could do, I do something in the 15, the 22nd burst range and I will generally hedge towards a two, two, one rest to work ratio. So I'm probably going to rest 40 to 60 seconds. That's sure that that's to make sure that 20 second burst is extremely high quality. Cool. I'm also going to do something in the 30 to 50 second range. Okay. I might go one to one work rest ratio. The quality of those 30 seconds is going to come down. But the acid buffering is going to be extraordinarily challenged. I'll also will do that with a triple or quadruple rest range. So again, 30 seconds on, maybe two minutes off. Now, I won't be able to be, I won't be working on my ability to handle the waste product build up there. But I'll be working on my ability to produce more force over that time, which is another skill set. And then all of the way up to say what you do a minute, 70 seconds. And you can go one to one there or up to three to one. You're going to be working a little bit of a different thing. But that's exactly how we hit both sides of this equation, working on dealing with waste as well as actually working on bringing in nutrients and getting that system a little bit more effective. So you can set that up across your week. And just it can be something like day one is that 22nd burst window. Day two is that maybe 60 second window. And then day three is maybe one all out effort. And we're done there. Let's talk about the specific protocols and adaptations related to maximum aerobic output or maximum aerobic capacity is that sometimes called sure. Now we're moving past like that couple of minute range into like the five to 15-minute range, but at a maximum intensity. So it's the highest you can go from there. We're not talking about our last category of long duration here. Well the beautiful part is we've already explained a lot of it because it's very similar to what we just talked about with anaerobic capacity. It is primarily going to be a problem. I'm dealing with waste products, especially at the end. It's not enough total distance to be running out of muscle like a gen though it may start to creep down a little bit. That's not going to be an issue. But certainly more oxygen transportation is going to be an issue. So we're just hedging a little bit more towards that side of the equation. Towards the end of that workout, no doubt about it clearing out waste products. This is going to be a huge issue. But really oxygen demand delivery is starting to take more of a prominent role because we have had more time to clearly waste. And if we're not good at that we're going to be failing earlier than we need. So the training for that needs to be a little bit at that exact same. So a classic thing here is a one mile test. This is going to last for most people somewhere between five and 10 minutes. You're sort of right in this window. If you just want to practice that once a week, we're done here. Exercise choice. Same thing we talked about. Pick an exercise you're comfortable with that you can actually do and you can progressively increase in terms of the intensity. You're not going to have to stop and change your exercise and I can't even move around. Like a circuit isn't great here because you've got to put one implement down pick up another one. You want to be doing something whether it's literally not a second of off switch. So similar exercise choice principles we just covered. If you go to become a real savage and you want to do repeats here, you can. And during folks we'll do that a lot one mile repeats. 800 minute your repeats, things like that, or I'm not sure what the swimming distance equivalent would be, but swimmers we do this constantly. But you don't need to. This is really hard. It's pretty hard in the system. It's very good for you. One to twice a week of hitting this. I think you'll be in a really, really good spot. Frequency we sort of just covered. We covered exercise choice. Volume me just sort of nailed and intensity is basically running you up to the top there. Now because you can only do that so often, you want to add in another 40 or so percent of your time being lower intensity support work for that. So this is something probably less than 85 percent of your heart rate, but higher than quote unquote zone two. You got to be working here. This is not I could have a conversation pace. This is higher than that. It's in between conversation pace and the pace I need to be at to run my fastest mile I've ever done. That's that middle ground and you need to train that so that you can continue to work on capitalization, oxygen transportation, but you're not burning down the house getting all the up to 100, 100 plus percent of your meal to max. Could I use a crude version of this where I say, okay, I'm going to exercise for 10 minutes. I'm going to go as fast as I safely can. And every week I'm going to measure how far I travel. Yep, he's in that 10 minutes. Love it. Probably not on the same day that I'm doing the anaerobic capacity work. Probably not. If you're probably okay to do after a strength training or high-purchary work out as long as I didn't train legs, you could. It's probably going to compromise recovery. Is the way. So I would if you're going to do a session like this, I would probably do it on its own day. Unless you wanted to do something like speed or power, then you could roll right into this and have no problem. Maybe a strength day, a hyper-chv day. I'm not sure you would do there because again, especially if you didn't sort of lower body exercise, you're going to be compromised here. But remember, these tend to be full body movements. So even if you did arms that day, your arms are going to be compromised and you don't want to fail this because of local muscular failure. All right, so now I've got my work cut out for me. I'm going to be doing five to six minutes per week of all out work divided into 60, 20 to 60 seconds, bounce with sufficient rest. And I'm going to give myself 10 minutes a week of, in my case, it'll probably be running as fast as I can because I do enjoy running and I can do it safely. Maybe uphill and see how far I go. Yep, if you want to combine the two, so if you're just saying, hey, I'm bought in Andy, like I want to do both of these things. They are similar, but they have independent benefits. I'm convinced how would I build these into the same week? Maybe do one of each. That still gets you at, quote, in two days per week, where you're going to hit a hot maximum heart rate. So we already checked that box up. So one day can be a shorter length interval repeat one. And the other one can simply be a five to 15 minute maximum work and you're done. Long duration endurance exercise. The stereotypical endurance exercise. Sure. How far, how long, how fast or how slow, rather should I go? And here, I'm going to venture that exercise choice is one that we could click off even at this point in the discussion because obviously it's got to be something that I can do for a long while without getting injured overuse injuries. There's a little bit of novelty we can actually throw in here. So one of the things I love to do for long duration endurance for people who don't love running cycling or swimming is you can do the really cool workout, any number of things where you can put a little circuit together. As long as there's not a lot of downtime between one circuit to the next time, you can actually do something as simple as like maybe you're going to do farmers carry. And you'll do that for say three minutes. And you'll set those down and you'll go straight into a plank for a minute. And you'll pick that up and you go straight into maybe bodyweight squats for two minutes. Then you go straight into another exercise and you can sort of rotate things around. Maybe you can do even some like shadow boxing stuff or some jump rope. You can do different gymnastics movements and bodyweight movements. And you can run that thing through and you can basically get the exact same thing accomplished and not feel like you're doing oh my gosh this mind numbing type of training if it feels like that to you. Another way you can do that to actually even simplify it even more. We've done this at Kenny Cain's Jam plenty of times where you just maybe even pick three machines. So you're going to go I'm going to go 10 minutes on the rover and I'm going to go 10 minutes on the treadmill and I'm going to go 10 minutes on the bike. You can actually knock a 30 minute quote unquote steady state session out in and not feel those problems if those things happens. So you can actually have a lot of fun there. We will do a lot of times with our fighters will do things like put a very low load. I'm talking sub 50% of your max on a barbell and you're going to squat and you're going to do you know maybe a minute you're going to put that down and then you're going to go over and do 50% of a bench press. You're going to put that down you're going to go over and do 50% of a of a crab block and then you're going to go over and do another one and you can actually run through this entire thing. You don't hit that many reps in any individual movement the load is very very light and you can keep heart rate, basically a steady state and do 15 or 20 or 30 different exercises. And it's actually like fairly fun and engaging to do and it's a little bit more specific than trying to give a 275 pound NFL player to run for 30 minutes which is not going to be good. So I'm just chuckling because I love to run outdoors and I've enjoyed runs on all my travels and I find it to be a great way to see different places. I like moving through space but there are weather conditions and times when that's not an option so what you described is a terrific alternative. I have to assume that the specific adaptation that's occurring here is related to the fat burning system and again that doesn't necessarily mean fat loss correct we're all but fat burning system and yet I do have a question which is can you build enhanced microcapillary systems into the muscles by doing this long duration cardio. Yeah absolutely can in fact depending on which paper you like more than the other papers you may even find evidence that this is a superior method than anything else. So steady state endurance is very important. I used to not like it as much. There's just so much evidence now that suggests it's probably a really good thing for basically everybody. Maybe for some individuals it's not in all year of their training but if you're not a high level athlete or have a very specific goal that's right in front of you it's probably best to do at least 20 minutes as a minimum maybe 30 minutes of some steady state exercise once a week for basically any training goal outside of again a couple of really specific scenarios that are happening. The other thing that kind of kicks in here that we haven't really talked about is now we're actually reaching a position where fatigue of the inner cost those starts to play. So diaphragmic fatigue starts to run in education so we forget generally breathing is a contraction to open up the lungs to change pressure so the air will flow in and then the acceleration is passive right it's just a muscles been stretched it goes back to it's resting. When you get to a maximum heart rate inhalation and an acceleration become active so your squeezing is hard to get to open up in your squeezing to contract the blow air out. You're going to get fatigued that system right over time you have contracted contracted open up if that system starts to get fatigued you start running into failure here so you need to practice that and this is when all kinds of things like breathing drills to just simply training in this fashion there's all kinds of exercise devices for your lungs and when we say that that's what we're really talking about the musculature around the lungs needs to not fatigue so that's the only other little component I wanted to throw in here if we're not talking about acid buffering which in this particular case is not a problem anymore. The time domain is long and slower so we have plenty of time to use fat as a fuel we also have plenty of time to use anaerobic anaerobic like causes and clear out waste products so we don't really see pH being a problem with this type of exercise you may start running low on liver glycogen if you're going a very long time muscle glycogen may start getting low but not really these for huge issues you're going to run into maybe a little bit of stroke volume issue but an intensities not high enough to become a problem you're more likely to break down posturally or breathing mechanics than really anything else unless again that duration really gets generally passed two hours for most people so those are the things that are going to limit us so how do we improve it what do we train we went through the exercise choices you also need to make sure you're training your inner costals we need to be training our diaphragm in some fashion again it can be the exercise itself can be your normal training the thing you need to be careful of here and this is actually true for all the things we just talked about when we think about fatigue and we think about failure and endurance we really need to pay attention to technical breakdown that is always the marker we look for so when we when we go through our stuff with our athletes and they quote unquote fail are they finish that's generally because we saw a massive technical breakdown you're done like you're over there not always the case during all your round of the training but this is something to really pay attention to so if you're on that bike and your 40 seconds in and all of a sudden posture serves to crunching over I may stop the test I may stop the training it's like no well we decided failure was is when you lost your technique to some sufficient level so you want to pay attention to that too because that's going to determine your ability to perform well as well as maintain efficiency which is a really big problem here tell me if the protocol I'm about to describe would be a reasonable one for people to incorporate 60 to 120 minutes of long duration work per week so one way to accomplish that I often use is to head out for a weight vested hike it's not a heavy weight vest it's maybe I think it's eight or ten pounds one of these thinner ones and if people don't have access to that you know backpack with some items in it I mean it can be a similar one you can just be your body okay great and and do some hiking at a fast enough clip that breathing harder than I would be if I just kind of shuffle to long yeah I might stop here there during some water no big deal but I can carry on a conversation if I need to so it's a zone two-ish but probably pushing a little bit harder than that for that duration yeah not a lot of deep soreness occurring after this maybe a little bit of achiness and some stabilization muscles that were used that may not be used too much especially if I've been sitting a lot during the week kind of reminds me of how much I've been sitting yep but doing that all in one long afternoon typically on a weekend or doing two shorter sessions throughout the week maybe 45 minutes and 45 minutes and then working up the progression to longer longer duration seems like that would be something that most people should be able to do yep and that it would weave in well with any resistance training or the anaerobic and a aerobic output capacity work that we talked about just a moment ago great that's a fine version to do it if you want to go shorter and ring up the intensity a little bit so you want to keep it more to the 30 to 60 minute range and go you know closer into the I can't have a conversation right now but again I'm not at a blistering heart rate and then you could probably get that same thing done in a smaller time window if that was a consideration so if you wanted to blend all three of these together you have a lot of wiggle room right so you could do something like order if we're talking about this type of training you could do this first and then to finish with either one of the higher intensity stuff we talked about so it could be roped into the same thing it could be its own independent day could be your sort of active recovery day tends to be fairly restorative as you alluded to a little bit there so it's not that big of a deal to do this on your quote unquote off day if you're if you're that type of person who like even on your off that you have to do something physical this is fine right if you wanted to do it on a lifting day especially if it's a power strength they it's probably fine if you wanted to do it before the workout or after it either way you're probably okay probably best to do it after if the primary goal is one of the strength training adaptations if it's not if this is a primary goal do it first amazing if you wanted to do it in the combination with the other interval stuff you could do it fine there you could do it before or you could do it afterwards I actually have no problem doing it afterwards because that in effect especially if you say nasal only during this training will help the down regulation go and so you could finish that fairly well down regulated actually so it's kind of like a nice way to get thoroughly warmed up go really really hard and then give it a nice 20 to 30 minute slow back down and by the time you finish maybe even on a three minute lock nice slow nasal breathe for second inhale four second inhale maybe five see play with the numbers a little bit then maybe you don't even need to do the down regulation breathing out where you jump in a good spot well you wouldn't want to do this before do your intervals finish your intervals throw up land the ground sweat all over the gym floor get up and go back to work that's probably on our best strategy as people are hearing this all they may be thinking wow this is a lot of work to do but I've been keeping track of the math here some sure some you out there are as well and we're really talking about 10 minutes of the of running or sprinting on the bike or rower once a week we're talking about six minutes or so of the much higher intensity but short bouts divide into rounds of 20 to 20 seconds to a minute with with rest in between and then some longer duration work out of 30 minutes minimum but maybe as much as an hour even two hours which in total doesn't really equate to that much time especially if one can access these things right out there front door or at home and as we point out you don't need any specialized equipment to do that oh and I forgot the muscular endurance that wasn't trying to cheat there the some muscular endurance thrown in as well so that brings me to a question which is if I'm doing my training for muscular endurance each week for anaerobic capacity and for maximum aerobic output and long duration and given that all of that can take roughly two hours for the typical person total for the entire week which I would argue is going to give you back so much life literally in terms of longevity you're literally going to earn back years of your life productivity in the same way off setting all sorts of metabolic issues and enhancing your sleep and improving mood and there's so much data so much data pointing to all those positive benefits if I do all of these things and I'm fairly consistent about them am I going to be metabolically flexible am I going to have a well-developed fat burning carbohydrate burning system and will I be essentially fit I mean this is not leaving aside issues of strength and hypertrophy which were covered in the previous episode will I be fit I mean to my mind the ability to you know sprint very fast if one needs to the ability to go longer duration if one needs to and the ability to do something in between as well as you know hold a box overhead if necessary I'm well installing a shelf or something like that these are the realities of life and to me represent real functional world fitness if that's the case is there anything that we would want to add to this program or would you consider that a fairly comprehensive and complete endurance training system if we remember the target which is I want to have energy I want to look a certain way and you want to be able to do that for the duration of your life for a very long life this style of training we incorporate all of those areas of endurance gives you all of the necessary adaptations one would need to execute all of those things remember fat loss or weight management is not best done with any individual style of protocol so if you do a little bit of all three of these you've checked that fat loss box you don't need to go on to anything separate for it you've done all the things then to cover aesthetics from that side of the equation right you've done the things to both enhance myocondria to enhance blood flow increase oxygenation and manage fatigue and waste development boom energies there fatigue is there I'm not going to get tired or have to quit or stop or sit down doing any exactivities I want at the same time if you look at the literature on mortality one of the strongest predictors of how long you're going to live is your VO2 max so we've set up a scenario in which you're going to hit all three of those primary goals by doing a combination of this training you're not going to miss any plausible adaptation from endurance training and you should be set for regardless of your goal dreadable and as I understand totally compatible with strength and hypertrophy training provided that your goal is to also be strong and also selectively hypertrophy or generally hypertrophy your muscles or maintain your muscles for many people that are listening to this I'm guessing that they have an interest in building more endurance but not just the ability to go further but the ability to go a given distance at a higher speed and to do it with better form and to breathe better and to feel better before during and after for those folks maybe you could spell out a program that combines these different elements of endurance and does so in a way that informs how for instance the higher intensity short duration sprints would be expected to improve their longer duration work and how perhaps their longer duration work can progress if they are careful to include some planks and some wall sits and things of that sort I asked this question specifically because I have to believe that while they're probably or some folks out there they're looking to maximize their plank from week to week to week typically it seems that people fall into these categories of either one and get stronger and get bigger muscles to varying degrees or to get better at endurance or to get better at everything overall right now I'd really like to just focus on what you think is a nice contour of a program for the person that wants to get better at endurance but do it with more speed, more stability and just feel like a strong endurance runner, cyclist, swimmer or whatever happen to be their endurance event. Okay great so let's just give an example maybe you want to run your first half marathon something like that okay maybe done a couple times before but you just want to get better at that time I would probably put somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 70% of your you know mileage in the moderate intensity zone okay so you need to accumulate mileage and you need to be able to handle what we call the tissue tolerance so in this case your feet need to be able to handle 13 miles of pounding okay it doesn't matter how much high heart rate training you do or your fat deliverability none of that matters if your feet are blown up by mile eight okay so in addition we talked about how even training in that 70 to 85% heart rate zone is quite effective at oxygen delivery fat utilization capitalization etc so you're going to get a lot of direct endurance benefits from that work you're also going to be working on what's honestly going to be one of your limiting factors which is that tissue tolerance and that pounding okay in addition you need to be efficient with your technique and you need a lot of repetitions for motor scale development so you want to spend most of your time there it's easy to recover from it's not extremely demanding and challenging awesome that leaves you in another 30 or 40% of training I would spend 10% of that in that like 20 second burst area you're going to drive up fatigue extremely high and you're going to really maximize your ability to recover from waste production all right great I would spend the remaining amount of time either on a little bit of actually maximum speed stuff that could actually be in the 22nd burst if you're really trying to go as fast as you can at the beginning of that exercise and then the rest of it I would spend in that other zone which is more of like the five to 15 minutes but you're probably going to want to repeat those and this is when things like 800 meter run rest for double the time and then repeat that two or three times you actually need that in this scenario because you're going to need to be able to be running for two most people going to do a half marathon or maybe around two hours or so something like that and so you want a little bit of what we call repeated endurance right so be able to handle that higher or higher rate come back down do it again at the same time that's actually how you bump your mileage up so instead of having this do more of these long duration distance runs you can still get maybe five or six miles done in a day if you're going to do a one mile repeat or whatever number you're looking at so for a lot of people that's kind of how I would structure it that's honestly is very similar to what we laid out in the previous conversation which is getting this idea that more than 50% should be basically practice a little bit of work at the very top end of the spectrum but not too much and then a little bit of work at the other end and you should be in a good spot a major mistake one would make here is only doing the long duration steady state stuff and just sort of saying I'm going to run a five mile this was week and then do six miles next week and seven I said at my work for you is I think we have enough evidence at this point both in the scientific realm as well as most of the coaches I think in this space would agree with me is that's a sub optimal strategy so it could work but we can do better and in terms of the structure of a program like this I realize that those structures vary tremendously different coaches and different books and different programs are going to say oh you should run money through Friday with weekends off every other day but in terms of this 70% 30% divide worth 70% is going toward the specific event you know doing the kind of work that you're going to do during the specific event that you're most interested in cultivating or improving and the remaining 30% coming from other sorts of supporting work how should one thing about distributing that other 30% should it be all geared towards maximizing recovery for the 70% or in other words could I do all that 30% work on one day? I probably was split it into two days that's the reality so if you're thinking man coach wants me to train six days a week my schedule is tight I can pull off four to five okay great what I might say is two of those days are just your your tempo right this is what like a runner would call it's like tempo training kind of in that space or minus with tempo training is just for that it's like the 80% effort range where you're like running at probably the same stride length and rate that you're going to run your race at maybe a little bit lower but something similar you're practicing skill you're a crewing mileage and you're getting a little you're getting work and for sure work but it's not absolutely a fastest you can sprint that's also not conversation so this would be the what before we refer to as the 10 minutes of of fast running or 10 minutes of fast running this is lower intensity than that got it this is this is work accumulation got it this is practice stuff then one of the days week I would probably enter in that 22nd 32nd burst for a little bit of speed there and then one of the other days is when I would do that true high intensity as hard as I can for hitting a V02 max something like that so that's probably how I'd break it up if I had like four days a week if you had five you can maybe add in another day we do more of that volume accumulation practice work but that's a pretty good split well this is the point in the episode where I say thank you ever so much you provided an enormous amount of incredibly interesting clear information that's also actionable I do feel as if I far better understand endurance in its many forms and even the seller underpinnings of that and even sub-seller underpinnings of what endurance adaptations are and how to foster those through specific protocols things that not only I can do tomorrow but that I will do tomorrow and where I hit my pain points I'll understand what's happening and the adaptation that I'm triggering when my legs are burning or I'm sucking for air through my mouth or I can calmly move along just through nasal breathing I will now know what's happening in my body and the specific adaptations that I'm triggering I think you also highlight something that is vitally important and I've never heard it phrased as clearly as you did today which is that it really doesn't matter how one seeks out to achieve fat loss provided certain criteria are met even while certain forms of exercise tap into fat stores more than others and you beautifully illustrated the relationship between energy utilization and breathing and the fact that we literally exhale fat to some extent of course so once again thank you thank you and thank you I know I'm not alone in recognizing this information as incredibly interesting and actionable and indeed I do plan to put it in action as I hope many of our listeners will as well yet again the pleasure is actually all mine and I actually really appreciate the fact that you let me go so far in a metabolism my Ph.D. is in human by one of genetics so anytime I can go many hours in a metabolism I get very excited and I don't typically get that leash in this format so I appreciate that I know you understand your audience will love that hopefully oh they'll love it and I think that they'll especially love it because they understand that if one can wrap their head around even just a small fraction of the mechanisms that underlie given protocol it gives both tremendous depth and meaning to that protocol and makes it so much more flexible for people they can really think about what's happening as they're engaging in a given protocol and know exactly what they can expect in terms of results great we've been on a bit of a journey here we've covered a lot ground with speed development and strength and hypertrophy and now we walk through probably several hours here of endurance what I would love to do next is to just give you a more straightforward not as much background not as much metabolism none of the mechanisms right into protocols for someone who says look I want to hit those marks you keep talking about I want to look good I want to feel good and I want to do that across my lifespan how what I build all these things into a protocol that actually covers maybe the entire year and how would I be able to repeat that year after year so I almost have this evergreen sustainable year long periodization structure that covers all the nodes I need to if I want everything we've talked about in these nine adaptations in this short series so I would

vid00006," Welcome to the Human Lab guest series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and optymology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today marks the second episode in the sixth episode series with Dr. Andy Galpin, a professor of canesiology at Cal State University Fullerton and one of the foremost world's experts on the science and applications of methods to increase strength, hypertrophy, and endurance. Today's episode is all about how to increase strength, speed, and hypertrophy of muscles. Professor Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back. Last episode, you told us about the nine specific adaptations that exercise can induce everything from strength and hypertrophy to endurance, muscular endurance, so on and so forth. You gave us this incredible tool kit of fit tests for each of those adaptations so that people can assess them for themselves, and then of course improve on each and every one of them if they choose. By the way, people can access that information, simply going to the first episode in this series with you, and it's all there in timestamped, and I highly recommend people do that. Today we're talking about strength and hypertrophy, and so right out the gate, I just want to ask you, why should people think about and train for strength and hypertrophy? And that question is of course directed towards those that are trying to get stronger and grow bigger muscles, but I know that many people out there, perhaps, have not thought about the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training and how beneficial it can be, not just for people that want to get bigger biceps, et cetera, but that have other goals, longevity goals, and health goals unrelated to what most people associate with hypertrophy. So what are the benefits of training for strength and hypertrophy for the everyday person, for the athlete, for the recreational exercise or and so on? There's a wonderful saying, I think it was Bill Baum and the founder, one of the founders of Nike, and he always said, if you have a body, you're an athlete. And I think that's very important for people to understand, because one of the major services we've done in this field is convince people that things like strength training, are for athletes or for growing bigger muscles, and cardiovascular training are for things like fat loss and heart health. And that is a tremendous service because it puts a lot of unnecessary barriers, and leads to a lot of false assumptions, and therefore poor actions. And the last examples of this are people who are resistant to strength training because they don't want to put on too much muscle. People who only perform one type of exercise because they want to fat loss or they're in it for long, heavy and health, and they don't work, they're not worried about being an athlete. And so right out the gates, we can actually draw a back a little bit to what we were our previous conversation when I walked you through the history of the Vexualized Science. And that is to help you understand these are the real roads that you're running down and you don't even realize it. And in terms of everyone thinks of strength training, and they immediately default to our principles to optimize muscle growth. And that's not the only adaptation one should be after was strength training. When we think of endurance training, we immediately default to things like, again, cardiovascular health or fat loss or things like that. What I really want to do across this entire series and conversations is to just break that immediately. Talk about all the other things that you can do with your training. And so that people can be comfortable and confident in doing an optimal training program for whatever goal they have, whether that be specific like growing muscle or non-specific, like just feeling better, having more energy, being more prepared for life and longjewing. So to directly answer your question, I could really, we could do a hundred episodes on the benefits of exercise. And we could run all the way from mood and focus cognitive tasks to a better immune function. You'll get less cold, you'll fight them off, more effectively, to mortality. So some of the strongest predictors of how long and how well you will live are exercise. However, there are independent benefits that come from just endurance training and there are independent benefits that come from strength training. And so to just give you one categorically, the way that you want to think about this is resistance exercise and strength training is the number one tool to combat neuromuscular aging. You cannot get that through any other form of exercise besides heavy overload strength training. And we can walk through a detail what that is, but that is, reason number one, in general, human movement is a function of number one, some sort of neuromuscular activation. So nerves have to turn on. The second part is muscles have to contract and the third part is those muscles have to move a bone. All right, if you want to be alive and you want to live by yourself, you have to be able to engage in human movement. If you have any dysfunction in the neuromuscular system there, then you're not going to be able to do that. And again, as I mentioned, the only way to preserve that or fight that loss of aging is to strength strength. So people will tend to hear numbers like you lose about 1% of muscle size per year after age, about 40. And that's true. However, what they don't realize is you lose about 2 to 4% of your strength per year. The loss of strength is almost double that the loss of muscle mass of aging. Muscle power is more like 8% to 10% per year. And so we can very clearly see the problem you're going to have with aging is not going to be preservation of muscle, although that is incredibly important. It's going to be very specifically preservation of muscle power and strength. And why that really matters is your ability to again stand up and move. Your ability to catch yourself from a fall. Your ability to feel confident doing a movement. That is a function of muscle power more than it is muscle size. And so functionality is really what we want to be. Right? You want to be able to do whatever you want to do physically and feel confident doing that as you age. That's going to only be obtained through strength strength. So is it appropriate to say that training for strength and high-perchography is also a way to keep your nervous system healthy and young? Absolutely. It is the only exercise route we have for that. If you look at just basic numbers like motor units, you're going to see that older individuals have like a 30 to 40% reduction in total motor units. So when you say older approximately what ages are you referring to? Because I know many people out there such as myself are 40 and older, but I know many of our listeners are in their 20s, maybe even in their teams. And I can imagine that people that start doing strength and high-perchography training younger will afford themselves in advantage over time. But that everybody should be doing strength and high-perchography training for as much of their lifespan as possible. That's really the message that I'm getting. So if somebody is, for instance, 45 would that fall into the bin of older? You're going to start seeing decrements passed again around the age of 40 or so. There's a lot of genetic variation there and a lot of other things go into that equation like your sleep and your nutrition. But that's a fair number to sort of think about. One actually response is it's actually sort of counterintuitive. The wonderful thing about strength training is you don't actually have to start at a young age. You can actually, in fact, I was reading a paper this morning because of our previous conversation. It was in over age 90. So these are folks 90 plus and they saw improvements like 30 to 170% in things like muscle size and hypertrophy over a very short period of time. I think it was 12 weeks. So you don't actually have to start. There are some adaptations that you're going to need for health that you got. You really need to start in your 20s. The reason I like to mention that is because if you are listening and you are 50 and you're like, oh shit, I haven't been strength training. You're not toast. You should absolutely start now. But you're going to be able to get to a fantastic spot very quickly. Similarly though, if you are 20 or 25 and 30 and you aren't lifting, there are still many reasons why you should do that now. And I like to point that out because a lot of folks would be like, oh my gosh, they said I have to do it when I'm 20 or 25 or you know, I'll be so discreet. And that's not the case at all. There's really no age limit on the same fact. On the same fact, there's actually interesting data that just came out showing this reduction in muscle strength. And I purchased that I started talking about is basically a related with a preservation of activity. In other words, you don't lose these functionalities because of aging. You lose these because of a loss of training. To state that again, you don't lose these because of some innate physiological thing that happens with genes become less sensitive or you lose functionality. Pretty much can describe the loss of function of strength and muscle in aging as exclusively because of a loss of training and nutrition and anabolic resistance and some other things. So you can do a lot more than you think when it comes to maintaining high quality muscle. And that's really important to point out. I'm reminded of the words of the great sharing. He won the Nobel Prize. I guess the neuroscientist trying to claim him as a neuroscientist because he worked on the neurosystem, the physiologist claim as a physiologist. He is 100% a physiologist. I would call him a neuroscientist maybe we can argue about this later. But I think one of the key things that Sherington pointed out was that I believe the quote was that movement is the final common path. And what he was referring to is the fact that a significant fraction of the brain itself is devoted to our ability to move. And our ability to engage in resistance type movements and that resistance type movements and the continuation of movement throughout the lifespan is what keeps the brain young and healthy and vital. And there are so much data now to support that. But it's so grateful that you brought up early this fact that there's a neuromuscular link. Because I think a lot of people think about musculoskeletal. They forget that the nervous system is really in charge of the strength of the muscle contractions and the types of muscle contractions that occur. I'm certain we're going to get into that in a lot of depth today. You're close there. We're not totally right, but we're close. Okay. Well, I look forward to being corrected and to achieving the precision that you're known for around that discussion. So if we are to step back and say strength training and hypertrophy training is critical for people of all ages. Yeah. For developing and maintaining the neuromuscular system and for our ability to function in the world. Yeah. Not just offset injury, but the ability to pick things up and move, etc. What are some of the other things that strengthen hypertrophy training can provide? I know a lot of people use strengthen hypertrophy training for changing their aesthetics. What is your sense about its potency for changing aesthetics as compared to say cardiovascular exercise? Yeah. The mantra I always like is the reason you want to exercise is threefold. You want to look good, feel good, play good. That's really that comes from sport, comes from football, specifically we always say that. And what that means really is you want to look good. People want to look the way they want to look. Whatever that means to them and there are any versions of what you feel to be aesthetically pleasing and that's totally irrelevant. But people want to look the way they want to look. Number two, you want to be able to feel good. What's that mean? You want to be injury free. You want to have energy throughout the day. You want to go to execute anything you want to do so that you want to go surf in the morning. You want to pay a rack above. You want to hike. Are you want to do all three of those in one day? You should have the ability to do that. And then you want to play good, which means you should be able to execute any kind of activities that you want to execute whatever that means. All right. So backing all that. What's I got to do with your question? One of the major benefits of strength training is the responses tend to happen extremely fast. So you can see noticeable changes in muscle size certainly within a month. Absolutely within six weeks. And so we have this wonderful feedback loop that sort of tells you, Am I doing this incorrectly? Oh my gosh. Yes, I am also. It's very addicting. The feedback, the response, the physical changes. Whether this is actually 0.23, look at our feel good play good or it's even just part one. You're starting to see that when you compare that to things like fat loss, that journey tends to be longer. It's more difficult. It's more relying upon other factors like nutrition, etc. Strength training is really about like there's some very minimal nutrition requirements outside of that. It comes out of the training and the feedback is immediate. That's powerful because if you look across the literature on exercise adherence, you'll see that that is in fact the number one predictor of effect in this of any training program. So what that means is if you were to put any variable possible and figure out what is going to determine what an office program works. This is what we typically call the methods you're many in the concepts are few. So the methods of exercise, the methods of strength training, the methods of high-purchary training, which we'll talk about, are infinite. However, there are only a handful of key concepts that you have to achieve in order for that program to work. At hereins is one of them and again is often the top one. So you need to do something you need to do something consistently. When you are getting that feedback and you're seeing results in your appearance immediately and you see that every single day, every time you take off your shirt or every time you look in the mirror, you see that result. That tends to drive adherence really powerfully. It's important to give people in, especially people who are not maybe like you and I who are like, I'm going to lift weights and I'm going to exercise like no matter what the rest of my life, because I just love it. Not everyone's like that. And so giving them a little bit of a carrot of success and if you can achieve that in say 3 to 4 to 5 weeks already, it's very powerful to it. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from Dr. Galpons teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is, however, part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. And keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Momentus. Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentus for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations. With single ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, Momentus Supplement ship internationally. And this is, of course, important because we realized that many of the Huberman Lab podcasts listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the Huberman Lab podcast, in particular supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things, including exercise recovery.

Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've been using an 8 Sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I'm sleeping about the same amount, but I'm sleeping far deeper, and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so-called rapid eye movement or REM sleep and slow wave sleep. And waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically. The underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward. I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep at night, your body needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees in terms of core body temperature, and waking up involves a 1 to 3 degree increase in core body temperature. With 8 Sleep mattress covers, you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be 1 temperature at the start of the day. After at the start of the night, a different temperature, the middle of the night, and a different temperature as you approach morning. Each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep, and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever.

Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real time feedback on your blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor. Many people are aware that their blood sugar, that is their blood glucose level, is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body. Most people do not know how different foods and different activities, including exercise, or temperature environments impact their blood glucose levels. And yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things. I first started using levels about a year ago as to how different foods exercise and timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night impact my blood glucose levels. And I've learned a tremendous amount from using levels. It's taught me when best to eat, what best to eat, when best to exercise, how best to exercise and how to modulate my entire schedule from work to exercise and even my sleep. So if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying at continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link slash Huberman. That's a levels at dot link slash Huberman. Let's talk about strength and hypertrophy. If you would, please remind us what strength and hypertrophy are in terms of the specific adaptation they represent. What I mean by that is when somebody is training for strength, what are they really training for? Obviously it means the ability to move more weight, but I know that it includes a number of other things as well. And when one is training for hypertrophy for the growth of muscle fibers, what does that represent? Because I think if people understand that, they will far better understand the methods and protocols that are going to be best for strength and hypertrophy. At its core, you've basically described it. When we talk about strength, we're talking about an actual function. So can you create more force across a muscle or muscle groups or total movement? When we talk about hypertrophy, when we're specifically referring to just an increase in size, there's no actual mention of function. So a muscle can grow larger without actually technically being stronger for a number of reasons. However, there is a strong relationship between strength and hypertrophy. So a lot of the times in the general public in the lay conversations, we sort of lump those two things in as the same thing. And so we have to recognize people who are new to training or people even are intermedially trained. There is a huge overlap between strength and hypertrophy. Once you get past that, though, they become disentangled. And a good example of it is this. If you look at these strongest people in the world, this would be people who compete in the sport of power lifting. That's a true test of maximal strength. So it is a deadlift, a bench press, and a back squat. And you're going to do a one repetition max and all three of those. And so whoever wins is the person who lifted the most amount of weight one time. That's it. It's not like world strongest man where it is, how many reps can you do in a row or your time? Right? Is they true? Maximus strength test. And you compare those to say body builders. Now, both of those individuals are strong. And both of those individuals have a lot of muscle. However, it is extremely clear the power lifters will be significantly stronger than the body builders on average. Right? There are individual exceptions, but we're just talking collective averages. And the body builders will have more muscle than the other ones. In addition, whether you look at Olympic weightlifting, or power lifting, or world strongest man for that matter, there are weight classes. And the reason is, as you go up and weight classes, you will always see the world records go higher and higher and higher. Right? So you can clearly get stronger without adding any muscle. However, there's a point where you simply have to add more mass to get a higher number. And that's why we have weight classes in those sports and in combat sports and lots of other things. So we have that there's a lot of confusion, right? Because people think, man, either these are the same thing. Or if I want to get stronger, I have to get bigger, which is not the case at all. Another misnomer here is I can't get stronger unless I add muscle. That's not true either, right? This is similar idea. So what I'm saying is you have the ability to do whatever you'd like. If you'd like to get stronger and add muscle, great. If you add muscle, you're probably going to bring some strength along for the ride. However, if you want to get stronger and you don't want to add muscle for any reason, personal preference on aesthetics, whether you're in a weight class and you simply can't afford it, it is quite easy to get stronger and not add much muscle math either. And so differentiating these two things is one of them is simply a measure of size. And the other one is a measure of force. And when we talk about strength, we're really talking about our two unique components. Component one is what I call the physiology. So what is the ability of the neuromuscular system, what is the ability of the muscle fibers to contract and produce force? The other one is what we call mechanics. And mechanics is simply things like, it's Manusia down to how long your femurzar, relative to your tibia or other things. This is bomb mechanics. This is also technique. This is skill. This is how smooth you feel. This is, are you firing the right muscle group in the right sequence and order and all of these things plan to strengthen. So somebody who maybe has more force capability and their muscle fibers, but their technique and the movement is worse may lose in a competition or somebody, again, who's like, if you go into the world of speed and power, especially here, a lot of people talk about the rhythm. And there's this, this is certain rhythm that has to happen if you want to jump as high as possible or run as fast as possible. But that's all mechanics at this fundamental level. So when we look at hypertrophy, it's just still simply about how big the muscle is. So those are the similarities and distinctions between strength and hypertrophy. When strength improves and when hypertrophy increases, is there also involvement in the ligaments and tendons. That is, of course, the ligaments and tendons are involved in the movements. And yeah, but do ligaments and tendons themselves grow and or get stronger? This field is really difficult because connected tissue is not bascular. And so their plasticity is significantly lower than skeletal muscle. In fact, if you look across all the organs, skeletal muscle is one of if not the most plastic, meaning it's the most pliable, the most responsive. And when it's going to adjust, it's basically it's paying attention to everything that's being said in the body. You cannot change blood pressure or pH or macronutrients floating around without muscle knowing about it. It is, in fact, this is why we call muscle on organ. People don't tend to think about this if you were ever on like a jeopardy and ask you that question, like what's the biggest organ system in the body people tend to say the skin. Muscle is actually the correct answer. All right, well, I'm going to cite you when I get it. You'll probably get it wrong. I don't have any immediate plans to go to jeopardy, but who knows? Oh, there you go. Celebrity jeopardy. Hand you here, man. Wait, I don't know about the celebrity part, but jeopardy would be fun. Yeah. But I will say the muscle and I'll, if you get a phone call on jeopardy, I don't know. I haven't seen that show in a very long time. Maybe ever, then I'll call you, but that makes sense. The muscles would be the largest organ system in the body. Yeah. The reason I'm saying that is, so muscle is both listening and talking. It is controlling the immune system a lot. It's controlling blood glucose regulation. It is, it is the central depot for amino acids, which are needed to do things like regulate the immune system build any new red blood cells. A lot of this stuff is coming from skeletal muscle. So when we say organ by the way, that's actually like a physiological definition. So something that's communicating to either another organ itself or throughout the system. So it's listening and it's talking. Connected tissues out the same way. And so we do see adaptations with strength training in connected tissue. It's just much lower. It's difficult to measure. Effectively, what we know now is you're going to have a combination of adaptations throughout the connected tissue. It is beneficial. This is probably one of the major reasons that strength training reduces injury risk, which is very, very important because people who tend to want to pick up an exercise routine after say 10 years. The classic cliche is like I played all these things in high school. Then I went to college. Got a job. Now I'm 25 or 35 or whatever. You sort of want to jump back into what you did when you were 20. Well, there's no tissue tolerance left. And what we almost always mean by that is connective tissue. The tolerance in there is not ready for the load. You're about to handle. And so you go through some movement and then boom. Sprayings, tears. You know, even the more significant ones are on a keelies tear, which is going to really sideline you. So those are some of the problems. And we know strength training as a large role in injury reduction for stress and strain and overuse injuries. And that's specifically coming for the connected tissue adaptations. Again, the difficult part here is it's very hard to assess. We actually, when I was a doctor student, we played around with Patelah tendon biopsies. So I actually had one. This is like a digital piece of your Patelah tendon missing. Yeah, because your own own labs. So now I've probably had, I don't know how many hundreds of biopsies I've performed on people. Probably will over a thousand certainly will over a thousand. I've probably had 35 or 40 done on myself. There's no problem. I have no scar tissue. I have no loss of function. And I've stuck needles and every leg, like all over myself. Right, quads. My soleliest gastroch, like all up to taking tissue out. Yeah, you want it to needle. Looks like a pan basically and you, you know, you're live and you go in and grab a chunk and you pull it out and Can I come to your lab and get biopsies? Absolutely. Yeah, you're probably looking under the microscope. It'll just look like the molecule caffeine. There's a, there's a mutual friend of ours who came down to the debt. He's a big, big gentleman, big in the lifting. Very into strength training. And he, he went to that experience and he was like, oh my gosh. It was not what he was hoping to get. He actually had unbelievable muscle morphology. His fibers were the diameter of muscle fibers is extremely large. It's one of the biggest cells by volume and all the biology. He's got a muscle in human. And how large can he help myself? Millimeters? Well, you, so you have length. Right. I think why is it can be extraordinarily long? You can be the class of examples like your sartorias, which is like the front of your hip to the inside of your kneecap. Theoretically, those cells can run the entire length. Which would be one muscle fiber running that and thing. If you're far to do a biopsie and you and I pull that tissue out, I could actually pull an individual fiber out with tweezers and hold it up and you could see that whole muscle cell. Yeah, definitely not going to get biopsied. You'd be stunned how big they are. Anyway, it's his was the size of a rhino. So the diameter of his now he has a well documented assistance in the area of muscle growth, we'll say. But yeah, those can be large. So what were we even talking about there? Well, I was asking about tendons and ligaments because I'd like to understand the various tissues and organs systems that adapt when one gets stronger with muscle tissue grows. And I, I do want to ask about bone. Yeah. And here I'm not referring to bone mineral density. What I was going to ask is whether or not bone itself can grow and get stronger. And the reason I'm asking is there's a favorite result of mine. I have about 3800 favorite results. 3,000 pet peeves and 3800 plus favorite results. But one of my favorite results is from Eric and Del's Lab at Columbia, Eric, one of the Nobel Prize for learning a memory. And his laboratory got really into the effects of exercise on learning and memory. And they had this incredible result, which is that load bearing exercise stimulates the bones to release something called alce. Osteocalcin, excuse me. And then osteocalcin acts as a more or less a hormone travels to the brain and enhances the memory systems and the brain by enhancing neuron health. That's the basic crux of the studies that were several of these. And the moment I saw the first of those studies, I thought, well, here's another reason to do resistance type exercise. And not just aerobic exercise. And then it brings to mind whether or not bones themselves get stronger when we do resistance training. I don't know the answer to that. Yeah, that's very clearly demonstrated. And we've known that for many decades. You have a diminishing ability to do so with age. Particularly, you need to do this in your teens and twenties. As we're going to have the largest ability to enhance bone mineral density. And it's particularly responsive to axial loading. Now I'm a muscle guy. I'm not a bone specialist, so we would have to consult somebody who can give you more position here. But that's the point of axial loading. It's up and down. It's vertical. Okay, so it's almost like a cylinder, a kind of weight on the small end of the cylinder. Yep. I'm both small end of the cylinders. Yeah, if someone doesn't do this in their twenties or teens, however, can we assume that some degree of positive change will occur if they do resistance training. And if it's a small fraction, the answer is yes, it is small. We have worked with a number of women in our, um, a rapid health program at the Common and they are in their twenties and they're in their thirties. And they have significant bone mineral density problems. And eight months later, we can see noticeable changes that are outside of the Measurement error of a dex positive change positive change positive changes. Correct. And if you worked with the, there are many physicians that specialize in this area. You, you're going to need a new, new nutrition here. Strength training alone is probably not going to get you there, particularly with women because you have to figure out why. And, and there's a lot going on with the physiology and biochemistry. So you probably, like almost surely need to have some blood chemistry done with that. You have to figure out what's going on menstrual cycle wise. In fact, like oftentimes what we'll do for our women, very specifically, is we use a thing called the rhythm plus a 30 day test. So you can actually do a salary test across the entire menstrual cycle. And you can take samples, it's about every other day. So you get 15 or 16 samples and you get a really beautiful picture of what's happening or only across the entire menstrual cycle. And that's really, really important because typically for women, if you get a single sample or a simple time point, whether it's salary, urine or blood, you can have, um, well, like, a order of magnitude difference in any number of metrics because of what phase are in. This is one of the many reasons why it's been such a challenge to do a lot of physiology research with females. Some metrics change throughout the menstrual cycle. Others don't. Like strength is a very good example. I can strength train and I can do a one-to-a-one-out max test on a woman at any point. I don't have to do that at a certain phase of their menstrual cycle because it's, the evidence, I think, is pretty clear at this point. That number won't change. So I have no qualms including females in any of my studies where strength is an absolute, is an important dependent variable because I don't have to adjust around menstrual cycle. Other factors like anything in blood, anything hormone related, you're going to have to automatically account for it. So what I would say is those folks should absolutely work with a qualified physician. And you, you're going to have to get some nutrition supplementation potentially. And then maybe even some other stuff going on. To make that even more complicated, if you're on any form of birth control or not, that's going to change the entire equation especially if it's a hormone based birth control. So it just gets really, really complicated to answer it though. You can see adaptations. They are significantly diminished relative to if you are started in your teens and 20s. But there is hope. You just need to work with somebody specialized in that area. So for both men and women, boys and girls, what are the major adaptations? That occur to underlie improvements in strength? And if you would have you could just provide a bullet point list of that, and then we can dive into each of those in detail. For instance, our nerves getting more efficient at firing, our bones enjoying adaptations in different connective tissue relationships that underlies strength. I have to imagine all these things are happening. But what are the major changes that are occurring in those organs and organs systems that reflect someone's ability to on one day lift a hundred pounds and then a week later to lift a 105 pounds? Now I'll try to keep this condense again. This could be an entire university course. I will also try to give you a little bit of bones here. So normally as a muscle guy, I only take all the credit and muscle. Turns out the nervous system gets a little bit of credit to here. Thank you. So as we walk through it, just as a big picture. If we think about again, what causes human movement? Basically, everything along that chain will improve the strength training. And I'm not really being using too much hyperbally there. It's quite impressive. So it's going from the nervous system side to the equation. What has to happen for human movement is a nerve-assassinist signal through a motor unit. Now a motor unit comes down and it integrates multiple muscle fibers. So if you think about your actual muscle, it's not a thing. It is a component of many individual muscle fibers. So you've got millions if not more. Think of it like a ponytail. So we collectively say ponytail and you think of it as like one thing. But really, a ponytail is a combination of tons of individual hairs. Muscles the same way. So this motor unit comes in and generates a lot of different muscle fibers. Now every one of the fibers in a motor unit is generally of the same fiber type. So fast which are slow twitch. And they are not laid out next to each other in the muscle. They are spread out across horizontally vertically as well as closer to the bone and further to the surface. So they're moved throughout the entire way. And this is what allows you to have smoother contractions and you don't have specificity and things like that. So we see improvements from the neuromuscular side like firing rate. We see synchronization improvements that are coming in. You also see improvements in things like a cdocole and release from the presynaptic neuron. So you're getting it faster. We see calcium recycling is improved back to there. So in order for without walking into too much of the biochemistry. In order for a signal to go from nerve to muscle, there's a little bit of a gap. There's a physical space that happens. And when happens as you release this molecule called the cdocolein, it goes into the post synaptic left and then that actually binds to a receptor. That receptor actually opens up a door that lets sodium in. That's really what's happening. So it's not the cdocolein. Without a cdocolein then sits on that receptor site. It's broken down, put back and and recycle back up in the presynaptic nerve site. The faster you can do that, the faster you can recycle that signal. And so almost everything that I described in that entire system improves and has been shown to increase with training. So that alone is given to give you benefits. We haven't even walked into getting from electrical signal now into an actual potential, which is going to cause a muscle contraction. So getting from nerve into the muscle. We see everything from improvements that we call contractility, which means the muscle fiber themselves can produce more force or more velocity independent of muscle size changes. So this is another component when we asked like, how is it like a stronger without getting bigger? Well in the muscle fiber itself, it's ability to contract force increases. And this is because we have everything like the sarcoplasmic, we're tickling, which is the place stores and releases a calcium, which is what's needed for this entire cross bridge interaction or the mice and an actin. To happen, I know a lot, I think it's lost a lot of people, but you can go look at some of these images. The sarcoplasmic tricking gets, gets activated more. It gets more sense. It is better at releasing calcium, bringing it back in and doing it again. The bond between the cross bridge and the mice and an actin gets stronger. The calcium affinity is the phrase that we use there increases. So we were literally walking through almost the entire process of skeletal muscle contraction here. And every step along the way we see improvements. So that net result is we see again more force production independent of any change in size, independent of any increase in contract value units. We didn't add anything to the equation, we didn't change size. We didn't nothing but improve efficiency effectively. Independent of that, now we can actually start talking about changing muscle fiber type. So we can change our fibers from a slow twitch fiber to a fast twitch fiber. That alone is going to give you more force production again independent of size. Fast twitch fibers tend to be larger than slow twitch fibers, but not always, especially in the presence of endurance training. So if you do a lot of consistent endurance training, it's very common for us to find slow twitch fibers that are as similar size, if not larger, often very often larger than the fast twitch fibers. If you do a lot of slow fibers, big slow, very metabolically effective fiber. So extremely fatigue resistant. So it's not a bad thing to call them slow. We tend to say fastest low and slow has this negative connotation, but it's quite healthy, like fiber type to have. Outside of that, now we haven't even gotten into things like penacean angle. So this is an angle at which your muscle fibers interact with your bone. So we tend to think about this as like a muscle fiber is pulling on a muscle. Well some of these are oriented at almost a 90 degree. So a fiber runs perpendicular into the bone. And some of them are closer to like a 45 degree, and some of them are closer to almost parallel. And that confirms a lot of unique mechanical benefits. So in one area, it's actually going to increase force production. You go the other direction increases velocity. And so we have all kinds of changes in the angle at which the muscle inserts into the bone. Now we're already in the mechanic side of it, right? So we've influenced how effectively it pulls. And with any of these things, it's always a given take. So you're going to give up in the case of donation angle. You're going to give up strength, but you're going to increase a lot of shortening velocity. Or if you want to increase the velocity, you're going to give up sort of the strength. Right? We haven't gotten to any of the energetics at all. So we haven't talked about increasing storage of phosphorecreating, which is the energy system needed to power that muscle contraction at the fastest possible. Right? So we could continue to go as long as you want here, but hopefully you're getting the point of a little bit of the adaptations that occur. The reason I want to actually, why I think that's so important to bring it back. Maybe for some listeners, I know I took you on a journey there and you're just like, what the hell just happened. That matters because again, this is the specific explanation for how is it possible that I got stronger, but I didn't get bigger. And this is also why strength and hypertrophy are intertwined and heavily overlapped, but are not necessarily the same thing. So for example, weakening increase muscle size and actually reduce strength because of what's called lattice spacing. So what happens is, you have to remember, your muscle fibers are these long cylinders. And though the way that they contract requires an optimal space. And so what happens is you have this molecule called actin, and you have this molecule called myosin. Myosin sits in the middle and there are six actin that surround each individual myosin in a three-dimensional circle here. So you got a myosin in the middle of the house of these globular heads and they can reach up and grab an actin. And again, there are six sort of around them, right? Well, one of the things that can occur is if those actin are too close together. So I'm adding my hands, I'm reaching out and doing a giant T, right? So I'm horizontal out there. Well, if my fingertips are the tips of the myosin, and I'm trying to reach up and grab an actin. And I want to pull those actin's closer to my face. Well, those actin's stack on top of each other, and that's what actually makes your muscles grow up. Like if I flex my bicep, it actually grows up three or four inches. Because you're stacking these sarcomers, or what they're called on top of each other. All right, great. Well, if I'm reaching out to grab them, and the muscle is stretched too far, I can actually make that strong of a connection. It would be like if I reached out and grabbed something, but I can only reach my longest finger tip on it. When I go to contract, I can't make that strong of a contraction because my grip is weak. My grip is going to break before I reach my strength limit. If I'm too close, there's nowhere to go. I'm already as close. So if you actually disrupt that lattice spacing too much, you can actually lose a little bit of strength. So it's not that getting bigger will ever make you weaker. It's simply that you're not optimizing for strength. You're simply optimizing for size. And so that can explain a little bit of the discongurity between growing and performance.

What are a few of the major changes that occur in muscle, nerve, et cetera when we experience hypertrophy? I've heard of protein synthesis. Yeah, changes. I'm assuming that's true. Maybe you can tell us a bit more about that. Changes in blood flow. Yep. Perhaps changes in neural innovation. Who knows, maybe even changes in fascia. Yeah, I'm not aware of any specifically, but I have to imagine that they're somehow involved. Sure. So when we talk about hypertrophy, a lot of the adaptations are going to be similar because the mode of training is close enough. So your nerve probably aren't smart enough to differentiate between a set of five reps or a set of eight repetitions. They're smart enough to differentiate anything. They know everything that's going on, but it's going to be huge overlap. The primary difference with hypertrophy is a couple of things. So if you think about the muscle microstructure, I have a whole series of videos on these. If you want to see the visuals behind this, in fact, in there I include the specific diameter size of muscle fibers that I was failed to give you a few minutes to get it. We will provide an active link to that. Great. So what happens is this? When we talk about, and you hear that this classic buzz phrase of muscle protein synthesis, generally what we're talking about there is contractile units. And so when we say contractile units, we're talking about the Maya synonectin. So what we're really trying to do is say, okay, there's some amount of protein turnover, where we're coming in and we're trying to add more proteins to the equation. So it has to happen there is a series of steps. So step number one is there has to be some sort of signal from the external world. This could actually oftentimes, it's things like stretching of the cell wall, which is what happens with exercise, right? So you're contracting a shortening, get this big stretch of the cell wall. It can come from as simple things like an amino acid infusion. This is just eating protein. This is why protein ingestion alone is anabolic. It will help you grow muscle independent of even moving. So just eating protein will grow your muscles. Yeah, certainly. And those data are very clear. Of course, like anything, there's a saturation point. In terms of total amount you need to get to and things like that. But yeah, if you were to walk into a laboratory fasted overnight, and I gave you 30 grams of protein, we would see a very imaginable increase in protein since it's quite clearly. For several hours, probably four to five plus hours, we could maybe bring us to people that we know those data better. But many hours. We know what you're doing. Correct. I embedding that most people are not aware of that fact. You know what's actually interesting about it is, if you do the exact same study again, and you just did strength training, you would also see improvement of protein synthesis, right? But those factors are independent, and the mechanisms are independent. Such that if you do them both together, they stack on top of each other, which is really wonderful. And if you were to add carbohydrate into that mix, and now you're actually adding fuel for the entire muscle protein synthesis process, and now you're going to see even added benefits. And this is why for so many years, this is what bore the whole post-sector-size antibody-quendou thing, which is like you got to get carbs and protein and post-sector-size to maximize muscle-sector-quendou. Also, I'm pretty sure we know that turned out to be not totally true in terms of the window. The window does not be as strict as people initially asserted as I recall, but that's the way. I think that's super interesting. These are parallel pathways for proteins synthesis, simply eating protein, or training each independently increases protein synthesis. I can't help but ask, is the same true if one doesn't under its type exercise. If I go out for a 45-minute jog, where I can nasal breathe the whole time, but if I were to go any faster out, I have to kick over into mouth breathing as well. So I'll call it the zone two-ish cardio. Will I see an increase in protein synthesis as simply as a consequence of that jog? Now, this is one of the unique factors of strength training. You're not going to see it. Then in fact, you had a typical dementia-propertying breakdown. That's been as extraordinarily challenging to do in laboratory, but you're not going to see those benefits. In fact, you're going to see quite the opposite. It's an entire molecular cascade. So this is kind of how it works. So you have to have some signal on the outside. This can be an energetic signal. So this could be glucose uptake. It could be protein intake. It could be a physical stretch. What happens is on the cell wall, there's some sort of, it could be testosterone. Cestosterone could bind to beta-adrenaline receptors, and this activates a whole series of cascades of signaling proteins. And these proteins basically play a game of telephone. So one tells the next one, this is the next one, and I sort of walk this entire way. Well, that molecular cascade is fundamentally the same thing, whether it regardless of the insult, but they're different pathways. And so the pathway from strength training or protein and gestion is going to go to the same nucleus. It's going to activate a whole set of gene cascades that are going to tell you to go through this entire process or protein synthesis, which I'll walk through without using a second. If you do endurance training, it's a different pathway. And so instead of activating this entire thing of like M-TOR and AKT, and this is anabolic signaling cascade, it's going to do a different one, which you can think of more of like as M-P-K, and energy signaling things. So there's a crossover point here. In fact, one of the things you'll notice is M-TOR and AKT don't really influence M-P-K, but there's some literature that years ago showed M-P-K will activate another protein called TSC2, and that will actually inhibit M-TOR. And that was the first molecular explanation for the quote-unquote interference effect of endurance training on hypertrophy. Could you just say highlight for people what this is? Because as you describe these signaling pathways, I just want to just put a top contour explanation. The M-TOR pathway is synonymous with cell growth, both during development as organisms, humans, included mature, and cells get larger. M-TOR is abundant in the system. It's just to put it quite simply. And then the M-P-K pathway, and some of the metabolic signaling that you were referring to is more synonymous with cardiovascular exercise in this, at least in the context of this discussion, and fuel utilization. Yep. And what you describe is a crossover point where certain forms of exercise can tap into both of these. Yep. But at least for taking this conversation, we're largely separating them. Yeah, because the byproduct is the thing that matters here. So the result of M-TOR and AKT getting into the nucleus is going to be increased in protein synthesis. The result of M-P-K running down to the mic is going to be result in increasing mitochondrial biogenesis. So the net outcome is different. Now, I do want to flag it very quickly. This is an extraordinarily complicated thing. And in fact, in our lab, which we were able to be one of the first that figured out how to measure all the different subunits of M-P-K and individual muscles by fiber type. So it's just as you're ripping people's muscles out of their knees and their fateler tendency. So just teasing, they're gently removing with under IRB protocol, of course. So even when we say something like M-P-K, it's not one thing. M-M-TOR, it's not one thing either. You have the total amount that matters. You have the activation sites or many of them. So it's not as simple as what I'm laying it out of. I just want a big concept of kind of what's happening here to actually kind of answer your question, which is, okay. So how is the muscle actually growing? What you have to understand is a little bit of how protein synthesis occurs. So what I'm generally meaning is you have a whole bunch of amino acids. And this actually goes back to maybe like middle school biology class, right? So if you take a bunch of amino acids and you combine them together we get these things called a peptide, right? And if anyone who's ever heard of like peptides, that's all it really means. You put a bunch of those together, you have a poly peptide. You put a bunch of those together and we now have a protein. So any protein I want to make is going to go through the exact same system. The exact same steps. It doesn't matter if that protein is going to be a red blood cell. It doesn't matter if that's going to be a hair follicle. It doesn't matter if it's going to be skeletal muscle. That's basically protein synthesis. So when we tend to think of protein synthesis, we just paint this picture of growing more muscle. And that's not the only thing. And so when we talk about the benefits of having high quality muscle is being this place that's going to regulate most of your protein synthesis, we tend to lose some people because they're thinking, oh, I don't need to gain muscle. And that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about regulating the immune system, we're talking about regulating any protein turnover. So any protein that's degradated or needs to be broken down in your system at all, at all, at top of you. This is such an important buzzword. That's just protein breakdown of an unneeded or damaged protein. That whole thing is going to go through protein synthesis to be able to come back and replace things. The only reason you go through a top of you is so you can clean that car, but you're going to come back and build in a more properly functioning protein. So it's not just about growing more muscle masses, why you want these systems to be operating well. So the protein ingestion is going to just activate that cascade, because it's basically saying, oh, hey, look, we have an abundance of supply here. Why don't we make something out of it? Because we don't know the next time this thing is going to be around. Carbohydrates and it's fat are very easy to store. Protein is very challenging, it's more transient. And so you can store some of it and keep it around, but most of it you're going to lose. And so when it's available, your body wants to act very quickly. It doesn't necessarily care if you have extra fat floating around in your system. All right, let's back with you up in store where we can easily bring this back out. But if you've got protein around, you're going to want to use it. And so that's why it alone will activate an increased protein synthesis independent of exercise. So those effects are additive, like I said, because that signaling process is independent. And once you hit a rate limiting phase, then you are there. But it's on set, those things will work independently. Okay, so that being said, what is skeletal muscle hypertrophy? In general, we think about it as this increasing contractal protein. So those mice and an act affect, effectively get thicker. Okay, now what happens is since they are thicker, and as I talked about a second ago, that influences and actually hurts the lattice spacing. And so what your body does as a result to say, hey, let's increase the diameter of the entire cell so that we can maintain our spacing between these things. It's effectively like if the two of us were sitting in this room. And you doubled in the size. And I was like, whoa, you're in my personal space. Like, and I doubled in size. Now we're in each other space. At some point, we just have to make the room larger. And that's exactly what's happening in the cell. And so as you can continue to increase muscle size, you're going to, or a muscle, myalphobular, uh, accretion, you're going to continue to increase muscle fiber size. For years, there was this other comment about, um, non-functional hypertrophy. And this is often called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Now this is not sarcoplasmic, we're chicken them. This is the fancy way of saying, my muscle is larger, but it has no function. And the question would be, wow, the hell is that possible? If I have more contractile units, and I can make more of these cross bridges, perform more of these power strokes, this is what these contractions are called. How could I possibly be the losing function? Well, it, that was challenged for, that was broscience for a very, very long time. And in fact, where it really came down to was, are there different types of hypertrophy training? Some that induce contractile protein hypertrophy, and some that induce, is a sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. And that was the significantly challenged, until recently, Mike Roberts did, uh, at Auburn, did a series of wonderful studies that showed quite clearly that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is probably happening. Um, and in fact, there's probably a pretty easy explanation. In general, what happens is it is, it is an increase in fluid in the muscle fiber. And so this would allow for the damage to be larger, but since there's no addition of contractile units, no more force production happens. And so he actually has a wonderful review paper. I believe it's open access. Where you can go look and you created a wonderful graph. Um, I think that's in my, in my hypertrophy videos on YouTube as well. And you can actually see that it's likely happening in phasic, changes throughout your training experience. So at the beginning of your training, but as, as the years and years or weeks or other months, and then eventually years go by in your training, we have a change in the hypertrophy that's coming from contractile units versus sarcoplasmic. Um, so I think that it's an important note because, again, people are wondering like, well, how the hell is it impossible for me to get larger muscle and somehow I'm not stronger? Well, if it came from simply fluid retention and this is not bloating, this is not, there's no negative really to this. It is simply, um, holding of more hydration in the cell, the amygous larger, and then everything works that way. What you just described calls to mind something similar in the nervous system, which is neuroplasticity, which of course is the nervous system, to ability to change in response to learning and experience and damage for that matter. Yeah. And we think about it as one term, but there are many different forms of neuroplasticity. Yeah. Discussion that we don't need to get into now, but they're spiked timing dependent plastic E and LTP in long term depression, which has nothing to do with psychological depression and on and impaired pulse facilitation, and on and on and on and on and on and short term plasticity. And so what I'm starting to understand is that there are many paths to what we call strength increase and there are many paths to what we think of as hypertrophy. Many of these are going to operate in parallel. It's going to be rare that any one of them is going to be active alone in order to create hypertrophy or strength changes. And that certain forms of exercise and certain ways of doing exercises in terms of sets and repetition schemes and rest intervals between sets and between training sessions are going to tap into different mechanisms. But also overlapping sets of mechanisms, which is why, if I understand correctly, you mentioned at the beginning, that often not always, but often strength increases or associate with some hypertrophy changes. And hypertrophy increases are often not always associated with strength increases. Do I have that right? Correct. The beauty of this whole thing is while we don't yet know the mechanisms specifically. And there's a lot of confusion and there's a lot of changes that happen. There's a, we actually just submitted a paper a few days ago. Myself, Jimmy Bagley at San Francisco and Kevin Miracat, one has a wonderful muscle physiology lab at Arkansas. And we actually, this is a very lay article actually. It's incredibly easy to read. We describe the role of my own nucleation in muscle hypertrophy. And this is actually a lot of interesting stuff we can get into there. But we're learning more and more about it as a quick example. So, skill and muscle is unique in the fact that it is so large and diameter. It's also unique in the fact that it's multi-new-clated. What that means is typically in biology, you see like ASL has one nucleus. That's the place that houses and holds the DNA and it's a control center. That's a degrosuring, die repair, about a whole thing. Well, skeletal muscle in human is awesome because it has thousands, if not more, there's nuclei, which gives it that plasticity. And so a normal cell has one place that has to go to. For any time it wants to, about regulate, down regulate, do whatever the thing is. Your muscle fibers have these little control centers all throughout them. And for years, we were like, okay, great. The amount of hypertrophy that you can experience is probably limited by the amount of new nuclei you have because you're not going to exceed a certain size of muscle fiber if that's going to mean you lose control. And so we're like, okay, great. We've found and identified a limiting factor to what will determine how much muscle can actually grow. And then the next question was then, then, where are these things coming from? And this is where satellite cells came in. And so it was very clear a satellite cell that's lying dormant sort of on the outside of the periphery of the fiber will then go in into the fiber. We'll turn into a mountain nuclei and then it can actually increase your diameter like that. And so then actually it was like, hey, you're actually limited by the amount of these satellite cells you can get in and turn into a nuclear. And then the evidence came out that showed, hey, what if you detrain? So what if I used to lift weights like a long time ago and I got big, but now I've lost a lot of my muscle. If I train again, you actually get that muscle back faster than it took you the very first time to build it. Like that's what we call muscle memory, like an arphal now. On your side equation, muscle memory is something different rights in your brain. Well, when people talk about muscle memory, like the ability to ride a bicycle after so many years of not having tried to ride one, that's actually largely independent of the muscle has something to do with muscle. It's exclusively independent of the muscle. It's basically a nervous system phenomenon. 100% of muscle memory has been co-opted by different communities to mean different things. So on our side muscle memory is going to mean that ability to remember that muscle size, right, that hyperatured because as you explained. The motor control thing is that it's a totally a nerve thing. This is the one, I'll give you this one. You guys the nerve people can have this one. Well, it seems to me that there are a tremendous number of parallels between strength and hyperitrophy changes and neuroplasticity. This is coming up again and again in this conversation because we know for instance that if you are exposed to a couple of different languages. Early on in life, you will learn any number of different languages far more easily later in life. Of course, and that's because there's some crossover between different languages, but you've gotten based on languages that allows for that. There's a substrate for it. It's similar to the ability to run a bicycle again phenomenon or plan instrument phenomenon, but it's broader than that. And again, I think that speaks to the huge number of different adaptive changes that are occurring in the cells and then the nerves that generate these cells when one experiences. Experiences increases in strength and the hyperitrophy. So to round that out in the go back to where I was saying that what we're actually learning now is that nucleation thing. And by the way, this entire trajectory story is probably over the last like eight years. Like this is how fast we've changed our understanding of how muscle grows. The sarcophagus in particular, five years ago was brought to science now. It's pretty well established. The mountain nucleation thing was eight to ten years ago. Changing every week. This paper we just submitted this week showed actually why we had generally thought a few years ago. And in fact, you can find me on podcasts and probably in some of my videos talking about this. And I'm going to tell you right now those things are wrong. Like we've just had new things come out in this last couple years where that detraining effect we thought was a reason of what happens is if you had the muscle before. And you brought in these nuclei and they differentiated and turned into a nuclean. And then the muscle got small again. You preserve those nuclei. And that's why when you go to train again, they were already around. So the muscle grows faster the second time they did the first time. Well now it looks like that's actually not the case. In fact, it's actually probably what's happening is it's a it's a epigenetic change. In the nuclei's ability to access the DNA needed to grow muscle. It's effectively the analogy we used. It's the nuclei are remembering how to write a bike. So it's quite funny that you said that because it's not really necessarily that they're being preserved over time. They have learned the sequence it takes to grow the protein there and it goes it happens faster the second time. And we've also learned that there are specific nuclei. We've known this for actually a while. We found this in our lab. We didn't discover it. We just saw this in our summer or our neighbors. But there are different shapes than nuclei. Some are more oval, some are more elongated. And the shape determines a lot of the function. Some of them are hanging out more towards a periphery and some of them are hanging out right around the nucleus. Well it looks like there's actually probably different types of nuclei. A lot of them that are specific to the mitochondria. In fact, you can see like on some of the imaging we have, you're just like they're just packed around the the the model. And there are some that are probably specific to injury repair. And so this is probably explaining a lot of the individual variation. I mean, I know you've you've said previously like you're just a very you're very slow at recovery. There's a lot of things that go into that and I would I would love to walk through sort of all the buckets. Well maybe later in the recovery. But one of the inherent genetic variations is could be simply that you maybe have more or less of the nuclei responsible for tissue repair. That's something that's been happening in the last like handful of months that's been coming out. We'll see if that holds up is true or not. So as we're learning more and more almost every day about muscle physiology, what's super fun and interesting and I think the most exciting. What to do in terms of like how to train and how to eat and how to do everything else to get these adaptations has been pretty well established for a long long long time. We're just figuring out how like what's happening in the muscle now, but we know what to do. So from a practical standpoint, putting together protocols for any outcome that you want or don't want for any modality, you don't have a gym. You have, uh, weights, you have dumbbells only, you only have kettlebells, you don't want it, you only use body weight. We can only have three days a week, you have seven days a week, you want to maximize muscle growth, you want to get a little bit stronger. Any of these variables you want to throw at me, we have a large evidence base for exactly how to get those adaptations and not others. So while we have a lot to learn about the mechanisms and the physiology, we have pretty good legs to stand on terms of what to do to get whatever adaptations you want. So what are the essential components of an effective strength and hypertrophy protocol? Okay, so what I would like to actually do is is walking through both of those because as we mentioned before, they overlap, but the training needs to be differentiated so that you can optimize either strength, hypertrophy, or if you actually want, you can get a combination of both. This allows you to then get the adaptation you want, avoid once you don't want, and then get it even a combination of that's the preference. So we will a lot of people will talk about, I want to get a little stronger, I want to add some muscle. That's a different answer than someone who wants to truly maximize muscle, which is a different answer from somebody who will maximize, wants to maximize strength, which is a different answer from somebody who wants to maximize strength, but not actually gain muscle. So we have all these combinations. What's important to understand before we get into the details is a couple of things. We've been teasing this concept so far of the concepts or few, but the methods are many, and so I want to hit those concepts right now. These are, as you, as you say, these are the non-negotiables that have to happen in any training program and I'm referring to these in this strength and hypertrophy conversation, but these are true of power developments, be development, most of their endurance, endurance, any other thing. These are things that just have to happen for any training program to work. I mentioned one, a little bit earlier, which was adherence. And so that my frequent collaborator, Dan Garner will constantly say, consistency beats intensity. Again, in fact, literature will show you very clearly adherence is a non-moant predictor of physical fitness outcome. So we want to do something that you will engage in, you'll put effort into it when you'll be able to repeat this in single over time. Number one, the second one is, and this is a major reason that people don't hit their fitness goals. In fact, I would argue outside of not doing it, the number one mistake they make is progressive overload. So I'm going to walk you through exactly how much you should be increasing your sets and reps in a way, et cetera, per week, per month later. But that's the biggest thing. You have got to have some sort of overload. The body works as an adaptation mechanism, right? So in fact, we talked previously about the Harvard fatigue lab. And one of the things actually people don't realize is the concept of homeostasis is actually comes from research of the Harvard fatigue lab. It was a work that they did on an endurance runner up. I forget his name. And it sort of realized that after a long period of time working out, this is an acute exercise about the body actually comes back to some stable place, despite the fact he was continuing to work. And that's exactly what bore the phrase, steady state. And that actually then they launched off and said, wow, there's this state that the body wants to be in and we'll call this homeostasis. So those all concept came out of exercise physiology, which is really really cool, right? We don't get a lot of love a lot of times scientifically, but that's a good one that we took. So why that all matters is we have got to achieve some sort of overload without going excess. So we'll cover that later exactly what to do and we'll get potentially get an overtraining and monitoring and managing things like that. But you have to have some sort of consistent predictable overload. That's what's going to cause that adaptation to continue to cost rest. If you don't do that, you can still do things like burn calories. You can still get some of the other benefits of exercise like improved mood, cognitive function, et cetera, et cetera, flexibility increases. All those can happen without a progressive overload. But if you want to see these games and strength and hypertrophy, you really need to progress with overload. That's concept number two. The third one here is going to be individualization. And this is where we can get into things like personal preference. You know, equipment availability. You have kettlebells or dumbbells, you only have bands, you have none of that. These are all smaller details, but that's an important component to it. The last one I really want to get into is picking the appropriate target. And we went through this when we talked about the fitness protocol. And if you run through something like that and you run some testing and figure out where your biggest limitations are, that's going to help you identify where you need to go. So if you can do all those things, you're going to be in a good spot to balance specificity and variation. All right. So if you want to make sure you grow your biceps, you better make sure your biceps are working. Having said that, if you overrely on specificity, you're going to increase the likelihood of overuse injuries, which is going to come back and actually hamper consistency over time. All right. So this is when hedging toward specificity is important, but too much can cause a problem. If you go the other direction and you go too much variation, so imagine you're just sort of doing all kinds of different exercises every time you work out. That's actually not enough stimuli directly on the muscle or muscle groups or movement pattern if you're wanting to learn our new movement to get you very far. And so this is a classic problem of I'm doing a lot of work, but I don't have a very clear direction. I lack specificity, so I'm working, but I'm not seeing a lot of improvements. And this is like in the business world, etc. This is like doing a whole bunch of different things means you get nothing really done. So that's the game we're going to play here. Right. How do we overload this stuff? How do we make sure we're balancing specificity and variation? How do we make sure I want to do this and then how do I individualize it from my needs, the circumstances and and movement restrictions and of time availability and my calendar and desires and all these things. So those are the concepts we absolutely have to hit. The methods that we choose run across a handful of variables and we call these things modify a variables because as you modify them or you make different choices within these variables, you get different outcomes or adaptations. This is exactly what determines the nine adaptations that we've been talking about. So the way that I like to say this is exercises do not determine adaptation. So you can't simply go, I want to get stronger. Therefore, I'm going to choose these exercises. That's not how it works. What determines adaptation is the execution of the exercises. So deadlift is my favorite example. A deadlift is a common example that people think of when they want to choose a lower body strength exercise. But a deadlift will not increase your strength unless you're executing it in the proper fashion. I'm not only talking about technique here. I'm talking about these modifiable variables. The same thing for power exercises will commonly see mistakes of doing activities like a box jump, which is great. People think, oh, I'm going to get improved my power, which we know is extremely highly correlated to activities of daily living and particularly living on assisted as you age, right, is reduction of power. So they'll do an activity like a box jump. What they're failing to realize is unless you do it powerfully, you won't actually increase power. If you don't move fast, you won't get faster. So the way that we manipulate these variables is everything to determining the adaptation you get or again, don't get. So without foundation, I think we can kind of run right into these things and we can start off with perhaps speed and power. And what I would like to do is walk you through all those modifiable variables, what to do with them. And then hit you with as many different methodologies as we really have time for. And then we move on to strength and hypertrophy and kind of around the entire thing out. And then maybe at the end we can talk some other variables like what happens if I have a training protocol. And I'm halfway through and I can't finish my workout. What should I do? Wait or reduce my duration or things like that. So there's lots of wood if scenarios that we can go through that potentially a lot of people listening have questions about. So sound like a plan sounds like a plan. I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker. Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your media and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, etc. But you don't know what to do with that information. Inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course, but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can visit inside tracker.com slash human to get 20% off any of inside tracker's plans. Again, that's inside tracker.com slash human to get 20% off. So just interrupt briefly and make sure that I and everybody else have in mind the proper nine adaptations that we've been referring to and that we're discussed in detail in episode one. I have listed number one skill and technique number two speed number three power, which is speed times force number four strength number five high-perchrophy number six muscular endurance number seven and aerobic capacity number eight maximum aerobic capacity number nine long duration steady state exercise. Yep, you nailed it. Thank you for that. It was probably important clarification for everybody. So that being said, let's jump right into speed and power. Now I'll do these a little bit simultaneously. They are different. If you're a high performance athlete, you really need to separate these two things. For the most people though, we can probably think about them as this is the same thing. There's not a lot of pure speed training that the general public is is interested in. If you want to actually further break down speed, there are multiple components. There's acceleration, there's top and velocity, there's change of direction or agility things like that. So we'll just kind of call them all that speed and power for now. Now at the onset, there's this three to five concept that we talked about many times where this is really fairly true for speed, power, or strength. Now I didn't develop the three to five is just an easy way to help you remember one concept that will run through across all these things. So three to five refers to three to five days per week. Pick three to five exercises and you're going to do three to five repetitions per set. You'll do three to five sets and you'll rest three to five minutes between each set. You can't do that and you execute any of the exercises you choose at a high intent. And that part is critical. You don't get faster by moving kind of fast. You can't improve power by moving like, and powerfully. You have to be trying regardless of whether actually moving faster or not. Any time you're talking about speed or power, you're by definition using sub maximal weights. So you're going to be able to lift it. That's not the question. The question is how fast can you lift that implement. And so intention is incredibly important. So if you do that the same for strength, by the way. So if you land on that, that allows you to run the gamut from as little as three days a week. You're doing a three exercises. You're going to do three sets of three. Which is a very very low volume. It's a very low amount of days easy to handle. All the way to five sets of five of five exercises five days a week. So it's again, it's just one sample that's something easy to remember and is quite effective for a very long time. And this has been. Tested quite extensively in both coaching realms as well as the scientific realms to be quite productive and easy to follow and grasp. If you do that, all you need to do is slightly increase the load. Or the volume mostly the load over time. And the number we want to look for there is something like a three to five percent increase per week. So an example would be if you're going to do an exercise at a hundred pounds, you can't necessarily just add five pounds every week. That's going to get you pretty quickly. And so you may have to run some a smaller increment. If you're doing like a lower body exercise where you might have a couple of hundred pounds on the way, you can probably get away with adding five pounds because it's still a low percentage of the total load. So that's roughly the guide that we want to get to for speed power and strength. So that sounds incredibly simple and effective. Yet I have a number of questions. First off, if somebody is using the three to five approach, does that mean they should not be doing any other weight training of any kind. In those workouts or at all. No, you can certainly do that in combination with anything else you would like, especially if you think about speed and power. Those are very non-futiging. And so if you can imagine you're going to go to the beach and you're going to take a ten pound to twenty pound medicine ball with you. And you're going to do four different exercises where you're throwing the medicine ball as high as you can in the air, four times in a row, taking a break and you two or three hits that. You do maybe three or four different types of throws. That's very good for improving power extremely good, but it's not very fatiguing. So you could certainly finish that workout in twenty minutes and then run on and then do any number of other things. So you could do some high intensity and a row of capacity work, you could do studies, states of you could even do hypertrophy on top of that. So there's two major categories of what we call a piritization. There's many, many, many of them. But the two that have the most scientific literature are what's called linear piritization. And another is called undulating, or often daily undulating piritization. And I'm flagging these two again despite the fact there are many, many, many more because they represent two different concepts. So you've actually just touched upon. So linear piritization is a hallmarked by basically saying we're going to train one adaptation at a time. So imagine going say six to eight weeks and you're only doing strength or you're only doing hypertrophy or endurance for that matter. So in that particular case, you would not do anything else in combination. If you contrast that to undulating piritization, you would actually be doing multiple different styles of training, either within the same day or just different days. So it could be Monday is power, Wednesday is strength, Friday is hypertrophy, whatever, or it could be a little bit of strength every single day, a little bit of hypertrophy every day, a little bit of power every day. And you would just change the amount of each that you do within the day to alter the emphasis. All right, now, if you look at the studies and there have been many RCTs on this. The result of both these training programs is generally basically the same thing. They are equally effective. Here's the major difference though. One, if your goal is very specific to one outcome, you want a head to our specificity. So if you're like, hey, I'm trying to maximize the amount of muscle I can build in the next eight weeks. Then you don't really anything else besides that is just distraction and potential interference. Does it really matter or not, it doesn't matter, but it's not helping anything else. So linear piritization is fundamental, I'm providing focus. And therefore the adaptations tend to be oftentimes larger in that specific area. That downside is you now go six to eight to ten weeks of doing nothing else. And so you are losing those other adaptations that are great at a faster rate. And you can imagine doing something like speedwork only. Again, speedwork by definition is non-feteking. So when oftentimes we think of speedwork as like, oh, I did ladder drills and I did all these things and like I threw up at the end. But that's not speedwork. You just did a different type of endurance training. Which is great and important. So true speedwork is very high rest, very low fatigue, and actually truly trying to reach a new level of speed or velocity. So non-feteking. If you did that exclusively for ten weeks, you would be pretty unfit. By the end of it. Because you did, you would also lose these in a monomusyl mass, not because there's an interference effect. But simply because of fact, you have not stimulated muscle growth for eight to ten weeks. And so neither one of these is better than the other. We're going to see this classically across all program design or piritization strategies. It's just a given tick. There are tons of different systems and perhaps at the end we can talk about some of the more advanced piritization styles. These ones are both effective. You could do these with beginners. You could do these with advanced athletes. You could do them any spectrum. But there are some of them are well documented ones. It's just a pro and con game. It's what are you willing to give up? The way that you solve that problem is going back to that fitness assessment and your analysis. And really truly understanding what your goal is. Is your goal to do a little bit of strength and a little bit of strength? Okay, great. Maybe on gelated piritization is an approach. If your goal is really to maximize strength and maybe you can wait on putting some muscle mass on. Maybe linear piritization is a better approach or another style of piritization. That's optimal for strength. So it's just simply about addressing your things. One of the major problems folks have in addition to lacking progressive overload is they don't have any foresight past the next day of the training. And so it's really important that you set off blocks that are anywhere between six to 12 weeks long. Where you're going to have the specific plan ideally you have an idea for the whole year. I actually have like a structure I can walk you through for that. But even if you don't have that really think about what you want the next 12 weeks and then maybe the next 12 weeks after that. And that's going to give you a lot of guidance about what to do and what to focus on. Terrific. What about warming up? I was taught that one should do higher repetition movements with lighter weights in order to warm up and then one of the things that did make a big positive difference for me in terms of strength and hypertrophy training was to do a moderate repetition warm up with a fairly lightweight. But then to actually keep the number of warm up repetitions fairly low and work progressively toward the first so called works set. When you say three to five. That's three to five worksets correct. Yep. You also going to tell me three to five warmups. No. Are you also going to tell me it has to be done between three and five p.m. So in terms of what you know. In all seriousness, what does a good warm up look like? And I realize this will vary depending on how cool your training environment is, time of day, et cetera. But as it kind of umbrella for a good warm up. Okay. What should people do? The you've already sort of jumped the gun with my answer. It is honestly very dependent upon the person. So some folks respond very well to a minimum more and more. Oh, there's I've had lots of professional fighters I've worked with. Where I actually have a major baseball player right now. He's one of the best pitchers in the game. Probably the best. And the longer we warm up, the better his numbers get. We actually did a vertical jump test with him. He's going to kill me because he got so mad. I wanted to see how long it sort of took him to reach a peak vertical jump. And most times this takes people something like five to ten sort of reps. And I said, take it up all the way to a maximum vertical jump. And then what I want you to do is continue to jumping until you have three consecutive jumps or you're down lower than 90%. And so what we're trying to look at is sort of when is he going to break because in baseball he's going to throw like a hundred pitchers or so. And I figured out when is his peak velocity on his fastball going to drop and sort of basis conditioning on that. So a different style of conditioning. It's power endurance. He's really what it is. He called me in the middle of it. I'm like, oh, he done whatever he's just like, no, like how many of these am I supposed to do. And I was like, what he's talking about he's like, I'm on rep 130 or something. And I was like, what? And I'm like, what rep did you peek on? He peeked on rep 70. Something like that. 69 I think technically because he's goofy. So he's a classic example. I've worked in for many, many years. We have a ton of data on him, a ton of biological data, a ton of neural muscular stuff like all kinds of stuff. And it just the more he warms up and absurd amount of warm up the better he gets and the better he gets in power production and the better he gets in speed and velocity. So his warm up prior to games is it's totally absurd. And just the more volume we throw at him the better he does. I have other folks. You get past like two or three reps and fatigue starts to set it. And now you're actually like reducing power production. So there is a ton of variation that goes in that. I can give you some guidelines though. You need to differentiate if you're training for speed power strength or a purge. Here's why. If we understand a little bit about what's causing the adaptation, that's going to tell you what you need to do or avoid. For example, volume is the primary driver in hypertrophy. Intensity is the primary driver in speed power and strength. All right, what that means is you need to preserve intensity for the first three you need to preserve volume in the second one at most. So if your warm up is so extensive in the hypertrophy training that it compromises your training volume because of fatigue. Even if it compromises the last set of the last exercise, then you're actually probably walking yourself backwards by doing that extensive. You would have been better off starting your first working set slightly self optimal. Right, because it's not really you're just trying to crew volume at that point. Strength and power is the opposite. Until you're moving very, very fast or powerfully, you're not really causing the adaptation. So there's no point in starting a working set until you're really basically at a hundred percent. So the warm up should be as long as it takes you to get to where your mobility is in the right spot like your joints feel good. You feel fresh, you feel activated and you really feel peak power anything before that is a warm upset in the sport of Olympic weightlifting. A lot of times the coaches will measure barbevel velocity. Travis Mash has done a fantastic job with this. He's got a lot of data. I'm it's called velocity based training. Brian Mann, Missouri and Miami tons of work here. And generally those communities are not going to count any repetition as a working set until you exceed 70 percent of your one-rette max. Where that's changed because of a lot of people doing the velocity based up is now they're basing that simply on and achieved velocity. And so really the warm up is irrelevant. They don't even pers- it's sort of just like do whatever you want and we're going to measure the barbevel until you actually hit an outcome. And now you're at what are working set. So different ways to think about it depending on what you're training for. That'll give you a little bit of a guideline. If you're training for anything passed by per trophy, then really and especially even hyper trophy. It just comes down to are you feeling ready to work? Are you cold? Are you moving through the correct positions? And if all those things are fine, I don't care if you start a little bit early and save some gas. And especially if you're a person like you who may be a bit more inclined to fatigue quickly, relative to Trevor who's just has no response to fatigue whatsoever. Is it useful to do more warm up at the beginning of a workout, say before the first exercise? And then once one has achieved both local and systemic warm up in our quotes, then perhaps on the second or third exercise, fourth exercise, et cetera, one or maybe even zero warm ups. Yeah, fair point. You only think about warm ups in a couple of ways. This is a really actually, this is a very clever question. You want to have some sort of general global warm up scheme. We tend to prefer dynamic warm ups. So this is whole body movements rather than like sitting and stretching. Static stretching things like that. So something that involves momentum. Yeah, momentum or movement, right? So this is like, Think about this in like old gym class. It's like your high knees and your butt kickers and just different things like that. Where you're moving in different planes, you're moving joints through tons of range of motion. You're getting a lot of movement there. So you're getting the local warm up. You're also getting the total systemic activation. Everything else is going on there. So that is what we'll be considered to be a general warm up. Five minutes is a very sufficient number. Perhaps 10 if you're a slow goer, achy and something's like that. And you really got to get the ankle warm up if you're doing lower body stuff. Really make sure that that's moving correctly. The hips and knees will follow upper body stuff really get the shoulder blades and the neck. Like making sure you're going there and the elbows will follow after that. So five to seven minutes of a general warm up. A lot of times like classic exercise science. It will even just put you on a bike cycling for five minutes. I don't like that personally. Dynamic movement is more preferred. If you really just move five to seven minutes, you'll be fine there. Now, specificity within each movement. It's very important that your first exercise that is generally the thing you've prioritized. That's often times the most important you're going to do for it. It oftentimes is also the most complex and the most moving parts. So it tends to be multi-joint. It tends therefore you need to have movement precision and skill dialed. You don't typically start your workouts off with the forearm curl. Like that's you don't need to tremendous amount of warm up to get going on that. You're going to start off with medicine ball throws or a snatch or some agility work. You need to have the whole system going because multiple joints are moving. Position matters technique. There's just a lot of skill requirement etc. So the individualized workout or the specific workout for the specific movement for that very first one. My general rule of thumb is like whatever it takes to move perfect in that first exercise. Pass that. You don't necessarily need to do individualized warm-ups for your next movements unless it is a movement you're trying to learn or just even get a little bit better at. I drop the load a little bit work on some accruing some practice reps fantastic. Or it's another dissimilar complex movement. So let's say your first exercise was a front squat and you got loader for that. And now you're going to move into a pull-up. But your mechanics aren't the best there. So you really need to change and do some maybe more specific activation warm-ups for that or something else. Or it's running or something totally different. So yeah, you don't need to re-warm up for every single exercise as you go. Jelly wants your good to go. The same muscles that you're going to use in the next exercise are warm. Same joints. Then you're good to go. You talked about intent within the movement. What about specific cadences for repetitions? Yeah. I was taught that one should lower the weight slowly. That's what called the eccentric portion of the movement. And then to try and explode the weight through the concentric phase. And then also make sure that one is using full range of motion and perfect form as it were. Now of course that is one tiny slice of the possible rep cadences and ways to approach. Resistance training. Although I think it's a pretty good one. Yeah. What are the general parameters sets that one needs to consider? You can imagine lifting four seconds concentric. Yes. For one pause for two. E-centrary. I realize there's an infinite number of variations here. Yeah. But is there a way to use rep cadence repetition cadence that is as a way to work through weak points and to be strong in every position of the movement? Yeah. A lovely question. I think the way I would like to answer this is maybe going back just to touch to get directly to that. So I think if we walk through power strength and hypertrophy and I hit you with the concepts that are specific to each one, that's going to lay out your answer because the most true answer there is it depends on the goal. The answer for what is optimal for strength is diametrically opposed for potentially what's optimized for hypertrophy. The same exact thing can be said for momentum. So we've classically heard things like this. Don't bounce at the bottom. You're cheating. So if you're doing a lot pull down or something, you don't bounce and rebound. You stop at the bottom. Slow down. All these things are thought to be trueisms of strength and conditioning. But guess what? Those are all trueisms assuming we're trying to grow muscle. That actually goes back to our conversation in episode one about a lot of things we think are just fundamental truths about strength training. Are just fundamental truths that came from the bodybuilding world. They're not wrong. They're good ideas. But there are other adaptations one needs to get from strength training that are not just maximizing muscle growth. So what I will lay out to you is a case for which you should bounce. A case for when you should go fast. A case for when you should be under control. All these things are different variables we can modify and get different adaptations for. Is there a way that you could lay out for us optimal repetition cadences for strength specifically versus high-perrophy specifically? Just to sort of book end the conversation and then migrate toward the middle in terms of replications is that would satisfy the desire to have a bit of both. We can get pretty close. Yeah. When you're talking about strength versus high-perrophy, remember strength is movement. High-perrophy is muscle size. That's the key to your answer here. So when you're trying to get stronger what you're effectively trying to do is get better at producing a certain amount of force through the movement. Now force is mass times acceleration. So what's the mass in the bar multiplied by how well I can accelerate it? Potentially going slower is only reducing acceleration. Right? So it's hard to argue that going slower is going to improve strength because you're simply reducing acceleration. So you need to practice lifting heavier at a faster rate. Now does that mean if you're trying to get stronger? There are no phases of your training which you'll slow down or not. Of course not. There are certain rules in different organizations where you have to pause the bottom. Like there's all kinds of little things like that. But in general, we want to think about what are we trying to do here? We're trying to get better at moving a heavier mass at a faster rate of acceleration. That is more force. That is more strength. High-perrophy is not that. The goal here is not a functional outcome. It is what is needed to cause the most amount of hypertrophy. And when you get to hypertrophy, then your optimal cadence is up to you. You can do any combination. In fact, you could do at the same exact cadence that you did your strength training with and get the same adaptations as if you modify the other variables appropriately. Or you could go slower. Or you could do pauses. Or you could do a thing that is called triphasic training. Where you spend the first phase, several weeks of your training, where you do e-centrics only. You're just lowering the bar and you're basically stopping. You can then do the next phase of your training with two zisometrics. You're just holding at that bottom position. And then the next phase you're training, you're focusing on the concentric. Portion of it. Try phasic one, two, three. E-centric, isometric, concentric. So that's a fantastic way of developing actually strength, a little bit of hypertrophy. But you're manipulating the variables in terms of how you execute the repetition rate. You can actually induce a lot of hypertrophy moving the weight fast. I just mentioned even down so in a control. Now, one thing we'll never advocate is moving any sort of weight or load uncontrolled. The assumption here when I'm single fast is you're always in control. I never want you bouncing and crushing your sternum with a barbell after it does. But you can move at a lot of rates. You can the isometric I mentioned because this is when things like body weight training come into play. Absolutely you can gain strength and even a little bit of hypertrophy, especially in the upper body. Having isometric is much harder to do this with a lower body. You just, you outrun that coverage really quickly. You need load. But there's a lot of ways. This is also probably why people have done things like gone to yoga only. Or Pilates or some of these things that are body weight based and there's no external load and they've actually increased muscle size. So I'm getting the picture there are a ton of options in terms of rep cances. However, can we say that one should pick a given rep cadence within an exercise rather than changing it from set to set within an exercise or that one should perhaps even pick at certain rep cadence for an entire workout? Suspecting that your answer is going to be it depends. Yeah, it is. But if, you know, I'm not going to use that if you had a gun to your head kind of situation. But if you had a gun to your head, what would be the rep cadence that you would prescribe for strictly strength or as much strength with as little hyper-confries possible? And in picking that rep cadence, then it therefore has to thread throughout the entire exercise bout. So you're actually right. You can, because of that undulating periodization stuff I talked about, you can actually do this in a lot of ways. So you could do one exercise at the beginning where you have a set cadence, say a 3-1-1, is like a very one. That's, so that's lifting for 3, pause for 1, lower for 1. Generally the opposite. Okay, so the first number is always the eccentric. Generally. Okay, so lowering the weight for a count of 3, pause for 1. Totally different. Like a deadlift starts, concentric and finishes the eccentric, but a bench press starts the opposite. Okay, so start to finish. Start to finish is the better way to think about it. Yeah, so in, I'll clarify actually. And we say 3-1-1, we're generally talking about almost always the eccentric is the slower portion. Regardless if it's the first or the last, right? So whether you're doing a bench press with the eccentric is lowering the bar to your chest, that's the first part of the movement. One, two, three, pause one, one up, which means accelerate as hard as you can the way up. That's what you describe. Right, as opposed to say a row, a row which is actually going to be starting off concentric. So you're going to be pulling that thing to your chest as fast as you can under control, not slamming off your chest. Holding for one second and then taking three seconds to lower back on the rack or on the ground or whatever. So the reason we do that is somewhat intuitive, but it is, again, to make sure you're not advancing a bar or an implement onto your physical body at an extremely fast rate. That's very difficult to deal with. So a 3-1-1 is a very standard strength protocol that is something you can just run with. It's that's all you ever wanted to do, it'd be absolutely fine. Lower the bar for account to a 3. It actually ends up being approximately 3-8. It is super hardly anybody is counting off seconds precisely. I suppose it's doable, but then pausing briefly. Yep. And that brief is almost, that pause is almost unmeritable. It is simply, are you under control before you transition from the center to concentric or conceptoring? It's just the safety thing. So once you feel down, you've reached complete range of motion or ready to transition, just go. You don't really need to go like 1, and then go up it. It's just making sure, again, we don't slam weights off of body parts. And that final one in the 3-1-1 is really fast. The execution of the usually concentric portion of the exercise. Yep, it's fast as you pause to be kept. Okay, so that would be for the majority of the outcome being strength. Yep. And of course, we should acknowledge, again, there are a ton of variations that one could implement there. But that would be a good starting place. On the opposite side, for somebody who's mainly interested in hypertrophy, what would be the rep cadence that if you had a gun to your head, that you would prescribe. I would probably do the exact same thing, but I would make the last number two. So 3-1-2. You could also just keep 3-1 on. It is still very fine, even the exploding on the contrary is still highly effective for training hypertrophy. If you want to keep it super simple and just make rep cadence not very well that you play with, because you have other ones to move, that's great. If you want to add a little bit of time to the concentric phase, fine, it's not going to make enough of a difference for most people if you were to really worry about. I guess that's sort of the point I really want to make. This is a classic example of we're deep into a method. If you'd long as you hit the concept, I talked about earlier whether you want to do 3-1-1-3-2-3-3-3-3-3 tri-phase. This is just a method choice. It doesn't mean they're irrelevant. There are subtle changes within them. It's just 80-20 rule, right? 80% of the benefit is going to be from the concept. 20% is this small thing. If you're super into this field or you actually want to work with a qualified coder or something, there's lots of reasons to play with this. If you're just on your own here and running this thing, 3-1-1 is fine. Everyone to totally find anything like that. You really just want to make sure that in the strength side of the equation, you're under control and you can add enough load to stimulate strength and not to hurt with an acute trauma. On the hypertery side, you're just wanting to load enough to where you can hit volume. Because you've got to put it on there. If you want to go lighter, if you want to go slower, fine. You go slower in your repetition, so maybe even like a 5-second eccentric, a 2-second pause, a 3-second rise. That's great. You can actually then stimulate the same amount of my perchery and either do it with less weight or do it with less repetitions. It's a variable you can play with if you're like, hey, I don't have enough weights at my house or I only have a kettlebell or a dumbbell. How am I going to stimulate hypertrophy? You're only option is really doing more reps. Well eventually that train runs pretty shallow. Okay, here's the thing you can play with. Maybe just add time under tension. This is what we're calling, right? Just do slower repetitions. Go longer ones and hold it. It's a variable that we used to individualize programs rather than something that you should really be focused on. It's like a core aspect that's going to be driving whether or not your program works. It's just a tool we can play with in the what-if scenarios. I will use this stuff a lot when I'm traveling. You can do a tremendous workout in your hotel room just doing like a 10 second eccentric, a 10 second hold, a 10th centric concentric. Yeah, I've had some decent hotel room workouts. They're not my preference, but by simply doing things like 10 second lowering handstand push-up against the door. Totally. Obviously assisted for me. I can't do a free handstand push-up. I just don't have the skill. We're going to strengthen both. We can do some sort of configured dips between the beds or chairs in this kind of thing. Real bit of a split squats are great to do in hotels, but you're back foot up on a bed and get an amazing split squat workout done. Yeah, a lot of glue pranks. Lots of something to do there. Yeah, and with that jump rope, if you've ever heard someone jumping in the morning, yeah, may or may not have been me. It could be any number of things, but I know to skip rope in hotel rooms. Not to get overly detailed, but I think there are going to be a number of people. Wondering about how to breathe during repetitions and how to breathe in between sets. So I'd like to just briefly touch on this, and this is something that I know we're going to return to again when we have our discussion about recovery. But is there a general rule of thumb for how to breathe during repetitions during work? Yep. For strength, maybe even strength versus hypertrophy in a way that maximizes oxygen input to the system, keeps you alert and conscious, but that also protects the body by creating some rigidity in the system. Because certainly being deep with all your exhale, the body is a very different beast in terms of stability than with the body full of air versus breathing during the repetition movement. There's a maneuver that is long been labeled the Vosalva technique. So what that really means is you're trying to use air to create intribedominal pressure. And what you're really trying to do is create a cylinder around your spine. The real issue you have to play here is regulation of blood pressure and spinal stability. Now you should be able to breathe and brace. What I mean by that is you should be able to create total intribedominal pressure, regulate spine control, while breathing. It's just very hard for a lot of people to do. It's a skill you should absolutely work on. You can actually do this and you can go around like I do this trick in class and students can come and push any part of my entire abdomen and it's super tight and I can talk. Now it's going to be a little bit labor, you can hear a little bit of a difference, but you should be able to do that. If you have to like punch down and you can't even muster breath and it takes that to create pressure, you're not actually, you don't really understand the abdominal control necessary to create that stability. So step number one is that's the goal. Now with the blood pressure thing, we have to be careful because a standard blood pressure ideally, if we sat around right now, it was probably something like 120 over 80, a stoic versus a die stoic. That's a normal number, right? High blood pressure is something over that. Well, with an acute bout of exercise, you can see that number reaches highs like 450 over 350, which effectively means you have total blood occlusion, right? Your blood pressure is so high blood is not moving anywhere. And so in the middle of a very heavy set, especially complex movements, especially when they're loaded on your body. This could be an overhead press or squat variations, and like that. Blood pressure is going to be a problem. And the reason why that matters is that's what's going to make you pass out. It's not the fact that you ran out of oxygen in three seconds. It's the fact that blood pressure got so high, you blocked out. And so we want to have to play this game of releasing a little bit of the pressure so we can actually get blood to move a little bit, making sure that we don't lose spinal stability so we can finish our workout. That's really the question you asked. How do I play this game of, oh, I have several hundred pounds on my back or my chest? And I don't want to exhale, right? So that I don't lose spinal stability, but at the same time, I don't want to pass out, right, which is a problem. So kind of a couple of rules with them. If you're going to be doing something in which you can complete the entire exercise without a breath, and it is a maximal or close to load, that's probably your best strategy. So in that particular case, you'll see a lot of breathing techniques where you're going to take a very large inhale. Ideally, this is done through the abdomen, not the shoulders. So we shouldn't see in clavicles rising during this thing. You'll see a common mistake of the bars on their back and you see people do this like big inhale thing and all they do is elevate their clavicles. That's not necessarily going to increase pressure through the abdomen, which is what you're looking for. So you want to be thinking about belly moving out in all four areas in front of you to your left and right and to your back. That's that quadrant sort of idea of stabilizing your spine. You can do that independent of your clavicles moving. Your shoulders don't need to rise for that. You don't really need the oxygen for a metabolic purposes. You're just using the air for a brace. That's really all you're after. So you're trying to visualize your torso as more or less a cylinder. And you're trying to fill it with air, the logic being that if I were to push down on to say a full unopened can of soda, water, it's probably sugar fobes out there. And then push as hard as I could. It's going to be hard for me to crush that can. But if the can were empty or if it were a little bit kinked in the middle, correct. Then I could likely crush that can. Yeah, what you're really doing is you have your spinal records in the back, right? And then a whole series of abdominal exercises. And you actually have some neural control, systematic control of contracting those. But you don't have muscles on the inside that you can do. So you're basically bringing an air and saying, I'll use air to push from the inside out and I'll use muscles to push from the outside in to create this brace. And I don't want over compression with the muscles. This is a, I could view, if you see people that have just enormous spinal records. Sometimes that's an indicator of actually a poor breathing or bracing strategy. Because they're using spinal records to create all the compression and not actually using the inside or not. That's not always the case, but sort of like a thing to think about. So over compression through the spinal records is not necessarily ideal. If you want the best scenario is a little bit of a brace of both. So you use some air to push this side, you use some muscles to press that way. And then that, that spine is this nicely held in position. Again, not in position where I've locked on my diaphragm and I can't get any air out. I should be able to get that brace pattern and then be able to speak. In fact, like I'm doing it right now. And you'll see like a little bit of, you can, if you're really paying attention to my voice, you can hear a little bit of the subtle difference. But I should be able to do this for quite a long time. Right? I could take a maximum rep right here in this position, whether I'm over at pressing, doing some sort of row like anything and feel very brazed in the entire quadrant. This is very helpful. I'm going to work on it, but can we say that an effective way to start off in terms of breathing during repetitions would be to take a gulp of air during the lowering phase. The eccentric phase and then to exhale during the concentric exertion phase. I asked that because that's what I've been doing for a while and it makes me feel safe. I don't know if I am and it allows me to exhale as I exert the hardest portion of the exercise. Yep. And perhaps I also borrowed that from martial arts where one tends most often is trying to exhale on the on the strike. Yep. If you're going to be doing again, the number of repetitions can be completed without a breath. A lot of the times you're better off saving that exhalation until you complete. Wow, but if you don't have to. But for a reasonably heavy set of hacksquats or even leg extensions and giving that I already can't leg extension my body weight. Maybe this is the average. Maybe this is why. The idea of holding my breath for an entire compound set. So again, I'm going to mind, you know, like where is my insurance card who's going to drive me to the hospital. It's kind of thing. In all seriousness, what if I want to breathe during this set? Yeah. So I'll clarify. I'm generally meaning if you're doing like a one-ret backs or something like that. Okay. So it's certainly like going to hold my breath for a one-ret position maximum. That, you know, maybe like a double or something like that, depending on what you're doing, like maybe a triple, a bench breath you can probably do three and get away with it. It's squat, it gets harder. That left. So it kind of depends on the exercise. We want to take that breath, breath the prior to the eccentric portion. Not during. So breathe in, lock or set, and now start our movement pattern wherever it's going to be. Exhaling on the concentrated portion during it is fine. It's no problem. Especially if you're not extremely heavy. And what are your thoughts on grunting and screaming? Yeah, fine. I don't care. I don't tend to do that. I'm occasionally known to squeal or whimper. But I do it very quietly. I think if you're in a think squeal, we'll be absolutely. Thanks. If you're going to be doing multiple repetitions, what we actually do for the NFL combine is we teach them a very specific Excel strategy. So there's one test that they do, which is they bench press 225 pounds for as many reps as possible. A lot of these people will get 25 to 40 repetitions. So we have a very specific breathing pattern. It would be something like if we think that they're going to do around 25 reps. Say that's like our goal. We might say, okay, do the first 10 without a breath. And then exhale, reset and then do five breath. And then you might do five breath, three breath, two breath. And then one breath per rep until we can't get anymore. So we'll have very specific strategies for them. So what I would say is think about how many you're going to complete. And then breathe according to that. And it tends to increase in frequency as the number gets closer to failure. Because you're going to want that that error a little bit. But you just want to make sure that when you're breathing back in, you're in a safe spot. So you don't want to be catching that like re-breath when the weights on you. You want to be in a locked-out position or away from you when you're standing. So it tends to be like at the end of the exercise, not in the middle of it, which is going to be a recipe of problems if you take your breath then. One of the reasons I'm so happy to have you here, having this discussion is we can really get into the weeds, but also hit a number of questions that I hear a lot. How does one contend with the first attempt at a lift not working out? Is it too heavy? Something goes wrong. Hopefully not injury promoting wrong, but something goes wrong. Do you count that? Do you reset the workout? And then the counterpart to that question is, what do you do if it's too easy when wrong? Because you didn't put enough weight on the bar. You don't pick up a heavy enough set of dumbbells. Do you abandon the set and replace it with another? I guess this is really a question of how much margin for error is there in volume? Yep. When doing this three by five program? Sure. Two things that I like to start with. Number one is, I talked about linear predization and underulating predization. There's actually a new model, new-ish model called auto-regulation, which basically says you're going to go in today and depending on any number of biomarkers, performance markers, or your performance, you will adjust your training based on how you're feeling that day. And so 70% is not maybe, for example, not necessarily 70% of your one-armament repetition max, highest ever. It's 70% of what you can connect with you do that day. And so it actually allows you to auto-regulate your training based on actually what's happening. And so you don't have to have as much long-term planning in your program design because it'll sort of figure itself out as you're going. You can use velocity to determine this auto-regulation. You can use actually this, like, taking it up to close to a max with a day and then basing all your percentages on that daily max or a lot of different ways. So that is actually one of very effective strategy. And there's a lot of research coming out of auto-regulation. There's a lot of different ways to do it. So that's one thing to say. Another thing to say is this, 3 to 5. It depends on if we're going for speed power or strength because, while all those other variables are the same for 3 to 5, the core difference between whether that is a power workout or a strength workout is the load. Right? So if you are at a moderate load, say 30% of your 1 repetition max up to about 70%. That's going to be a power based adaptation, assuming you're going with high intent. Can you, sorry, I have to interrupt, maybe just clarify what intent is. Yeah, you're attempting to move the implement or go through the movement pattern as fast as you can. Great. Thank you. If you're trying to go for strength and you're below 70%, you're not really going to be improving strength because the total mass is not heavy enough. And so really when we say strength, we're assuming you're at at least generally 70% or higher. Now, if you're new to training, totally different thing, right? But if you're moderately trained to highly trained, you're going to be in the way on north of 70%. So I think below that, we don't really count anyways. Those are warm upsets, basically. Right. So one thing to actually give you some very specific numbers here. And I don't have all of these members who can perhaps provide a chart later or send out something to them. But there's a chart that you can look up called a prolopen chart. How do you spell it? P R I L I P I N. And there's actually been a few studies on it. It's been old. It's been around for a very long time. It's sort of in the coaching realm. Not a handful of studies out of New Zealand came out verifying and validating a lot of it. But what it did effectively does is, if strength is the goal, and this comes from the power lifting weight lifting, sort of communities, sort of optimizing for strength, then how much time do I need to spend at each intensity range? So 70% 80% 90% etc. Because specificity is going to say this. If you want to get better, neuromusk their guy, at shooting a basketball, the most important thing you could ever do is shoot a basketball. Under the exact circumstances that you're going to do it, right? Specificity always wins. If you want to get better at strength, the most important thing you need to do is that exact movement at that load. And in this case, if you want to get better at your bench press, lifting at 100% of your max on a bench press is the most specific thing you could ever do. The more you can do that, the faster you will increase your bench press max. However, that's very hard to do without getting hurt. It's also not addressing what I call your defender. So if the reason you can't bench press higher than whenever you're benching now, it may not be your pure strength. That may be any number of things like, you don't have enough muscle or technique or things. Okay, great. So specificity over here. Variation on the other side. So we're playing this game we've talked about of, how do I make sure that I can have enough specificity in my training without leading to overuse entry? How do I maximize or how do I reduce my chance of injury while getting enough specificity? And so we have a classic paradigm over here. One actually training protocol you can look up is called a Bulgarian method. And the Bulgarians were amazing at the sport of Olympic weightlifting. Probably the patriotic of this entire thing recently passed away. I've been a bit, I be a J.V. Now, Niam Simumonaglu, Pocket Hercules, one of the greatest way left of all time, came out of the system. And they do a lot of things. But one example in the Bulgarian system is you're going to do a one repetitions, maximum snatch. You're going to take a little bit of a break. You'll do a one repetition maximum clean and jerk. Take a little bit of a break. Do a one repetition maximum front squat. Take a little bit of a break. And you're going to repeat that two to three times a day every day. That's specificity, right? Those people get extraordinarily strong. Now, they don't do that all year round. They don't do that with all their lifters. But this is when we're trying to peak for a major competition like the Olympics. We are going so far into specificity. And that was very counter to the Russian system at the time, which is much more of our classic periodization, sort of a pro. Okay, specificity is tremendous. But in doing that, the Bulgarians just brutalize a lot of athletes, right? Because it's very difficult to handle something like that. And you can't really do that that long without getting wrecked. They're in there. The goal is to win medals. The goal is to with it's a totally different thing than long jeopardy out of here, right? Like we're trying to push the boundaries of horse-setic changes. Unless someone has a naturally balanced physique. You know, general, if people do one sort of movement, I find that they tend to resemble the equipment that they did that movement with over time. Right. That was a joke against kettlebells. Of course, of course, of course. I got it. So we know specificity is technically optimal, but it's not realistic. Not for that kind of a, you know, a extreme situation. So how do we balance these things? Well, that turns out this prillipenture gives you guidelines for how much time, and by time, I mean, how many repetitions to stand in each of these rep ranges so that you get kind of the best of this world. You're going to find the same thing by the way when we get it in endurance training. There's only so much training you can do at 95% of your heart rate. Before it starts to become quite detrimental, you need to actually spend a lot of time at those lower intensities. So the prillipenture walks you through how many sets, and it gives you a range. Like, like, I think that the bottom of it is like, how much time you spend at like 60 to 70% of everyone are at max. And it says like, you know, minimum of this set to maximum of this set, but the ideal number of reps per set per week is like 18. And then it walks you through. And so there's four criteria on it. I think it's 55 to 65% again, how many reps there? It's like 3 to 6 reps per set. Um, 18 to 30 reps total. And I think the ideal rep range is like 24. Something like that. So it gives you 55 to 65, 70 to 80, 80 to 90 in the 90 plus percent. What you'll see is the 90 plus percent number is more like one to two reps per set for a total of about seven total repetitions. If you start cruising past that, um, other bad things start to creep up in there. So that's a really effective chart. What it really highlights though is even somebody who's trying to maximize strength. You're going to spend something like 35 or so percent of your training time between this like 55 to 65 percent range. So you're asking her like, well, do I even count that one? The answer is, yeah, you know, in that range, if it's below 55 to 60%, you probably don't count it. Now again, some coaches don't count on us. It's even about 70. Fine. It's not a major distinction. But you're going to spend the bulk of your time, you know, accumulating some, some technique basically and skill and tissue tolerance. Very important. Um, then next step up is like 28 percent. I think is sort of the cut off of how much time you spend, um, between 70 and 80 percent. Everyone at max and then it jumps down like 23 percent and then all the way to 70 percent. So you can walk yourself through that and that gives you an extremely good guideline. And you'll notice all of these are still in the 3 to 5 range. It's just really, you're manipulating it by total sets or telelectresizes. So that can give you some instruction to play with. We will provide a link to the Prilapin chart. Yeah. In the show note captions. Training to failure when the goal is strength. Yeah. Should one do it? Should one avoid it? Or does it depend? Well, yeah, it always depends. Um, the way that I'll generate say it is because of what we just outlined in the Prilapin chart. You don't have to go to failure to see strength bands. Especially early or even moderate. And I'm talking maybe five plus years in your lifting career. Would you um call beginner zero to five years of training intermediate five to 20 years of training? Yeah, something like that. And then advance would be people that really put the time and energy into fine tuning their program. The vast majority people who think their advanced art are really what we call it, our media. In all domains of life. Fair. Even as a scientist. Yeah, it's quite rare to reach that number of events. So I actually don't have any problem going to failure quite often. I'm also fine with people who don't want to go all the way there. You can get most of what you need getting what we call technical failure. So this is like, okay, that was really challenging. Boy, you started to have some breakdowns of technique. We're going to call that good. The only exception here I want to point out is people who are either novice or beginners. They really have no concept of what 100% means. And so I think it's actually very fruitful to take them to 100%. Just to give them a guideline of where it's at. Now, of course, do this on exercises that they are comfortable with or close and that you maybe that maybe this is on a machine, maybe this is single joint movements or whatever it takes for them to have confidence. But I actually, I don't think you should be scared of these. They're not really um that much more dangerous than anything else. And you think about it. If you're going to do a front squat or any exercise and your 100 max is 200 pounds. Is it really that much more dangerous to do one try at 200 or five pounds than it is to do five tries at 190 pounds? Is it really that much more? No, like it's not. So you can do like we talked about in the first episode. You can do a repetition max estimate. When you get to like 85 to 95% of where you think you are. And then instead of adding load, you just do as many reps as you can. Google that number and then I'll tell you the conversion and estimate of what your own RMAX is. That's fine. But also I have absolutely no issue. In fact, I generally encourage it to take people up to that level. Certainly not day one or anywhere close to that. But at some point with let's see what you actually got. I'm just I'm just going to cut it off early. What I'm going to consider to be one at max, anything more than a minor technical breakdown is for that crew. We're going to stop and call that good. And ideally with a spotter, especially bench pressing, don't bench press alone in your basement kind of thing. A few people die each year from bench pressing alone in their basement. Yep. Or use dumbbells if you're going to do that. Yeah. Hard harder to die using dumbbells. Suppose you could drop them on your head or something, but not get stuck under them. Exercise selection and frequency of exercise implementation across the week. So I can imagine with this three by five routine done three to five times per week. You can imagine changing up the exercises every workout. Although considering that most of these three by five routines are going to be done with compound movements. Yeah. Hi. Sooner or later one runs out of movements if the goal is to hit major, all the major muscle groups. Yeah. Yeah. However, let me give an example and ask if it's okay. Two, for instance, do the three by five routine where one of the exercises for back is a bent over row. You do that on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Okay. You know, I can imagine one could do that and still recover and improve over time. But five days a week, bent over rows five days a week. Is that okay? I mean, it can one still progress. And there I could imagine it's a strong answer of depends because some people recover more slowly. And others, I'm very comfortable doing hitting muscle groups once directly per week and once indirectly. That's worked for me far better than two or three times per week. You know, I get, you know, looks of sympathy when I say this, but it's actually, it's just how my physiology works. Kind of. Yeah. Well, and maybe I'm not optimizing a number of different features. The point being that some people really do seem to be able to train it a muscle every day and still make progress. Other people seem to have trouble when they train a muscle every day. So how does one establish exercise selection when the goal is to make progress? And this brings up something very important. And we're going to have a whole episode about this. But local versus systemic recovery. Yep. That, you know, is the whole nervous system becoming fatigued? And is the muscle group and the related muscular skeletal systems coming for ticked? We're going to go back to thinking about when you make these comments about, uh, it takes you three to five days and you've got better results in there. The assumption that you're probably running under is your training style is more reflecting that recovery time than it is your physiology. It's not you. It's how you're training. If you look at, uh, again, all the Olympic weight lifters that are competing, they're going to be squatting or some variation of squatting every day. That's going to happen. Like, a lot of the times you're training multiple times a day. And they will be doing some basically barbell full squat multiple times a day every day, six days a week. You know, something like that. They're the best in the world that getting powerful. They're tremendously good at getting strong. You can do it, right? It comes down to what does your volume look like, what type of movements are you doing? What rep range, what overall volume, are you hitting? And how are you doing it? If you look at athletes, they train their legs every day. When they're running around, they're doing speed agility training every single day. They don't need, you know, three days to recover. Can you imagine a basketball player trying to ask for like three days to recover between practice? Right. Well, to be fair as you, as you chuckle at me. I'm doing other things on the intervening days. Yeah. So I'll train a muscle group like legs. And then I'll give it four days before I do an indirect. Yeah. What I call an indirect exercise for legs, which for me would be sprinting. Yep. Then it gets two days and then I'm training them again. But then the last and out they'd have to do that every day. Right. So the answer is you absolutely can train any of these muscles every single day. It really comes down to volume. Right? And it comes down to movement type. And how are you getting it? So within the case of weight lifters and athletes, what we tend to see happen is there's not a, there's two things. There is a long period of conditioning. And I don't mean endurance. What I mean is tissue tolerance and conditioning. So they're not going to start off their career at that pace. Right? Their career might start off at five days a week. But maybe every other of those days is a PVC pipe only. And you're just training the movement patterns. You're working on technique, et cetera. And then eventually maybe after six months or a year, those PVC pipe days turn into barbell only days. And so now you went from a pound to forty five pounds. And eventually as your years go on that, that wraps yourself. So it depends on the style in general speed and power stuff. It's so light. It almost requires because it's non-peteeking. It requires almost no recovery. So if you were truly doing say like, you know, when you say you it's funny because when you say I do legs on Mondays, you don't even realize it. But an athlete does legs every day. But you're saying legs and what you're really saying is I do high-perchemy legs Mondays. Pretty much that I don't want to get into what I do specifically because it's less important than what other people choose to implement. But the repetition range is anywhere from four to 12. Correct. So you're coming up pretty. Yeah. You're smack dead in the peak-sorness longest recovery range. Volume is relatively low intensity. It's very, very high. Yeah. Workouts are very, very sure. So if you were to switch that and you were to stay under four repetitions, higher quality, higher rest in between them, I would be willing to bet a larger amount of money that you'd be fine the next day. Certainly, 48 hours. And if you were to actually go way lower and keep, you know, 3 to 5, I keep it very, very light and transfer speed. You would have absolutely no issue the next day. So it really comes down to a function of training. You're right in that hypertrophy zone, which is something that you probably need 40 hours at minimum to recover from. Because what you won't see are bodybuilders, training the same muscle group on multiple days, like very often. At most it will be indirect, but generally they're not going to do that every single day. The same reason. So you're training in that cell. That's what it's going to take to recover. If you trained in a different cell, then it wouldn't take that long to recover. So for the person starting out, would you recommend they pick three to five exercises and stick with those so that they can get their skill and movement and positioning and breathing all that really dialed in and then start to experiment by varying one or two of those exercises over time? That's great. If you look at the conjugate model, so these are the strongest power lifters as a collective group that ever existed. What they're very good at is they keep almost the exact same weekly structure, but they make a very small change in exercise variation. So for example, say Wednesday is bench day. They're going to always bench on Wednesdays, but maybe this week they're going to do close grip bench. Then maybe next week it's going to be a special type of barbell. Then maybe the week after that it's maybe they'll change the range of motion a little bit. So it's actually the exact same exercise when they're making a very small variation. In that change alone allows them to do enough specificity, but also gives them enough variation where it's not the exact same stimuli in the exact same spot over and over and over and over. And that's what allows that group plus lots of other assistance. But as for allows that group to train very, very, very heavy, very consistently, and not have to worry about too much planning for a pair of decision and other stuff like that. They get their back off by making small variations in exercise. I will say a major mistake folks do make is they change our exercises entirely way too often. If I were to have to pick one or the other, I would say don't change anything on your exercises for six weeks. Probably really sick maybe even 10, the 12 weeks. And then you can make some changes. You should not be changing every single week. You're not going to see progress. It's going to be very difficult to do that. So it's going to take you three weeks generally to figure out the group, the exercise, to figure out how well you can load it. What's too much where you woke up unbelievably sore, that was a train wreck. How much do I load it at? What position how long is this going to take? It's going to take you three or so weeks. And then you can really start pushing there. So changing it before that or in that time frame is you're not going to be able to progress to be overload because you're just not going to know exactly where you're at on all the exercises. So it's very important to create standardization within them and then see some progress in a movement or muscle group whatever you're going for and then make some changes. So before we dive into our discussion about hypertrophy, we just get a brief recap of the general parameters for an excellent power and strength training program. Okay, let me hit you with these rapid fire and you can maybe come ask questions along that. Remember those modifiable variables. Okay, so let's go through them in order and then what they mean specifically for power versus strength. So modifiable variable number one is called choice. So which exercises do I select for strength? In general for power or speed or strength, we want to select compound movements. You don't often see people doing maximum strength work for like a tricep kickback. Right? It's typically multiple joint movements and typically complex movements. In selecting these compound movements, we generally want to actually think about exercise selection of movements rather than muscle groups. So this is an important distinction because we'll see this is a different answer when we get type per tripe. What I mean by that is when we think about again strength training, we tend to think about bodybuilding concepts. We go to the gym and we do things like I got to make sure I get my chest today and I got to make sure I get my hamstrings and now you're selecting exercises based on a muscle you want to work for strength development and power we want to think about movements rather than individual muscle groups. So there should be like things like I need to train explosive hip extension which is like a vertical jump or something like that. I want to train pushing or pulling movements. I want to train rotation which is a whole area we haven't gotten into which is very important for overall health and wellness longevity. So we want to select big movements by the muscle, the movement patterns that we want to introduce and we just want to select a reasonable balance between these. I don't care what the exact ratio is. You just don't want to go an entire six months without doing anything in this rotational area or an entire eight to ten weeks without doing something with that's a lower body hinge. So any number of examples there. So just think about the rough movement patterns upper and lower push and pull and then some sort of rotation. That puts you in a pretty good spot. If you're using three by five method and you're going to pick as little as three exercises just pick one from each one of those pick a rotation pick a push a pick a pull. I can easily think of a push in a pull. So for example bench presser shoulder press row or chin for pull and then squat or deadlift for hinge. What would be a good example of a quality rotational movement? Yeah so anytime you can use a cable machine like at the gym and you can do it's kind of hard to describe the exercise but basically you're going to stand facing the cable and you're going to pull it towards yourself and then rotate like you're pivoting like your either swing angle golf club or hitting a baseball bat. So you're facing one direction I'm facing you right now. I'm pulling the cable towards myself and then I'm going to spend doing 180 degree pivot and face exactly away from you when I finish and then return it back in that same spot. So that's a rotation. Great we will provide a link to an example of that that you consider a quality example. A medicine ball throw any number of things like this are a great rotational exercise. All right so we select your exercises based on that. We generally then because that is the case we don't worry about things like eccentric versus concentrate because you're doing a whole body athletic movement which the eccentric concentric portion is going to be folded into that and you really can't separate them out. So that's exercise choice our first variable. The next one is exercise order so because that everything driving power and strength is quality based you want to do these at the beginning of your workout you would not want to do anything for taking before this. So no cardiovascular training, no other repetition of failure stuff if you do those before and now you're slower all you've done is practice getting slower. And so these need to be done when you're fresh. You also need to do them when you're very fresh because they're the most neurologically demanding. They're complicated. They tend to have multiple steps and they're often in multiple plans and coordination is a difficult thing and if you're trying to do all that at maximum speed you're nervous to need to be tremendously fresh. And so any amount of fatigue here is only going to compromise results. To kind of recap that one of the major mistakes when training for strength and especially power is people worry way too much about fatigue. Those things should not be part of the equation. In fact if they are that's a very good sign you're not doing this correctly. These are non-futiging movements especially speed and power. So choice order is next. The next one after that is volume and we sort of hit volume and intensity which is the other one. We talked about that. The volume is basically identical between power and strength. The general number we're going to look at here is something like three to twenty sets total per workout per workout but that would be like twenty would be a little bit of a special case. Three to five is what I told you earlier right? I'm just saying like sometimes you can actually go quite higher in this case. But that's the general range. And one somebody finishes the three by five workout for power or strength. If they decide they want to throw in some calf raises and curls and totally have forearm work or a little bit of jogging on the treadmill or something that's okay. Absolutely. There is you have very little risk of interference for things like speed and power. Strength you have a little bit of a risk only because now you're introducing fatigue which if you're really pushing strength that might compromise recovery. I could imagine doing the three to five routine for strength or for power and then somebody finishing up with 10 or 15 minutes of high-purchar free arm work and then being very seriously compromised if they try and come in the next day or even the next day. Correct. And do those big compound movements for speed and power. That's right. Not just because they're sore but the muscles may actually still be damaged. And I know later we're going to talk about the somewhat tenuous relationship between soreness and recovery. Yep. So that's a really nice heuristic to pay attention to is you can but just be careful. Energy starts a matter at that point. If you're really truly trying to maximize strength you would do nothing at all outside of that training. If you're just like I kind of want to get stronger and some other things and you're willing to lose strength you know five percent of your strength gains then you're totally fine. The same can be said by the way for supersetting. So supersetting is an idea that says like wait a minute. You're telling me dude I gotta take five minutes in between each set. Well that's not so much a problem nowadays with phone. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Smartphones because people are filling their inter-set intervals with social media and texting. You don't really have to go that long. In fact there was actually a study that came out in the last month that showed you know like really two minutes is probably sufficient for most people. Having said that if you really are trying to push maximum strength that update. So like three to five is very very reasonable. You're those training sessions are long because you have to take your spending more time not doing anything than you are doing something. But you're trying to maximize quality. So that's a sort of like part and parcel. If you're not super worried about it you can actually do supersetting which is let's imagine again you're going to do some some lunges. And while your legs are wrestling doing their three to five minutes you can go over and do an upper body row or pull. And when your upper body is wrestling you're going back the legs. So that really cuts your time in half. Is it ideal? No. We actually ran a study maybe 10 years ago in our lab and we looked at that specifically and we did see a reduction in strength performance in the supersetting group relative to the group who do not superset. The question then it becomes like isn't enough for you to care. So if you were to if I were to say hey I can cut an hour off of your workout time but you will lose 5% of your strength gain almost everyone would take that exchange. With the accepting of people who are getting close to competition or really trying to set a new lifetime PR or something then you might say no. I don't want any interference there that last little margin is what I care about give me the extra rest. Great. So it's not it doesn't work. It's always a what are you willing to give up versus get the practicalities of supersetting or staggering push pull push pull in my mind are real because you have to take over large segments of the gym which oftentimes leads to a situation where your rest times are too long or highly variable because people are working in. Or you can't finish your set because someone jumped in in the machine. Right. Totally screwed. You use three to five of your friends because it's obnoxious when you're taking over all the equipment but in all seriousness I think it's wonderful if you have the space and the format to do it but at least in my experience and observation these people know who they are. It's not practical to do on a regular basis if you train an open commercial gym. Yeah tough to pull off. So we've covered choice order, volume, an intensity to a sufficient level. The last one is frequency and we've already sort of indirectly talked about that where frequency can be as high as you'd like in this area it really depends on your recovery. If you really truly pushing maximum strength you probably do need a few days to recover although that's definitely not a point in your book. So being power can be done multiple times a day almost every day basically. The one exception would be maximum sprinting speed. You need to be careful there for things like hamstring and especially if you're pretty fast. So you want to be a little bit but if you're doing easier movements like medicine ball throws or kettlebell swings or something you could do those quite often as long as the volume is staying pretty low. Last little piece here is progression. How do I progress over time? So I mentioned this earlier but just want to fill this gap right back in before we head over to hypertrophy which is 3 to 5 percent increase per week of intensity in general and you can do upwards of about 5 percent increase in volume per week over time and I generally recommend running that for at longest eight weeks but probably most realistically you want to go about five weeks or so and then have some sort of a d-load or back off week. If you do that you're generally going to be a pretty good spot. So those are like the core concepts. Now there's a whole bunch of fun methods you can play with within all these categories and I would like to actually cover just a couple of them if we've got a little more space for that. Sure I'd love to hear about those. I'd like to also just queue up one which is while I joked about people texting and doing social media between sets and I- That's not a joke. Well I confess I stop bringing my phone into the gym because of the urge to you know take my mind off of the workout and I just started enjoying my workouts a lot more and the workouts go far better that way and there there's just much more efficient for me I realize that some people their careers take place in the gym and so for that I don't look down upon anyone using their phone at the gym but that really tends to help me but I do wonder whether or not there's an optimal behavior or mindset in between sets. I've heard before that pacing around can actually help diffuse some of the lactate and other metabolic byproducts of work and exertion that can lead to better performance. I've also heard that shaking the muscles out. There's all sorts of gym lore about this but maybe there's also some decent science. I'm just curious if you have any specific recommendations that people could play with or try. Yep so for speeding power you want to walk this balance of stiff but fresh and so if you were literally finished a repetition sit on a bench for five minutes you would stand up after that fairly you wouldn't feel so resumably. This is all this is all non-science. This is all practical application right and I could data and I could data there you go. Strength is a little bit different but it's the same concept you're walking that line. In general a lot of the times if you see power lifters and weight lifters in between sets they're going to sit down and not move. For high-purchase you can be a little bit different because you're getting towards fatigue and so the fact as you mentioned like a clearing lactate well first of all lactate is not actually causing fatigue that's a giant myth which is why I teated up. No I'm just kidding. But in the case of again speeding power you're not going to fatigue so if your management is not a really an issue you want to make sure that you're getting complete neurological recovery which is a little bit slower than muscle energetically you're not out of any gas whatsoever right you are not a lack of fuel you know doing three repetitions of a vertical jump. Yep no clog like a gym totally. What about stretching between sets? Yeah you probably don't want to do that either. There are very clear examples of pre-exercise stretching static stretching being quite detrimental for maximum power production. The same thing for speed and strength and that's been shown actually a number of times in a number of laboratories which is like a classic hallmark any sign just looks for if like really jumping on board with an idea. If it's shown not only multiple times but in multiple laboratories from multiple scientists and they're all seeing the same thing you start to get a lot of confidence that that's real finding and that's been shown we've done that in our center for sport performance not myself but one of my colleagues has done a lot of stretching research and he's seen that a lot. I know everything from vertical jump to isoconetic dynamometers and and force velocity curves and there's we've seen this is sprinting we've seen this in speed we've seen this in loaded stuff so you don't want to spend a ton of time stretching statically stretching a muscle prior to if you do that and you have to do that say say for example you finish that you're just like feeling really tight yeah go ahead like you need to get the right position especially for most people where are you willing to sacrifice 10% of power to make sure you don't get hurt yes that answer is almost always yes outside of some very specific athletes scenarios so if you're not in the right position I actually remember having this conversation with Kelly Kelly started a long time ago it was just like yeah fine I'll lose 5% that means I'm not going to get in a bad position and hurt my back and I totally totally agree so if you got to open up a hip or an ankle or something to get there get in the right position number one we'll live with the 5% reduction in power and if you do just reactivate so before you go to your working set go do something fast again a vertical jump a short sprint and acceleration and sort of get that system cleared back up if you didn't stretch it for long enough and you didn't hold it for long enough you should be able to be just fine so when it comes to hypertrophy now you can really stretch what you want because it's not driven by intensity or outcome it's being driven by an insult into the tissue and so if you're pre-feteed for hypertrophy it doesn't matter if you're pre-stretched that doesn't matter we're not going for quality of outcome we're going for quality of internal signal which is not going to be changed by your force output so it doesn't really matter you mentioned a few other things that one might consider in light of the list that you provided of choice order volume frequency and progression right so starting off with power just wanted to hand the the listener show with a whole bunch of different methods to go play with right so as long as you get those concepts the repetition range for power 30 to 70% of your one repetition max depending on the exercise and your training status you're going to get the power as long as you're attempting to go fast is going to be great a lot of things you can try plyometrics are a great example of things that are effective for for power development we've mentioned medicine ball throws short sprints you can even do sprints unlike an air bike which is a great super safe activity you can do them from like a rolling start where you kind of like get going a little bit and then you explode for five seconds to see how fast you can get or a dead start like both of those are very very acceptable weightlifting movements so snatches and clean and jerks are tremendously effective in fact they are a pound for pound by far the most effective exercise choice for power development without question so those are good ones clapping push ups speed squats these are all whole host of different things that you can do for speed and power development depending on your kettlebell swings another great one all these can be done depending on your preference exercise availability what's at your jam or not jam any of those things if somebody is more focused on strength as opposed to power what are the additional variables they should consider again within the context of this overarching theme of choice order volume frequency and progression absolutely it's almost identical with a couple of small exceptions number one you probably can't do as many working sets per week for strength because now you're introducing a heavier load and that's going to represent some sort of fatigue load on the tissue all those things so you could probably get away with doing 20 sets of two of a vertical jump four or five times a week you probably couldn't do that at a 90% on squat right so the total amount of sets in the total amount of weekly load you can get to just needs to be lower and then the intensity right so we talked about that needs to be generally higher than 70% with some portion of that being working sets of some portion of that really truly being at 90% plus everything else is pretty identical you still want to emphasize maximum speed despite the fact you may actually not be moving faster because you've introduced load you still need to be attempting that but you're going to be picking complex exercises you're generally going to be hedging more towards marbells and machines so this is a case where body weight training can be effective again particularly for the upper body but at some point you're really going to have to move past that because there's just a certain amount of load you can't put on the lower body with just your body weight you get limited by how much you weigh or I mean there's a couple of things you can do but you're going to run out past that pretty quickly and so when it comes to strength they tend to be less athletic movements because you know we have to have a barbell onus we have to have a we have to be on a machine or something like that and so that's a subtle difference and exercise choice we need to also be careful about the eccentric portion and things like that we don't have as much risk in and like a speed or power one so some of the different things you can play with there we've talked about doing things like pushes and pulls I also love carries so a farmer's carry pushing a sled dragging a sled all kinds of things a yoke lock all kinds of carry modalities that are very very effective for strength there's eccentric overload training which we really haven't gotten into but it's a really advanced technique where you can actually load at greater than 100% of your one repetition max but you're only going to do the eccentric portion of it so physiologically you are much stronger at eccentric living you are concentrically for a variety of muscle tissue reasons actually and so imagine if you can do a bench press at 200 pounds and what you might actually do is load it to 220 and you would have a spotter and maybe even use it in a rack and you would lower it down under control all the way to the bottom and then stop your friends would lift it back up to top and then you just practice that eccentric portion you would actually be able to lower say 220 pounds effectively despite the fact that you wouldn't have to lift it back up you don't need to start there but that is a very effective method for an actual argument one of my doctoral students right now is doing a project on this at USC and he is focusing directly on this and it's it's quite clear this oftentimes more effective that strength development than anything else because you can actually just like in the speed example where you want to actually practice moving faster so instead of practicing 100% of your one-art max for strength you actually practice that hard not to get better at it so that's another much more advanced tool please don't let me get sued by saying all folks be careful make sure you're doing the proper exercise and you're positioning and in like caveat caveat caveat okay but outside of that it can be is is totally fine and safe yeah with it when people get injured they can't train you don't progress you lose progress so certainly that that's worth highlighting so two more little more vastic links that I don't want throughout there and one of them is called cluster sets so cluster sets are there's a bunch of ways to do it but imagine taking a mini break in between every single repetition so say you're going to do five repetitions in a row but what you're actually going to do is do one repetition set it down pause for five to ten seconds and then do the next one pause do the next one pause pause pause pause pause so you can imagine doing like a squat and you're going to go down explode up you're going to stand there you're going to rack it out you're going to kind of like shake back out catch your breath walk back in do another one rack it out and you're going to repeat that until you've executed your three or four or five repetitions and then you take your three to five minute break before your next set that is an incredibly effective way for both strength power and actually even high perturbate because you can keep the quality the force output the power output very very very high because you're getting these little mini breaks and you're not getting fatigue setting in by the time you hit your say third or fourth or fifth repetition in that set after repetition one you start to see very small subtle reductions power up because you start to see a little bit of fatigue you take those five to ten seconds off even up to twenty seconds you can actually do it you don't see any drop and and force output over the course of the five and so what you really have done is you've got five in this example first repetitions which is the way that we were kind of saying right so all five of those had the same quality as rup number one which is again as we're talking that's the driver and strength and so that's the one we want to preserve so it takes a little bit longer for some exercise it's not very good it's great for like a deadlift because you set it back down shake it back out regroup hard to do with a bench you got to re-rack it back in then re-rack it back out that's it's like kind of a pain in the ass so there's some exercises that doesn't work well with and some that it does but cluster sets and a lot of research on those very effective would you recommend if somebody's doing cluster sets that they do them for every session within that week or just this is an occasional thing you could do it that this could be your training strategy yeah absolutely so you can really take it that serious in fact like if you look at again the weightlifting they will do cluster sets by default not even trying so they'll say they'll do like a and they'll drop the weight back out they're supposed to be doing say a set of three but almost always they're gonna like shake it out re-group and then pull it again and sometimes they're set of three takes like a minute and then it's like he hears funding because it's like like I set a triple PR you're like no you did three singles like what's the difference we're doing three singles and a set of three when you took a minute between each rep I don't know that community so yeah I mean it could be your strategy like it could be like hey for this five week block this is all my training especially for your compound movements if you're going to go to start doing some of the smaller movements maybe you get up on that it could also just be something you do for your one primary exercise for the day so do that thing that is the most important first and just do it for that one and in the rest of them you can kind of ditch it if you need to save a little bit of that time it could also be something you do by feel so you know your your two reps in and you go guy like I'm not feeling like poppy here like re-rack it gets my breath for a quick second and do it so doesn't have to be ultra planned I guess what I'm doing is is I'm giving you an excuse to make sure you're super fresh for every rep it matters the last one I want to talk about here is what's called dynamic variable resistance so dynamic variable resistance is fixing the problem we have what's called the human strength curve so theory of constraints again you're only as strong as you are in your weakest point of the movement so depending on the the movement you do this happens at a different range of motion well the deadlift is easiest example and it's also because we've done like research in my lab using this stuff on the deadlift so I can speak to it very directly when you go to pull it off the ground some people are going to fail right at the bottom meaning they won't get the weight off the ground doll some people will feel just below the knees that's likely to kind of like the hardest transition period and some people will feel right at the top just before they can lock out okay great so what that means is at some point of that lift you're going to only be limited by your strength in the weakest area all right so if you have a constant load on the bar in those other two parts of the range of motion where you are not the weakest they're never truly being tested for their maximum strength because they're always being limited by the previous one and this is the same argument that we would get into if people ask about should what are what you think about using straps right um you know strap your hand to a bar for deadlift things like that there's pros and cons here there are times when you want to use this strap and there are times when it's a bad idea so what dynamic variable resistance is is either using things like a heavy band or a or chains on the bar if you're seeing people do that so in my lab we actually have a force plate on the ground and then we have built in basically hooks on the front of the back so we can actually set a barbell on top of the force plate where you stand on it and then run bands from the back to the front running over top of the weights and so when you stand up as you're going up vertically the bands are getting tighter and tighter and pulling the weight towards the ground so the weight is getting heavier and heavier as you stand up so as you start to gain mechanical advantage in your positioning you start to increase load because the bands are getting tighter and tighter so it allows you to train that full part of the strength curve and to challenge your stronger areas with heavier weight and your weaker areas with lower weight you can do the same thing with a bench press you can do it with the squat and any other exercise variation and dynamic variable resistance is incredibly effective for a number of things you're going to give up a little bit because the total load you can put on the barbell is lower because you're going to be adding you know in large case several hundred pounds of band tension and so it pros and cons it's always a game it changes the curve but it's it's a very good technique that that people it's fairly easy to implement it's fun in fact if you try this on an bench or squat you're going to have a lot of the first time you give it a go you're like oh my god because the bands are pulling you all over the place so you have to get very stable very quick. Bench on a number of times a handful of studies at a many laboratories to be a very effective training technique a little bit more advanced but I wanted to throw that in there for the folks that there maybe just tired of sort of doing the same barbells and dumbbells and machines and you want to try some different a very effective technique. Sounds like fun. Yeah it's great. With your permission I'm going to read back my summary list of training for power and training for strength according to your description and you can tell me where I'm right and where I'm wrong. Yeah I'm going to pick three to five exercises and these should be compound exercises so multi joint movements. I'm going to perform those exercises for three to five repetitions each. I'm going to do three to five movements total per workout and I'm going to rest three to five minutes between sets. Okay if I'm training for power the weight loads on the work sets or not the warm upsets but the work sets are going to fall somewhere in the range of 30 to 70 percent of my one repetition maximum. Yep and the larger the movement the higher that number goes. So on a squat you're okay getting 50 or 60 percent. On a bench you would not want to go that high. You would want to stay close to 30 to 40 percent right. So the way you scale that up and down is dependent upon the difficulty of the movement. Great. If training for strength I'm going to have my work sets be 70 percent or more of my one repetition maximum. Yep and the only thing to add there is in the case of actually all of them. It's okay to go less than three reps per set. So a single or a double one or two reps is also fantastic. So we use three to five as the concept but less is okay going more than that is generally not a good idea. So less is okay more is generally not. Okay and then you listed off a number of really valuable I don't even want to call them fine points but important points to keep in mind within each and both of these programs. One that really stands out in my mind is this idea of if I perform this three by five program but I'm also including some hypertrophy work for arms or calves or muscle groups that might not be hit as directly as one might like during the three by five component. That's okay but do that after the three by five training and keep in mind that that additional work can potentially compromise recovery for the three by five power promoting or strength promoting program. The example being for instance if one does arm work on the first workout of the week or even the you know the third workout of the week or the fifth workout of the week and that arm work is higher repetition, high-perchorep directed work. It's reasonable to assume that it might impede some of the three by five power promoting or strength promoting training in the subsequent workout. So just to be mindful of that and perhaps throttle back on the intensity or the volume or if my goal is strictly power or strictly strength probably best to leave out other forms of training. Yep, love it. One last little thing I don't think we did justice is intention and the reason I want to go back to this now is because we've talked a lot about specific loads you have to hit and that's generally the case but if intention is there you can fudge those numbers in terms of how much load goes on the bar. In fact you can get as low as no load on the bar. A great example here is like a plank exercise. So you could do a plank in what you get in a position and you simply contract the least amount necessary to hold the position. Also you could contract as hard as possible pulling your scapula down and back squeezing your core, squeezing your quad, squeezing your glutes. That is actually going to still help strength production because you're attempting to contract very, very hard. Even no quote unquote the load is the same. That thing extends to weight on the bar. So you could theoretically see large improvements in strength at 50% of your water max if you're contracting as hard as possible. And so there's lots and lots of different ways you can train for strength that are outside of this weight lifting weight training spectrum. And if you people if you hear things like this and you're like, wow, I know I read this book or I saw this other coach who you know, I got so much stronger that way. Well if intention is there, those are absolutely possible. This could be anything from bodyweight style of training. It could be very low load implement stuff. So a kettlebell, a light kettlebell or a ball. It could be single leg training. It's like all kinds of different methods. They will only work for strength though when you're past your first handful of months of training if intention is there. And if it is, then these specific numbers and protocols don't matter as much. So don't get too caught up in them if you're not worrying about exercise quality. And this is very very important because you mentioned earlier about how you stop taking your phone into the gym with you. One of our former students, Ramsey Ninja is the head strength addition coach at the University of Kansas. And he made a great post a couple of days ago where he gave sort of a tip of how to I improve training quality. And one of his tips is set your playlist before you go to the gym. And the reason is people spend so much time in between sets just finding the next song if they like. It makes their work out so long and so unproductive. So that is one strategy or do what you do which is ditch the music entirely. When you don't have music or a phone look at, you only have one job. You only have one thing to pay attention to. And what you'll find is the quality of the training will go up exponentially. You will feel kind of quote unquote bored but that's just means you'll go back to training. And you'll get a lot more done because you have one thing to focus on. So you can get a lot more done when you avoid those distractions. And when you're doing strength and especially power work. Since it's not fatiguing, strength will be a little bit but power won't be. People tend to get very bored. They're used to either feeling a pump or a burn or a sweat or and that's their like perception of my quality of workout. These exercises will not hit that for you. So there has to be another metric you're looking at which is I'm going to try to move as well as like Hannah's heart as I can. That's going to produce your results. If you can't do that, then you might as well just not do these workouts. Go do something else. You're just going to be wasting time. You're going to be burning a very little amount of calories. You'll have wasted an hour and you're going to go right back to the place you were. So be very intentional. There are actually some some studies showing that music can enhance performance. We've done some of these are a lot. So what's that mean? It's not about the music proceeds about the focus in intent. And do whatever it takes to be very focused in intent and you can actually get in and out very quickly and get a lot of work done and see a lot of results. Love it. Okay, let's talk about hypertrophy. The topic that occupies the minds of so many youth young men but also a lot of women. I think one of the really interesting precautions that's taken place in the last decade or so is that far more men and women are using resistance training in order to evoke hypertrophy, growth of muscles for aesthetic reasons and for all sorts of reasons. What are the ways that people can induce hypertrophy? So not to correct you or insult you but probably a better way to think about that question is really what stimuli do I need to give the muscle to induce hypertrophy? Now there are hormonal factors that are important. There are nutritional factors but just to stick with the context of training. This is really going to frame a lot of our answers and as you'll see it's one of the reasons why I call hypertrophy training kind of idiot proof. In terms of program now the work is hard difficult and all that but the precision needed is a lot less than what we saw in power and strength. If you know it's very important that you do it in this style with this intent and with these parameters and if you're outside the parameters it's not going to be. Hyperchrophy has a very broad range in terms of your actual applications and this is why you have and will continue to see countless styles of training that I'll work. I mean I know you were mentored earlier in life by one of my favorite people in this entire field Mike Menser like just an absolute character. His style was completely different than what you would see in a classic textbook or any number of different influencers or coaches or individuals and if you've ever thought yourself like why is it all these programs work and people love to jump to things like well let's just get that out of the equation for now. Independent of that that's not even part of the equation. You're still going to see results and the question is like why? Well that's because what's driving changes in strength and power are the adaptations of specificity. What's driving changes in hypertrophy is much more well-rounded and so you have options to get that. Remember you're training a movement and now you're training a response and a muscle to concentrate. That's very, very different. So if we look at like the classic dogma we have to basically challenge the muscle to need to come back in this case specifically bigger and the nutrients need to be there to support that growth. Okay the nutrients aside perhaps we can come at a few more minutes and talk about that. So all we really have to do is going back to our dogma of activation of something on the cell wall. We've talked about this earlier that's got to induce that signaling cascade. That's got to be strong enough to cause a nucleus to react to it to go to the ribosomes to initiate this entire cascade of protein synthesis. Okay so that signal has to be one of a couple of things. Either it has to be strong enough one time. It has to be frequent enough or it has to be a combination of these things. All right so I can get there with a lot of frequency and a moderate signal. I can get there with very low frequency and a large signal like more I can do what you do with with mic back in the day I'm sure and still train that way. Still train each muscle group mainly once a week directly and once a week indirectly. So all you can all you have to do there to not fail is to make sure the training is hard enough and it's going to work. If you choose the frequency path then you actually have to make sure you're not training too hard to where you can actually maintain the frequency. The only wrong combination here is infrequent and low intensity in low volume. That's it. As long as one of those three variables is high you're going to get there because the mechanisms that are needed to activate that signaling cascade are wide-ranging and this is why when we even see things like blood flow restriction training. This is when you put like a cuff on your arm or you're leg and you block blood flow and you use no load or as low as say 30% of your maximum and you take it to fatigue failure. That actually is an equally effective way of inducing hypertrophy. Despite the fact that you're using 3, 5, 10 maybe most 20 to 30% of your 100 max. Why? Because you went through through the route of metabolic disturbance. Other ways say a higher load maybe as heavy as you can for say eight repetitions is going to get through what's called mechanical tension. There's these different paths that we can get to the same spot. Now eventually these things have a saturation point. You don't need all three of these mechanisms. The third one of course being muscle damage are breakdown. I know we want to chat a little bit about that but none of these three are absolutely required. You can have multiple of them in a session. You don't have to have breakdown at all. That is a complete, well really it's a flat out lie that you have to break a muscle down to cause a fibro. That's this is not needed at all. You have to have one of these three things though. Again this allows you a lot of flexibility which is why crafting your program which is best for you is actually fairly simple when it comes to hypertrophy. You just have to make sure you do the work and you want to make sure you have a few standards in place with the exercise choice and some other things that will wait in just a second. But that's really the fundamental way of getting to it. Making sure either that signal is loud enough or frequent enough to give the nuclei a convincing enough reason to spend the resources because you have to remember two things. In order to grow new skeletal muscle you need amino acids which are your supply and then you need primarily carbohydrates as the energy source to power that synthesis process. You remember basic chemistry. It says if you're going to take two atoms and you're going to pull them apart or put them together. That's going to take energy typically and most of actually metabolism. When you split a bond you're going to get, it's called extragonic. You're going to get energy from that. When you put them together that's going to take energy. This is why we call that protein synthesis. You have to convince your nucleus that one invest those resources in energy, primarily carbohydrate. Number two and more importantly invest that supply. There's a ton of possible ways to get energy but there's a very low amount of amino acids available and you need them for many more things than just taking your biceps from seven hand teenagers to 18 inches. It's not going to do that if you're in a position to where again you can't sustain immune function. If Red blood cell turnover needs to be higher or any of the other main tons of things that you need proteins so you have to be able to say like are you sure? You really want to spend these resources and build it into muscle because once we do that it's very difficult to go backwards. Break them back out and bring amino acids back into that availability pool so we can use them for either another function entirely or even another muscle group. That's called protein redistribution by the way when you say maybe you don't do a lot of upper body work and you're training and you're not eating enough protein or a minimal amount and you're doing a lot of lifting your legs. You'll you'll notice your legs will get larger but that's actually a lot of times you're pulling the protein from so you're upper body in this case and redistributing it back down to the quad. So that's the way you have that's what you have to get to and in terms of application what numbers to hit we can go through each one of our modifiable variables just like we did with speed and strength and power and walk through some of our best practices in each category. Yes so I'd love to talk about those modifiable variables as they relate to choice of movements, order of movements volume so sets and repetitions and frequency of training and I'm particularly interested in frequency of training because that relates to the so-called split where typically one is not training their whole body every workout although there are I'm sure hypertrophy workouts that it our whole body workouts but where people are dividing on their body parts on to different days. Would love to go through this list one by one starting with exercise choice. Cool great so in the previous section we pretty much said exclusively choose your exercises by the movement patterns and you want to balance between pushing and pulling and rotation and things like that and this particular case you have the option to do either. Here's my recommendation. Most people default almost exclusively to choosing by body parts here right I'm going to do cast and shoulders today chest and back whatever combinations of things they want that is clearly effective strategy. However many studies actually have been done where you choose by movement patterns and that is actually equally effective. Now one little caveat actually should have said a few minutes ago when we talk about the research on muscle hypertrophy it is important to distinguish the fact that the vast majority of the research is coming from novice to moderately trained individuals. There's actually more and more research coming out on trained individuals but that's still moderately trained right even those ones. So what happens in those people that are actually way past that point we don't know scientifically it's very difficult to do research there so it's an important caveat on a will acknowledge when I say hey you don't need to do this or you have to do this you were assuming a trained in the status of moderate to low. Mayor may not be true past that we don't know scientifically I have certain thoughts personally but the science will only take us that far so that being said you can actually choose by muscle or by movement pattern here whichever is your personal preference and this is actually where you can act just become a good coach whether you're coaching somebody else through this fitness journey or it's yourself and give them a little bit of autonomy so maybe you select the first three exercises and then let them select one every day and so if they especially want to make sure that one muscle group grows let them target that muscle and maybe the rest of the day you've actually split it up as push pull or something else like that all those strategies are effective personal preference as long as the total amount of volume on the working muscle is equated throughout the week which will get to those numbers in a second then you're going to be the exact same spot no problem I would actually generally encourage people to choose exercises in a variety of actions I actually think that it's important that you do some number of combination of what we call bilateral and unilateral exercises so bilateral being think about it like a squat we're by meaning two lateral you have two feet on the ground moving in sequence here unilateral is one so this could something is simple as a rear foot a little bit of a squat it could be a single leg leg press or single leg curl could be a pistol squat something where the the individual limb is moving one that time you need to have a combination of bilateral and unilateral I'm trying that's good to do for strength as well probably not super important for power but I'm also very important for making sure for i purchase a you're not getting any imbalances as you progress especially through months and years of training so make sure you're doing a little bit of a combination whether you want to pick specific implements that's really a methods question and a preference question and then it is concepts so dumbbell great kettlebell fine barbell awesome band doesn't matter body weight none of these things are as important because all you're trying to do is create a certain insult in the tissue and the implement is just whichever one you feel best doing it and this is where actually machines come into play a lot machines are greatly underappreciated there are a fantastic resource especially somebody who's either early in their fitness journey or somebody who really is having a hard time targeting in muscle group with a bigger compound movement so when you're choosing exercises for a hypertrophy you're going to want to start with those bigger compound movements that's going to be drive a lot of the adaptation you can get to the single joint movements like a little bit later but having said that because of the way that people move differently their bomb or their anthropometrics and their bomb mechanics and even their technique the same exact exercise will not necessarily work the same exact muscle groups for multiple people so if you and I both went and did a back squat if you did it a little bit more of what we call a high bar squat so this is the bar is literally setting up higher up on your neck you're keeping your back more vertical and in order to do that you shift your knees much further past your toes keeping of course your whole foot on the ground in good position okay that's going to generally put more of an emphasis on the knee joint right and so that's not a bad thing you tend to see a little bit more work in the quads there a little bit less work in the spinal records and back because you're actually not supporting the weight horizontally which is a difficult position it's vertically stacked okay if I were doing the classic rule bar squat which is again lowering the bar down my for the down my back towards one more like my shoulder blades I probably take a little bit of a lighter stance and when I squat I drive my glutes back further away from midline in as in fact as a general rule if you take the midline of your body the thing that move is a farthest away from that midline is likely to be the thing that's activating the most so in the case of the of the front squat you're not generally going to be using your glutes as much if you're in the not even front squat just that high bar squat where you're very very vertical your knees are going to be moving very far over your toes it's just fantastic therefore it's a little bit more knee dominant as can we say it the other version here you can keep your shins really close to vertical you move your butt backwards you're going to have to then lean forward with your torso which means it'll be more low back more glutes and a little bit less knee now that's a general statement it's not necessarily always true but as a guideline there that is one exact exercise where you may be going man I'm trying to improve this clear weakness I have in my quads I can't even leg extension my bodyweight I have a significant problem there so maybe in your particular case if I'm hammering you or you're hammering yourself in a squat exercise and you're wondering why your quads aren't getting any stronger or are growing any size it may be because of the style of the movement so I may need to go Andrew all right look squats in general if you look at the research aren't excellent exercise for quad development but for you they're not because of the way you stand or just because of you know neural activation it doesn't matter so I need to take you to a machine and isolate that muscle group so we can make sure we see development in that so if you're trying to grow a specific body part area individual muscle it's very important that you're actually seeing progress there and don't worry about well in the textbook the bench press is supposed to be good for your pack because if you're not actually moving the right position or depends on the angle in which your sternum actually sits in your body a bench press may actually be doing very little for your pack and you may need to adjust to say an incline bench or a decline bench or a peck fly so machines can be fantastic at letting you isolate without having to worry about things like stability your low back position getting hurt or your neck at you can really concentrate on just the movement concentrate on the muscle and let everything else kind of go away and ensure you're getting training in that specific area those are excellent recommendations one thing I wanted to ask about is prioritizing specific body parts and therefore specific exercises and here I'm not necessarily referring to trying to bring up a so-called weak body part you know at area that tends to be either genetically deficient because in some cases I learned for instance I've seen a lot of competitive track and field championships I love watching track and field is a spectator of the Hayward Field in Oregon whenever there's a meat and I'm sure really love that the sprinters are amazing they have some of the highest calves in the world that I've ever seen I mean like little like little micro calves but they're fast as hell yeah there's right behind the knee and they have a very long distance between that calf and their foot which makes it propulsion excellent right they wouldn't stand a chance as a competitive body builder but because something different is being selected for in body building but obviously they're they're magnificent for sprinter most people of course reside somewhere between the extreme of you know very long muscle bellies from you know origin to insertion or very very short muscles usually people have one or two body parts that they want to emphasize for whatever reason you know these days it seems to be um people are really whether they say now like glutes or the new bicep or bicep or the new glutes or add on out anyway you see this stuff I love them by the way I am so pro curls in the squat rack there you go there you go so no nobody killed me so everyone has their thing but the that they would like to emphasize but I have a question because we're specifically talking about hypertrophy which is should people give themselves permission to not train a body part if their goal is balanced hypertrophy I'll give a couple of examples one of the reasons why I for instance not done a lot of freeweight squatting is because despite my quadriceps being rather weak according to you they tend to grow rather easily relative to other muscle groups and the goal for me has always been balance development and so I emphasize hamstring work and I emphasize a you know calf work and hamstring work it's not that I don't train my quadz at all but I do far less for them and I avoid the big compound movements for them occasionally do them and again this is not about what I do or don't do but I think that in the context of a conversation about hypertrophy is it appropriate to give people permission to say listen if you're just genetically strong large lats doing a lot of chin ups and rows might actually be the worst thing for you if your goal is balanced development and I ask because I don't often hear anyone any you know credentialed people give people permission to completely avoid training a given body part if their goal is balanced development and yet I think most people whose resistance training are seeking balanced development I don't know anybody that actively wants to have big upper body small legs I think that comes from neglect and laziness in most cases sometimes injury related or other things but I think this is an important point to raise that any good program for hypertrophy I would think would have to take into account people's genetic and natural variation sport based variation in which muscle groups just tend to grow easily for them in which ones require a lot more focus and work yeah absolutely you first of all you have permission to do or not do anything you like to do in terms of of hypertrophy training I generally would not recommend disregarding a muscle group entirely I know that's not what you actually suggested but just to make sure that people didn't hear it that way what I would do is in this example is I would continue to do those big movements I would just keep the volume low so I might do two sets or something twice a week there's a whole bunch of reasons you want to make sure that those motor patterns are there you want to make sure that the especially the benefit of these compound movements is you get to work so many complementary muscle movements at the same time so in the case of like loaded squat you're not only working stability in the hip as well as the knee but you're also working upper body your your rhomboys are keeping in position your neck has to stay in position your toes everything is working and so it's really difficult to get those things when you take that movement out and you replace it with say a machine hamstring curl that whole element of balance and your logical control is very very important to maintain over time and that just gets removed with if you go to machines only so I would keep some of those things in maybe even not all year round maybe one quarter of the year two quarters every other rotate it something like that as long as it is good you're not if the reason you weren't doing the say those squats was because you're like oh it hurts my back okay great then leave it out but if it's simply you don't want your quad so much I would just keep that volume low and do something just to kind of touch it keep it activated and to maintain all those other things like flexibility range of motion I would better anything your addoctors are probably underdeveloped right now you can get those by doing your squats because you're not really doing I'm sure in much adduction training and so this the things like that that just get lost when you're only thinking all big muscle groups that that come inherent in doing the larger movements and so you don't have to worry about them or train them separately I appreciate that and in reality I do two to three really hard worksets of hack hack machine squats per week yeah which is plenty for me to maintain and even get a little bit stronger but per our earlier discussion about a year ago I shifted to doing very low repetition ranges to mean strength in that movement but I am actively avoiding hypertrophy in that muscle group yeah or another solution would actually be do something like one set to fill your week not even extremely long just you know do something in the eight to fifteen repetition range at the end of all that strength set and just give a little bit of pump there and then and then just just so just so that those muscles can touch that level of fatigue touch that level of strain and mechanical tension walk away great thank you for that what about exercise order amazing so implicit in this exercise choice thing it's what you're going to notice is these modifyable variables interact with each other right and you can clearly see how when we talked about volume and to clarify volume is the repetitions multiplied by the sets that's typically how we express volume well that's going to be directly influenced by intensity the heavier load you put on the barbell the last repetitions you can do and the inverse right rest intervals the shorter you keep your rest intervals then either the lower the weight has to go the intensity or the lower the rep range has to go order is the same thing choice is the same thing so all of these things modify each other they play a little bit of a hand and and whatever thing else does so with the exercise choice thing rolling into exercise order you get to play a couple of games here when we talked about strength and power I basically said stick to the big movements most complicated and compound movements you don't have to do that with hypertrophy you can do this in a couple of ways you can do the thing you're just simply most interested in first you can do this thing called pre-fateek so say you're going to do a back day you could go in and do nothing but isolated biceps as you're very first exercise and then roll into your your pulling movements because what you'll see is during most pulling activities the biceps are a secondary or tertiary muscle group but you've pre-fateek them you've guaranteed that muscle of most interest that it's it's most training in and everything else is secondary so you can start if you want with single-joining movements you can start with isolation stuff or you can start with compounds so either way it just really comes down to preference and what you're specifically trying to develop now this also goes back to the exercise choice question right because it's it's sort of the same thing right like which one am I choosing and where I wanted at the campus was the exercise splits and so we you sort of talked about am I doing bipartisan splits and I know a question I get a lot here is which ones should I pack and just together I'm not really concerned with it what you all you should worry about is how many times per week and in fact total volume you achieve on a muscle group per week and I don't doesn't really matter how those things are folded and it's really a personal preference issue one mistake that we see here commonly is grossly under appreciating that the legs are not a muscle group right so the legs have a whole bunch of muscle groups in them so we see a class exploit like I'll do shoulders and chest Monday and then I'll do you know biceps and four arms Tuesday and then legs Wednesday or whatever and then back to upper butt and it was like you're like wait a minute you have four days dedicated to the upper body and one for a quote unquote legs well like you hopefully you can see the imbalance what's that's going to happen over time is you're going to do do you do far more upper body than you are lower body and that's not appropriate so you just want to think about your lower body like you would do if you're going to do body parts splits then include those things as well and I'll just chunk everything in as legs once a week if you want to do that that's actually okay but that day has to be very very challenging and you probably should do a quite a bit of volume um they're because you're almost surely not going to hit the total weekly volume needed to optimize muscle growth if you're literally only doing once a week of your quote unquote legs so along those lines let's talk volume yep how much volume does each muscle group need per week in order to generate and for that matter maintain hypertrophy right so the kind of a minimum number we're going to look for here is 10 working sets per week correct per muscle group correct and just to make sure that everyone's on the same page if I do a chin up or pull up I'm going to mainly be training my back muscles my lats if I'm doing it correctly lats and rhombodes and biceps right and if so but there'll be indirect targeting of the biceps so would you include indirect targeting so for instance if I you said 10 sets per week let's just use biceps because it seems that that's the go to generic muscle for what why is that by the way that when people ask somebody to you know flex their muscle they always flex their bicep they don't flex their calf or quad or their glutes or something I guess there's some you know public decency issues or I can tell you with my children that's the very first muscle I thought they're flexed their glutes no they're they're biceps I got what you say are and in good good healthy parenting advice from the doctor and a yelping so if it's 10 sets per week for biceps in order to maintain or further grow the biceps but does that mean if somebody does 10 sets of chin ups or 10 sets of chin ups and rows that they are checking off any of the boxes for biceps assuming that they're doing the movement properly and targeting the major muscle group that a given movement is supposed to target which in my mind when you're doing chin up you're supposed to mainly be using your back muscles and then there are secondary muscles or secondary activation of other muscles but of course some people their arms grow like crazy when they do chin ups and their back doesn't grow at all so this is where we're back to the kind of genetic preloading of the system yep if you will so how does one meet this 10 sets per week minimum when dividing different body parts and thinking about this directing indirect ideation so two thing there's no specific exact rule here and this is why these set ranges are ranges right and this is why we don't say like 10 is so 10 would be sort of the minimum number you want to get to the more realistic number that most people especially if you're advanced or even intermediate is more like 15 to 20 working sense per week okay now if you're very well trained you probably want to even push more towards like 25 and in fact past that there's this not a lot of research so the optimal number maybe 30 we don't really know it's just hard to get that much work and it may actually be detrimental and here we're referring to natural athletes that is people who for whatever reason either because they're not taking any prescription drugs or maybe if they are whose levels of steroid hormones mainly the endrogens like test and instrument etc do not exceed the normal reference range values either because that's what they are naturally or that's what they're replacing through pharmacology yep whereas when we think of technically someone could be taking exogenous hormones to replace a deficiency and then there's there's still a normal range okay but I just want to clarify because you work with athletes and number of different sports where drugs are and are not tolerated etc and the general population that what we are talking about here is for the general population and not for steroid using athletes correct okay yeah so so 10 was this sort of that like absolute minimum number to maintain which is actually pretty cool if you think about it this way if you and N and you did three sets of 10 the very same sets of 10 repetitions correct you already got three you did that three days a week you're at your nine that's almost 10 if you also just went to gym one day a week you did three sets of 10 and you did three exercises you're at nine it's at working sets you're basically done so achieving 10 sets per week per muscle group and now we're not even talking about indirect activation of a secondary so you're going to hit 10 fairly easy um extension of that hitting 20 is actually still not that hard because of what's actually going to happen there so in your example if you're doing your chin ups well with the biceps count there's no exact rule there because there could be technique issues it could be hand position so you mentioned chin up very specifically a chin up is actually going to put your hands in in this position where your palms are facing up right this is supination of pronation so you're going to be there well that's actually quite different than a pull up or your hands are in the opposite direction so um up a chin up actually is going to be pretty good activator in your biceps for most people um so you would expect to actually to probably count that because it's going to be very difficult to not see some fatigue in your biceps depending on your mechanics depending on and by that I mean just the the segment lengths of your bones like that's where your muscles are originate insert there's nothing you could do about not even a technique or a focus issue it's just simple fact the matter that's how you pull best in that area um the position of which your hands are on the barber a wider grip more narrow grip it's going to change muscle use so we talked about earlier I think in the previous episode exercises do not determine how to adaptions applications you but exercises do determine things like the movement plane the joint you use and typically the eccentric concentric sort of ratio as well as oftentimes the muscle groups involved so there's just not a lot of things you can do depending on how you are built of you know some exercises activating a secondary group and you don't want it so is not always a technique as you may just be that's how you're built right and the same could be true for a squat um the high bar versus low barx sort of example we talked about earlier it's you know you you could see plenty of evidence on muscle activation studies where people even doing the vertical back squat style have tremendous glue activation and folks doing the the low bar have tremendous quad activation so a lot of it depends on personal mechanics so what I counted is the question really you just have to ask yourself number one do you really care that much you know you have a range to get to if you're anywhere between 10 to 25 working sets you know you're fine so if you count or don't count it's just going to change the difference between whether you did 17 working sets or 23 any of the way you're fine so I don't really care number two are you actually feeling anything there so if you're doing your chin ups and your biceps are blowing up I'm counting that right if you're doing it you're like no I don't feel any fatigue there it's all my then I'd probably say okay when I'm going to count that as towards it so you can just let that guide you a little bit towards your count yeah I've always noticed that there are certain muscle groups that are very easy to isolate yeah when under load and those are almost always the same muscle groups that are easy to contract very hard without any load whatsoever bingo you know that's actually really insightful so you can kind of use this youristic of like if you can contract your lats just standing here you're probably going to contract them very well when you lift if you can't you can probably soon about the same things going to happen so yeah you'll know this is actually the lats are actually really interesting because they tend to be one of the more difficult muscle groups to learn how to activate so if you're in your journey you're just like I have no idea and you can look up like a lat pose so how do you like how do you puff your lats out how do you show it and if you do that and you're like wow there's no movement here just recognize that's extremely common and that it's probably going to take you many many many months of trying before you start to see some movements and probably even a few years before you really start to see activation so you're not some sort of like specific like special geninic anomaly it's very very common it's uncommon to not be able to activate your biceps right that everyone can do that but if you just like man I can't get this here I'm just going to stop doing it do not do that just keep at it and just keep concentrating and thinking about that muscle group it will take some time it's very common to have challenges activating lats yeah I've noticed that many of the muscle groups that were responsible for a large fraction of the work in the various sports that I played as a young child or muscles that are very easy for me to selectively isolate and induce high pressure for you and I suppose I'm one of those mutants where my lats happen to be one such of those muscle groups I think that's because I swam a lot when I was good literally going to ask me a summer yeah I said tell tell tell yeah everyone every kid in my town swam and played soccer and then later I you know I escape where it did some you generally hear that I'm sure that's you either were a swimmer or you were a wrestler so it's like that polling and pull tour to use is thousands of repetitions allowed you to get very good at contracting but because um I also played soccer and skateboarding but I didn't do any baseball basketball football muscle groups like deltoids are very challenging to activate and isolate so I do think that early development is superimposed on a genetic template that sort of predicts which muscle groups are going to be easier or harder to isolate and training it's also a very good case for why it's important to do as many different athletic activities as you can in your youth yeah and if you do skateboard definitely learn to ride switch because every every skateboarder I know has one leg that's larger than the other one calf that's larger than the other and actually for that matter people do martial arts that don't learn to um if they're not south-poff they don't learn to switch up and do their works out pod you see the same thing I mean you're building an asymmetry into the system and it's not just muscular it's neural oh strong or neural yeah so yeah kids um parents get your kids doing a bunch of different things I suppose gymnastics would probably be the best sport all around in terms of um movement in multiple planes and activating all the different muscle groups uh yes and no um there's a lot of benefit no question about it there's a lot of other things though that it that has limited ability so um almost everything in not like gymnastics right but almost everything in that is pre-planned which is a major downfall right so the joy of skating is there's so much proprioceptive input that you have to make decisions very quickly um in in small windows now you have a little bit of that when you're flipping in the air you have to land but you gymnastics gymnasts tend to have a very specific routine that they're working on and they work on that routine for years and go out of so I'm just going for me it was transportation it was freedom and it didn't require any coaches or parental oversight yeah yeah ball sports have the beauty of of reaction and things like that so all of that were wonderful um yeah good to do a lot of them you've established that 10 really to 20 sets per week yeah is the kind of bounds for um maintaining and initiating high-purchasing free yep if I were to like flag one of them I would say 15 to 20 is the set that you want to get um working now it gets complicated when you ask how many reps per set do I have to get to okay well we also can complicate that by repetition type and tempo just sort of let all that go for now and just think if you're getting close to that range you're in the spot and all you have to do now is balance two things recovery and continue training okay so if you're somewhere in this 10 to 20 working sets range and you're in a position where you can continue to do that you're not so sore and so damaged and beat up that you can't maintain that volume for you know eight weeks at a time or at least six weeks at a time then I'll probably say either the style of repetitions the amount of repetitions per set you're doing are too much the volume is getting to you however if you're not seeing adaptations then I'd say maybe the repetition don't enough and so that's like that's the kind of game you're running now there could be plenty of other factors intensity of course yeah intensity intent and then of course the other things sleep nutrition etc all these other things that that go into our visible stressor category that we always analyze this is sort of brings up this idea of responders and non-responders so we get this one a ton so why is it some people my my Jim buddy my roommate we go to sleep the same time we're on the same nutrition plan we work out together sheet triples in muscle size and I don't have like no gain whatsoever well there's a lot of work that we're trying to do to identify the molecular mechanisms behind responders and non-responders because they clearly exist in fact this is one of the reasons why every paper I basically will ever publish again if I you know if I do always reports individual person data so rather than group averages you get to see you know if there's 10 subjects and you get to see how each of the 10 responded because the group average can get confusing what you really want to see is how many actually people got better how many got worse how many maybe change and so so we'll always report those individual data because when you go to train you're you you're not the group average that's very important to know so if you do that you can see a beautiful line of these hyper responders the bell curve in the middle of the normal spawners and those folks who like through any training study just won't get any better if you can tease out what you can't but let's say in science you could tease out all the extra factors total stress load hydration sleep etc what you often see is non-responders a lot of the time it's not that they have a physiological inability it's just like they did they need a different protocol and a lot of times it's they just need more volume so if they can handle that and they're not accessible we beat up just give them more volume and they tend to see a lot of breakthroughs you see the same thing with platos so typically it's sort of just like okay the routine you're on you've been on it for too long we need to either go to the other end of the hypertrophy spectrum for intensity which means like if you've been in the like 60 to 70 percent everyone repetition max range maybe we actually need to go heavier at take our repetitions down maybe even our total volume down and go heavier try that a great way to break through platos of grand if all the other boxes are checked the other one is is due the which is like okay we're going to go higher we're going to go sets of 20 set to 25 high very high repetition range and really get after it not to do as much damage because you don't tend to get as sore from those really high repetition ranges you'll get more sore from lower repetition higher intensity range then you will typically be the other ones and and see if we can plus bust through some platos there so it's just generally means you need to do something a little bit different than your your training partner so we've talked about exercise choice and we've talked about the number of sets that one needs in order to induce hypertrophy per week what about repetition ranges you've mentioned pretty broad repetition ranges how many repetitions per set is required in order to induce hypertrophy yep so there are two caveats here before I give you the number is some more between like four to 30 reps 30 repetitions absolutely in fact I think you can go much higher the first 20 have to be feel exceedingly light correct and during those first 20 or so repetitions is the goal still to contract the muscle as hard as possible on each repetition so this is the caveats here so caveat number one is there is an assumption that by the end of the set you're getting somewhat close to failure and so you don't have to go to absolute failure to to induce muscle hypertrophy but you you also have to get kind of close so if you're going to do a set of 25 and you finish it and you're like oh yeah like that was kind of starting to get hard at the end that's not going to be enough if you're going to do a set of five or six and the same sort of expression comes out of your amount that's not going to be so in that case it doesn't matter or you're up range if you're not getting somewhat close to failure again it doesn't need to be complete failure a good number to think about is like minus two which is what we call reps and reserve which is sort of like I got within two or so reps of failure and then I stop and can we define failure at least for sake of this portion of the conversation as the point at which you can no longer move the resistance could be your body could be a weight machine etc that you can no longer move the resistance any more in the concentric phase of the exercise movement in good form correct that's a really nice momentary muscular failure is a slightly typically defining it there's a wonderful review I think it's open access that just came out in the last handful of months Eric Helms' team at a New Zealand the Eric is a great scientist and a very experienced physique coach and a better to himself so he knows a lot about this area and that paper went through all the exact definitions in detail all the caveats that we're not going to have time to get into today so I would recommend folks like check that out they want more information but I'll try to get the highlights of it right here so what they basically showed is going all the way to failure in the defining failure like you just did right so momentary muscular failure you can't complete another repetition through complete range of motion through whatever range of motion you determine prior to as well as with good technique so other body parts aren't being compromised serve etc and doesn't need to be total failure that minus two failure is still needed in caveat two which is again very very highly trained individuals you won't see people who are like Eric or folks who are six to eight to ten years into very serious training who don't have to go to failure probably a little bit more than what I just said so the the the layout that they brought in our paper was very nice and they basically said okay here's a couple of scenarios in which going to failure is maybe the best way to do it number one you probably should do it on a little bit of the safer exercises so maybe taking your back squat on a barbell to complete failure and doing that is like a standard protocol multiple times week it's maybe not the best choice so maybe if you're going to do barbell back squats you take that to your you know your one or two reps and reserve stop there it's a lot of work it actually going back to our discussion with the prolific chart it's a similar idea right we're going to spend most of your time in these working sets 70 to 90 sort of percent and then you're going to take that failure to maybe the hacksquaw machine or maybe even to Lake extension machine so a little bit of a safer exercise they also can tend to be single joint exercises don't have to be but they're just ones that are not as complicated and you're not likely to injure other body parts when you're doing it all right so that's one one way to go about it another way to go about it is simply doing it on like the last movement of the day right and so again you're not going to do it on your first three or four exercises but whatever your last finisher is you'll hit total failure on that one and that kind of keeps you in a range of yeah you hit some failure you got a lot of overall work done so that's a lot of stimulus that's a lot of noise going to that nucleus that says grow grow grow grow grow but you didn't totally obliterate yourself especially if you don't have the assistance of metabolic service right that's very very important if you have those you can push this a lot harder because your recovery would be significant hands if not you kind of want to walk away from that I have to assume that you know 99% of people listening this do not and and yet among those who are not taking anything in terms of antibiotics they're I think is a large range of recovery quotients out there some people just tend to recover better some people I think also are far more diligent about what I would call the necessary but not sufficient variables of adequate sleep proper nutrition limiting stress and so on yeah I can't wait to break all this up down I got a whole very long discussion for all those things we will get into it in all its practical realities and actionables before long what about rest between sets great this is the interplay now so what one actually thing we said for a long time is you want to stick between 30 to 90 seconds of rest between sets fryperchery and that's because we're trying to activate this metabolic disturbance or disruption you need a little bit of a burn a little bit of a pump to go there more recent research a lot of these out of Brad show on feels lab and others have shown that that's just doesn't seem to be the case again for moderate to to newly trained individuals whether that's the case for the highly trained folks I don't necessarily know I don't think there's any difference here so you can take up to three to five minutes rest in between sets and be fine the caveat here those this if you're gonna rest longer that means the metabolic challenge is lower so you need to then increase the challenge in either mechanical tension which think about as weight load or muscle breakdown so you can't lower one of the variables keep everything else the same and expect the same result so if you're going to have more rest then you need to either preserve the load on your bar or the volume one of the two has to happen so this gives people a lot of opportunity I generally tell people if you're going to train fryperchery it's probably best to stay in the two minute range at most you can go longer but a lot of people have a hard time actually coming back and then executing that next set with enough intent to get there and or it's going to make your workouts tremendously long so you can stick to the shorter one you don't have as much mechanical tension but that's okay you can get there but reality it is you can do whatever you would like tell me if this is a reasonable structure given what you've told us three exercises per muscle group first exercise slightly heavier loads so repetition ranges somewhere between let's say five and eight with perhaps hitting failure or close to it on the last set rest periods of somewhere between two or let's let's get wild and say five minutes okay so it's a little bit more of a strength type work out at that point but then moving to a second exercise of three or four sets where the repetition ranges now eight to 15 shortening the rest periods to 90 seconds or so and then on the third exercise repetition ranges of 12 to 30 this number 30 kind of makes me wide I don't know that camera over the last time I did a set of 30 thinking it was for hypertrophy but what you're saying makes absolute sense is research back so very short rest intervals maybe 30 seconds between between sets would that allow somebody to target all three forms of major adaptation I mean in my mind it works you know you're talking about mechanical loads you're talking about stress and damage and you're talking about metabolic stress is that better than to for instance do all the high repetition work in one work out per week and then higher loads and the other work out it doesn't matter if you divide them up or combine them it would not matter I would say it matters in the sense of your personal practical situation well long rest for me I love training heavier with longer rest rate but I'm hearing that there's real value to doing these higher repetition ranges yeah so the formula you set up there in a second is great if you want to do it the other way that's fine you really it's kind of idiot proof you can set this up however you'd like you could actually do the inverse theoretically you could do the sets of 31st and then moved your sets of eight it doesn't really matter because we're trying to just get to a certain total stimuli and you're going to hit it eventually so you have a lot of room to play here you also have a lot of room to adapt based on your circumstances God I'm short on time today typically my workout takes me 60 minutes for this plan I have I've only got 35 today what do I do well if you're training for strength that's a different answer than if you're training for hypertrophy if you're training for hypertrophy you need to make sure you hit that total volume so in this particular case lower the load lower the rest intervals and just get to the burn and get going as much as you can if you're training for strength I would rather you cut your volume in half get those few repetitions down at that high load and just don't do very many sets today that's a better result so the goal that you're going after is going to determine what we call chaos management which is that thing like that um running out of time today my time is short or you didn't even think my time was short something I cut off I'm not feeling it today I'm in a hotel etc etc etc which is life right that's going to be 10 to 50% of your workouts is going to be chaos management well how you make those decisions is going to go back to understanding number one what goal you're going after in the number two what are the physiological consequences call these physiological limiters for each one and that's going to tell you what to select and prioritize the volume the intensity or whatever else I'd like to ask about frequency but I'd like to frame it a little bit differently then that I'd like to ask about total workout duration which dovetails with frequency because if one is hitting the appropriate number of sets per week and one is combining different muscle groups on the same days well then workouts are going to be a very different duration yeah so yeah so then if one is doing a different body part each day for instance and so I feel like any discussion about frequency has to be within the context of workout duration and vice versa yeah if you are a lifting junkie and you're very consistent your schedule I'm actually okay with body parts but most people are not that and so the concern there is if you say are isolating and waiting to do your clutes on one day the week and something happens on that day you might go another 13 days now before training it between workouts and that's really difficult to maintain the frequency won't be high enough unless the load and volume on that one day is astronomically high this is not going to happen so while if you look at the research frequency in terms of how many days per week doesn't matter that much as long as the total load and failure are equivalent practically it's a challenge so it's hard because life gets in the way for most people especially if you have kids in a job and all these things are there so I actually prefer doing something more like three days a week of total body and if something happens you've just missed that body part for 48 hours 72 hours I like that a little bit for most people not because it's more effective but just because it's a little bit more resilient to life and you can get there if you wanted to actually do a little bit of a combination so if you want to do like two days a week of whole body and then two days a week of a little bit of a body part split then you're actually sort of hedging against all risks there as long as you get to that total number there now there is actually some evidence in a couple of ways that maybe a little bit more frequently is a little bit better but the difficulty is now going back to the practicality question of like how many people really can train just their strength training six days a week that doesn't count any of their long duration stuff it isn't how they're high heart rate their flexibility they're okay it's just really really really hard to get all that stuff in so it is it tends to be easier on folks in terms of execution and long term adherence in my opinion to get that volume accomplished in a little bit more frequent patterns but not once a week so I like to kind of have it right there for most people not again not because it is technically going to go more effective but because you're less likely to fail to progress because of skipping a workout something popping up your power going out and your you know garage door being locked on your whatever imagine that that happened to me this morning folks couldn't get out of my driveway because the gate the electronic gate was down because the power was down anyway solve that problem yeah the way you describe it my senses that workouts will last somewhere between one and two hours of real work is that about right it doesn't have to be near you that long I mean you could certainly get enough to work done in 30 minutes if you've been in a whole body workout yeah yeah absolutely so if you're doing that three days a week so remember the numbers are trying to hit here let's say we're trying to hit 15 working sets for muscle group per week that's five working sets per day for muscle group so if you did one neccessions for that they let's say it is quats you did five sets you did a three days week you're done there's your 15 but there are other muscle groups to hit on that same day you're doing squats you're doing whole whole body yeah so you've gotten them already and so like all leg muscles in that example are are taken care of so you would not do separate hamstring work you wouldn't need to now hamstrings is actually a little bit of a caveat like that's a good example of an exercise or a muscle group that's probably really good to make sure you isolate it's challenging to get with your standard dead lift and and squat it's one of the probably ones that's most important to go target outside of that but in theory theoretically though outside of that you would get most of your leg muscles done with even a single exercise and even if you wanted to change it up so you said all right Monday I'm going to do a squat variation uh Wednesday the next day I'm going to do some sort of deadlift hinging variation and then maybe Friday my third day I'm going to do some sort of unilateral maybe rear foot elevate a Swiss squat or something like that all right maybe even a lateral lunge maybe a different plane okay you're in a pretty good spot you're going to hit most of those muscles to your 15 working sets especially if you take sort of that last set each day it's a pretty close to failure that's going to get some more serious work done but you're not going to be so fatigued you can't come back and train it a couple of days later and you'll be fine so you could even split that up in a two days a week and now all you really have to do is hit something like seven working sets so maybe that's two exercises per day maybe some sort of a leg press and a leg hinge you know a three to four sets each you're going to six to eight sets that day you do that three days a week now so you're at that 20 24 sets about having a bit of a same thing on your body I just gave lower body examples because you know I like the lower body more so it's not that challenging to get to those numbers and split and those workouts can be extremely short so if you're if you were doing that three days a week you know you're you're getting you're doing that one exercise everybody one exercise lower body that certainly shouldn't take more than 40 minutes I'm happy to hear that not because I don't like training yeah please please excuse the double negative but I found that resistance training workouts that extend longer than one hour of work and certainly longer than 75 minutes of work leave me very fatigued oh sure and fatigued to the point where concentrating on cognitive work throughout the day can be challenging need a longer nap in the afternoon I'm a big proponent of naps in the afternoon in any case but requiring longer naps in the afternoon etc so at least for me restricting the resistance training workouts to about 50 50 to 60 minutes of real work yeah for me three or four times per week has helped tremendously so it's a case where doing higher intensity work in a shorter period of time and actually hitting muscle groups less frequently for me that's again one directly ones indirectly yep has worked really well and as you mentioned earlier this could very well be explained by not my recovery quotient as some sort of genetic or physiological variable but the way that I'm training and indeed I like to do a few four straps and go to failure on certain sets and you know we need in that in that genre of training it's also fun like to just train hard it is it is I think that um I've learned a lot by training to quote unquote to failure core I think there's a lot of learning in there um provided it's done safely but what you're describing actually inspires me to at least give a try to these other sorts of splits and ways of training for hypertrophy and strength because this notion of not necessarily having to go to failure and still being able to evoke strength and hypertrophy um adaptations is a really intriguing one uh dare I even say a seductive one and that leads me to a question that is based on findings that I've heard discussed on social media which means very little of anything unless it's in the context of people who really um no exercise science and uh you're one such person and that's this idea that because resistance training can evoke approaching synthesis adaptation response but that adaptation response is last about 48 hours before it starts to taper off that the ideal in quote frequency for training and given muscle group for hypertrophy is about every 48 hours is that true yes and no so a couple of things there remember in order to grow a muscle there's multiple steps here so you have the signaling response which actually happens within seconds of exercise and can last depending on the marker you know up to an hour or two hours step number two then is gene expression and we'll we see that that's typically peaked around two to six hours post-sexual size and then you have following that protein synthesis and that's that long gr time frame some are between 12 hours there it's certainly not peaked for 48 hours it may be still there 48 hours from now but it is is absolutely coming down at that point depending on sort of a number factors so that that part of is sort of true so that this is a combination of like some half-true and some like maybe just pedantic things that aren't really that important to differentiate the real question I think is is like okay is it okay to train sooner slash is it better to train sooner or actually is it better to wait longer there's no real reason to think that you need to train if the goal is hypertrophy any sooner than 48 hours afterwards I can't think of an advantage that that would confer I also can't think of any practical applications athletes physique bodybuilders coaches that ever found tremendous success doing that so I would be very skeptical that that is at any way better now could you do it in some instances of say you know you've got travel coming up like that so that you just want to preload the system by destroying the whole no problem and then waiting seven days or 14 days I've known people have done that before I do the occasions or layoffs every time like every single one I like themselves and then take it totally lay off yeah and it's like there's no benefit there other than psychological like I just love it that it feels great to be super sore I feel less crappy not training for those couple days because I'm a super sore anyway you need the extended rest yeah of course and it's just like it's just a crappy justification in my brain that like it's used to do something really wild and that I totally don't need and get waste or that I should get doctor and he galvan suggestions of what not to do but that he does yeah a hundred percent right so as I say not as I do the famous words of every research prevent yeah I think 48 hours is a reasonable time to wait can't think of any advantage going sooner than that there's really not a tremendous amount of advantage of waiting much longer than that certainly 72 hours is fine as long as you're hitting these concepts we've talked about you can let really life determine that I mean there's situations too with like particularly our athletes where we have to kind of break that because of schedule obligations so they're playing every fifth day every third day or something like that you're just going to have to lift them back to back days and you just now have to get it done but yeah I can't think of why I would go out of my way to do that the second part of that question is let's say somebody trains a muscle they train it properly they hit it in their appropriate rep ranges and appropriate rest etc that the stimulus is there the adaptation is set in motion they're getting somewhere somewhere at 48 hours or so a protein synthesis peak that's going to taper off but they don't train it 48 hours later or 72 hours later they train it five or six days later not because they're lazy not because they they don't care but because they have other priorities that are woven in with high-coding hypertrophy in this muscle right there are people who exist only to get hypertrophy and to give it muscle group but let's be fair most people would like to grow that muscle group but then does it necessarily mean that the muscle starts to revert to its pre-hypertrophic state that is does it atrophy and get smaller again because if it does and I could see a lot of reasons for hitting a muscle group once every five days or seven days provided you hold on to the hypertrophy that you initiated five or seven days ago yeah there's no reason to think you will lose anything in that sort of a time domain five to seven days the only challenge with training that infrequently is can you actually get enough total volume done so if you're going to train them also once a week you either have to go to real failure real damage and soreness or you have to figure out a way to hit 20 cents that day in that muscle not at all impossible especially if you think well actually I have to get this 15 and I'm going to do five sets of three exercises that's not outrageous not at all so it's so like absolutely possible if you're wanting to go more towards we're going to close her to that 25 like now it starts to get pretty challenging so scientifically the research was to just it's going to be equally effective practically it's challenging for people to hit sufficient volume without just being so demoralized afterwards because there's so much pain they can't get out of their car because their legs are so trash they can't sit in the toilet and get back up without crying from pain so that's not good no that's not good I say that because those are actual examples that have happened in my life yeah I I'm realizing as we're having this conversation about ways to stimulate hypertrophy that I've sort of defaulted to more intensity as opposed to volume because of the time factor I have a lot of other things going on in my life and so within that hour I can't get enough sets in across all the muscle groups I need to hit and I'm only going to do it about once a week and so it's at least for me more advantageous to just train extremely hard I actually use the pre-exhaustion technique that you mentioned before yep pre-fatigue is you refer to it of hitting something really strong with the isolation exercise then doing compound exercises I'm starting to think based on what you've told me that pre-fatigue and then a compound exercise in some ways it's not really too sets because if you're going to failure forced reps you're kind of pushing past failure then you're doing a compound exercise and you're doing that two or three times well that sounds like four to six sets but the forced repetitions are almost like an additional set yep and so it's not 20 sets but it's four to six really really hard sets that go beyond what we normally think of as a set totally okay it's sort of the difference between running on concrete and running on sand when I go for a sand run it's a very different experience totally yep and this is why I should have mentioned this is a very very beginning of our our chat today but all of these numbers that I'll give you for any exercise that uptaste you you you cannot think of them as hard lines they are gradients and so when we think about the number for high virtue of you then terms of repetitions I said four to 30 what do you think happens at three do you think I virtually just stops right in fact the number you'll see in literature is more like six to 30 I actually slide it down to four though like personal preference because of that but it's just fades away what do you think happens at rep 31 35 there's no it just fades gradually over time so you actually sort of brought this up one of your other questions and I'm not sure if you were even thinking about this or maybe you were I just babble on about something else but if strength happens between this like one to five repetition range and I perfectly typically happens in this like eight to 30 range what happens if I were due to sets of six or got for bid seven like seven and nine are these numbers you just absolutely don't do a strength training right just like set to one two three four five six got eight ten twelve like do not program a set of third now and I'm training sets of seven and nine it's great we'll use sets of seven a lot with wait wait look at this because you can actually count numbers more effectively but what happens in seven to nine range so this is actually wonderful area of these five to eight repetitions where you're going to get a nice combination of a lot of strength gains and a lot of hypertrophy so someone who's coming in going man I want to get stronger and I want to add muscle what do I do here well that's actually really nice answer train pretty hard in that like four to eight repetition range and you're going to get a lot stronger and you'll still induce a lot of hypertrophy if you want to really maximize hypertrophy I would probably spend most of your time in the eight to fifteen repetition per set range you can go up to thirty admittedly though I don't think it's optimal to spend most of your time at more than fifteen reps per set it's very challenging to maintain the focus required at rep twenty seven to actually get sufficient failure by rep 30 you just you just give up way too early it's hard to do the same thing at the bottom and in that spectrum in terms of of really heavy to get there so I really honestly think eight to 15 is it's cliche it's that textbook number but that's a reason that's a textbook it is tried and true and very very very effective if for instance you want to get stronger though and not invoke a lot of hypertrophy you have a couple of tricks you can pull number one stay south of that five repetition range you do sets of one sets of two go as heavy as you can with all appropriate considerations and stick with them maybe even up to three reps per set you start getting the four to five to six now you're going to start itching towards that that hypertrophy range so stay down there do we lot more total sets so do a classic example would be something like eight sets of three right you're going to get a lot of practice you're going to get twenty four very high quality reps with a lot of rest in between okay you go from there you go to managing caloric intake making sure your protein is still on point you want to recover but if your total calories aren't you know greater than ten to fifteen percent above your maintenance needs then you're not going to be able to put on a whole bunch of muscle mascaritas don't have the fuel for it you can also then space your workouts out so that stimulus isn't coming extremely often so if you do that thing a couple of times a week it's not enough frequency and that signal so remember that signal has to be frequent or loud you didn't make it super loud and now you're not making a super frequent you can get very very very strong like that and and put on very low amounts of hypertrophy if that's sort of the choice so you told us a lot about volume and frequency and how that relates to protein synthesis and recovery to evoke the hypertrophy adaptation response how should people think about systemic damage in recovery because obviously the nervous system and the weight interacts with the neuromuscular system is the site of all the action here or at least a lot of the action here and the nervous system can in fact become fatigued you know that has a great capacity but the whole system that we're talking about can be worked to the extent that even if a muscle group like the bicepps or the back is being allowed to rest while you're training legs and other muscle groups that your whole neuromuscular needs rest how does one determine whether or not your entire body needs complete rest or low level active rest or exercise of a different kind yeah yeah sure so i want to actually tackle this because we're on the topic of hypertrophy i'm assuming that that's the goal in mine here yes here i'm asking specifically when the complex of hypertrophy i realize that for other training goals that the answer this question could be quite different yeah okay so we actually just in a couple different ways let's start local and work back to systemic right because number one what you're really concerned about is at the local muscle level is am i gonna create excessive damage and i don't necessarily mean muscle damage i mean injury right so um the kind of rule thumb we use is like three out of ten in terms of so or less if you're more than three out of ten in terms of so or less um i'm gonna start asking questions if you're higher than six out of ten we're probably not training this is subjective and total subjective measure right and you'll you'll know very quickly right if you're like if you can barely graze your pack with your fingertip and then you're like oh i don't care what you score that we're not training there's this no damage if you're three and a ten if you're just like oh i'm kind of like a little bit stiff here but once you get warmed up you start feeling okay you're probably okay i'm sure proceed there so that is is a very easy way to just think about so or less you're gonna be a little bit tight depending on your training frequency now zooming out to systemic we use a whole host of things so we actually have a whole host of bowel markers we use you can get a lot of these from blood so you can look at things like creatine kinase that's the very common one marker of muscle damage um we'll actually look at um LDA to look at my olgolablin um that's just like if you think about hemoglobin is the is the molecule that carries oxygen throughout your blood the mild globin is the part of that that's actually in muscle so when muscle gets broken down that gets leaked out and put in your blood that's one of the markers actually is gonna be associated with things like rabdo which is uh like you're gonna see your urine is purple and it's extremely dark because you got so much muscle breakdown that happens and kinase gets a problem and you put a bunch of stuff in there so we use those biomarkers we'll actually also look at probably a couple of things you're familiar with ALT and ASC these are excellent biomarkers of muscle breakdown so if we are actually suspecting that this is a chronic problem we're gonna actually go and amend pulse and blood um if it's just like i'm super sore today we're gonna use that subject to marker but if we're seeing this as constant man are we really pushing you way too much is there some sort of systemic problem we're going to blood and we're gonna look at all those different things now AST to ALT is really specific and I don't want to take us too far off track here but the ratio to those things is actually very important as well so if you look at the AST to ALT ratio typically the number will look at as like 1.67 as that ratio is like hard in that you have a pretty high risk of muscle damage but really between you know me and you and a few of these listeners anytime we start seeing AST out kick ALT we're immediately thinking it is in the ratio being higher than one we're immediately thinking like there's something happening muscle damage why so um that's actually sneaky get indicator of just total muscle mass um because the fast majority that's gonna be in muscle so um those are actually some markers that we like a lot if muscle damage is uh the thing we're concerned with if we are more concerned with things like total training volume systemic overload then we may turn to something more like sleep there's a lot of information we can actually get blamed from changes in sleep um behavior and function um you could also look at things like HRV heart rate variability which is a very classic marker and much more sensitive to changes with training than something like a resting heart rate which is which is one thing you can actually do that's totally cost-free just look at your changes uh and any elevation resting heart rate over time especially more than three to five consecutive days it is indicator but HRV is much more sensitive two things like training induced overload so that's a quick version of stuff that we're gonna pay attention to the last one I would add there is simply motivation so if you're really training heart and you like training heart and you just like cannot force yourself to go anymore that enough of itself can be a good indication of it's maybe not the day maybe not the week um with all of these things you want to be careful about overreacting to a single day measure again we look we need to look at at least a trend of more than three days honestly I'm looking at more than five days I'm gonna pull back from that and think about what phase of training we're in what part of the year we're in typically we're out the joint in the season preseason postseason offseason etc to make our decision about what we're going to do about it are we canting the entire workout are we doing a modified lower version lower intensity my default generally if type purchase the goal remember volume is the driver there so if I can like can we get in can we go real light let's go to six out of ten RPE so relative perceived exertion maybe we'll reduce the range of motion maybe we'll make it a little bit easier maybe go to machines or instead of going a squat we'll just do you know like essentially something like that but I want to still get enough volume in there that will keep you on target and any again even going at 50% not not to high repetition 50% for a set of 10 three sets just get a nice blood flow in there get it in get it out aid in recovery and then move on and come back the next day that's probably what I would do rather than canting the entire session how do other forms of exercise combine with hypercontraining for instance can I do cardiovascular training for two or three days per week provided that cardiovascular training is a low enough intensity and not disrupt high-perchrophy progression and can I do that cardiovascular exercise before or after the high-perchary training or does it need to be separated out the answer to this is really what we call the crossover interference effect okay it's really an energy management issue so the only time endurance exercise starts to interfere or block or hindr, attenuate hyperotrophy is in one of two broad categories number one total energy intake or your balance is off so you can amillirate this by just eating more if you do that then the interference effect generally goes away the second one is you want to make sure you avoid exercise forms for your endurance training that are the same working group and specifically the eccentric portion so for example we see much more interference with running on like hyperchary than we lose cycling right less eccentric pounding and loading less damage less things to recover from the tissue seems to be totally fine the only other thing you need to worry about here is total volume of your endurance work so if you're doing a moderate intensity for a moderate duration say 70% of your maximum heart rate for 25 minutes it's unlikely to do much damage in terms of blocking hyperchary you're totally fine do you can you do it before or after your workout it's probably not gonna matter that much alright so pre fatigue is okay for hyperchary so if your pre fatigue is coming from endurance then you're totally fine not a big deal afterwards cool you want to break it up into multiple sessions that's probably better right so if you do your endurance work on a separate day that's probably best case scenario if you can't do that but you can break it up into two workouts say you lift in the morning then you do your quote unquote cardio at night maybe that's the second best third best is doing it at the end of your lift and finishing it that's fine just make sure that you're maximizing your recovery on all the other tricks we'll talk about later make sure the calories are there make sure you're not doing a lot of eccentric landing in that endurance stuff and you'll be just fine and where does higher intensity cardio fit into a hyperchirp program so higher intensity cardio for instance in my mind is getting on the assault bike and doing you know eight intervals of 20 seconds sprint and 10 second rest in between or perhaps going to feel then doing some balance and sprint and things that sort not going all out not up you know running for one's life but getting you up to about you know 85 90% of running for one's life sure so we have a lot less information on the potential interference or not of high intensity stuff um this stuff we do have suggested it may actually aid in hypertrophy and that's because if you think about it one the potential past to activation the muscle growth is this metabolic disturbance you're going to get that a lot with the high intensity interval thing so it's not a terrible thing to do I wouldn't do it to the level that it compromises your ability to come back into your primary training so if you're so fatigue your legs are super heavy the depleted you now have to ingest extra carbohydrate to replenish muscle glycogen to be able to handle both recovery and continue training etc that could then lead to a problem but in general we really don't see any reason why that is going to completely block or make it such that your training was going to be wasted or didn't work and in fact actually a very recent study came out where they had individuals performed six weeks of purely aerobic endurance steady state long duration endurance for six weeks I think prior to starting a hypertrophy phase compared that to individuals who did not do that and those folks that did these six weeks of just I think it was cycling actually just endurance work had more muscle growth at the end of their hypertrophy training than those folks that did not so this shows you very clearly there are a lot of advantages that come with being physically fit to growing muscle so folks that also have actually hit plateau so a lot one of the things you may actually see some benefit from is actually doing a little bit more endurance work whether it's a steady state stuff maybe it's the higher intensity stuff certainly if you're starting a training phase it's a pretty good idea to do that and there's a number of physiologic reasons of why that's potentially occurring but the lowest hanging fruit here is weak sort of joking you know like if you're so unfit that you're tying your shoes and your warm up and you're already breaking a sweat you probably don't have enough fitness to do enough training to get enough hypertrophy so that is in fact your limiting factor you're not recovering you're super fatigued and damaged and sore because you're so unfit so get fit first and then you can actually get more gains a week later so you have to kind of kick the canned on the road for a few weeks but ten weeks later you'll be in a better spot than you were by investing a little bit in your conditioning so as you pointed out before and I can only assume you were referring to me hypertrophy training is idiot proof meaning there's a lot of leeway in the variables but not so much leeway that people can do anything it's bounded by these general principles so with your permission I'm going to do a brief overview of my notes based on your description of the modifiable variables that will direct somebody towards hypertrophy keeping in mind this backdrop of exercise choice exercise order selecting appropriate volume that sets in reps training frequency and needing some metric or way to have progression either by adding more way to or by more tension or more metabolic stress and so on in terms of exercise choice it sounds like the choice of exercises is not super critical in terms of specificity but that the ideal circumstances that people are targeting all the major and frankly secondary and minor muscle groups if you can even call them that across their exercise choices that their picking exercises that they can perform safely and that they can generate enough intensity so that they get in close to failure without placing themselves into danger right so for some people that might mean including large compound freeway exercises like squats and dead lifts and bent over barbro rows as well as isolation exercises and for some people there might be a bias toward more isolation exercises and machines but of course machines don't necessarily mean that you can't use heavy loads in fact plate loaded machines like hammer strength machines and allow for quite substantial loads so picking two or three or more movements per muscle group can be valuable but that overall consistency is going to outshine variation in the sense that you don't need to hit muscles with a different exercise every workout coming back to the same thing has a benefit and we heard about this in our discussion around strength and power as well okay in terms of order of exercises there too it sounds like there's a lot of flexibility one could do the large compound exercise for let's say quadriceps and hamstrings and glutes first like a squat or a front squat or could deadlift for that matter but then if one deadlifted in primarily hit the glutes and hamstrings then you might want to target the quadriceps more directly with leg extensions or if one squatted and was loading the squat bar carrying the squat bar in a way that was predominantly quadriceps and less so glute and hamstring then leg curls will be a good choice it's okay and train your calves folks very important unless you're a genetic freak of course it's actually a good opportunity to say unless you're a genetic freak or you just have a genetic pre-disposition or you've done sports and you have a genetic pre-disposition that gives you you know very large calves that don't require any training at all I know people like this they're there's somewhat rare but they're out there yeah and those folks sometimes want to stay away from or minimize their training you told me that even if you have a muscle group that's a hyper responder in terms of hyper-perjury getting at least one or two good hard sets per week is good because you want to keep functionality in that neuromuscular system. Love it okay in terms of volume again we have large round of variation is what I'm hearing that the total number of sets per week is a strong driving force of program design and selection that ideally you're performing 10 to 20 and probably more like 15 to 20 sets per week and that could be divided up across multiple workouts were done in one workout but that's 10 to 20 sets per week per muscle group not really taking into account indirect activation so that would be 10 to 20 sets for biceps your back work is going to hit your biceps a little bit maybe a bit more depending on the exercise selection but it's really 10 to 20 and given that hyper-chirfee can still occur and maybe it occurs better with more volume then don't include the indirect work unless something about the architecture of your body and the inability to engage certain muscle groups like makes a pull-up really an arm exercise for you you have that right the way that I would maybe define it is typically with movements we consider to be there to be primary movers secondary movers and then tertiary right if it is a primary or secondary I'm probably counting it if it's tertiary or less I'm probably not counting it got it so going back to our example of a pull-up so in the example of a pull-up I probably wouldn't count the biceps and a pull-up but I would probably count the biceps during a chin-up would you count the rear deltoid in a pull-up it probably not maybe like it just depends probably not though okay train the rear deltoid also the that's only the honestly the reason I answered that is because most people don't do anything for the real-dore delts anyways but they should right absolutely that's why I didn't want to count it I wanted you to go out of your way to make sure you did something specifically for the real-dore delts for aesthetics and for functionality and balance across the shoulders totally neck shoulder all of it I'm so happy to hear you say this I'm a huge fan of people doing rear deltoid work for all the reasons you described and neck work for that matter I think people forget that the neck is the upper part of your spine and for postural reasons and for stabilization safety reasons it's really critical but I think most people aren't familiar with how best to train the rear deltoids and neck and I know a number of people are afraid of getting a big neck which for reasons that are still unclear to me is referred to as no neck but let's leave out that no neck comment for the moment what are some good exercises for targeting the rear deltoids and neck safely that people can perform for stabilization and for hypertrophy yeah I would recommend people check out Eric Kressy he's a wonderful strength-efficient coach he actually is I think the director of pitching for the New York Yankees now is that spelled C-R-E-S-S-I-E-C-R-E-S-S-E-Y I believe and he's got facility in I believe Boston as well as in Florida so he's very very involved in pitching as well as hockey and things like that so he has so many free videos and resources on so much of the shoulder girdle mostly because he he's dealt with overhead and throwing athletes and so the precision required there is tremendous so you want to be very careful when you start playing in this area because the wrong positioning of your scapula can cause a whole bunch of problems in your neck and low back and so he would be a great resource to go take a look at that depending on how your scapula's are lighting and sliding and the way that you want your rotator comes firing your rhomboids there's it's like very complicated very quickly so you want to learn more go there as a very very quick couple of answers one of my favorite exercises is lying on a bench or putting some advantage and then just doing a reverse fly basically the reason I like stabilizing the rest of the body so you can make sure you can focus on just using those rear doll toys and putting your scapula's in the right position now there's a there's a specific set of queuing that you want the scapula to move down and back for again check out air corinion number of folks in that area to do it but that's a very simple way the reverse fly to get there great and then in terms of neck exercises it was told to avoid bridges because they can cause damage to the discs would probably never do a range of the rest of my life so um isometrics are a great exercise for that because if you think about what you're asking muscle groups to do and then neck you mostly want it to be able to do a certain type of rotation a little bit of flex and extension and some some other movements but in general it should be being stable so you want to walk through these joints but asking kind of what they do are they moving joint or they stability joint in this case you want to do there so isometrics are going to put you in a much better position there's some actually pretty cool devices that you can wear and you can put them on your head and you can do all kinds of movement and get some great training there those are great starts but if you don't have any of that just basic isometrics are great we're going to go about it um neck bridges would not be on that list for game no neck bridges folks in terms of sets and repetitions we briefly touch on this but anywhere from I believe six repetitions all the way up to 30 repetitions but probably more in the eight to 15 repetition range for hypertrophy most of the time yeah and I'll just throw in there because I love this idea that if you want to get a relatively balanced adaptation related to strength and hypertrophy that seven to nine range the the no man's or no woman's land of training repetitions I always joking class I'm like okay we go the whole thing right you're like one to five strength eight to twelve you know hypertrophy like right and then I'm like okay so six nine means nothing will happen at all because you're just like writing down like all right good way to for everybody to remember that there are adaptations triggered in the six to nine rep range and it's a balance of strength and height you'll just get thrown out of any gym that I'm a part of if you just do that so but the important point is to get close to failure and occasionally hit failure maybe occasionally throw in a forest repetition or a rest pause where you rest in and do a few more something like that but those intensity increasing maneuvers will require a little bit more attention to recovery either time or attention in some other way and here's a little bit of care it off to what people because people generally don't like to be told to not go to failure that often right so there's a handful of like half the folks are like sweet I don't have to train that hard to get there and those folks it's like well yes but also said you just can't like do a half workout you have to get pretty down and close to failure and most people don't really know failure means so for that group it's actually it's still probably harder than you think you want to train the other group though they'll like wants to completely blow themselves out every single time dragging them back is more the key now for those folks here's what I can say if you make sure that your hidden stressors and visible stressors are completely taken care of you can go to failure a lot more often and so you need to dial those things in and then now you can go hammer yourself because you'll recover so much quicker and we see this very commonly in all of our programs with our athletes and and our non athletes that when we get the rest of the hidden and visible stressors taking care of their training volume goes up so much because they'll just start coming back and then it's like oh my god I'm not sore anymore oh my god I'm not nearly sore I did this exact workout you know countless times before and now I'm doing it and I'm not sore at all and what the hell like we didn't do anything different with the programming or really the nutrition but we got the rest of that alastatic load under control and boom things take off so a lot like drivers so many people seem to be riding the break and so many people seem heavy on the accelerator yeah that's actually one of the ways we describe it is like you want to go faster people's inclination step one is to hit the gas our our step number one is making sure your left foot's not on the break you'll go faster with less resistance which means you'll actually wear it down the system a lot slower by just taking your foot off the break first if you're then not going fast enough now we can push the accelerator but I'm not pushing that accelerator while your foot's still on the break you're going to go a little faster but not as fast as you should be going with that much work and you're going to start wearing down break pedals and things like that so I like that analogy so hitting that 10 to 20 sets per week repetition range is pretty broad provided you get close to failure hit failure every once in a while could be the final set of checks or size or maybe do one workout where you hit failure on everything but then you don't do it for a few more again there sounds like there's a lot of play in the system here rest ranges anywhere from 30 seconds all the way up to three or four minutes depending on how heavy you're training and how close to failure or to failure maybe even quote unquote beyond failure if there is such a thing you're training throwing in negatives and things like that we didn't get into really high intensity techniques but people again vary and extend to which they're pushing the system but there does seem to be some value to mixing up the rest between set ranges across exercises and across workouts but you could combine them all in the same workout is what I heard and then in terms of progression it sounds to me like the goal when high virtue of be training is not necessarily to add more weight to the bar although that's one way one could do it but that the progression actually can arrive through this really extensive kit of changing the speed of movement changing the number of sets adding some volume maybe changing the split so that you go from three day a week full body work out to more of a body parts one or two body parts per day every other day or two on one off any number of different variations that are out there sounds like all of these can and will work provided that people are obeying the general principles of this hypertrophy adaptation inducing protocol that you describe and that they are meeting the necessary but not sufficient variables as well such as sleep, nutrition and managing the stress in the rest of their life do I have that correctly? Yeah that's really really good one more thing I'd like to add is this is a situation for hypertrophy in which there are some exercises that actually don't think are good ideas so I want to make sure we include those in the conversation that's not a serothe case for strength and you can really do kind of whatever when you want and that is specifically plyometrics although in fact if you look at there's a recent review paper came out showing the like plyometrics are effective as well for I personally like one can do almost anything as long as it falls within this parameter set the concepts are few in the methods you're and the methods for hypertrophy are many in general though plyometrics are not my first second or even like hundredth choice for hypertrophy they if there are part of a total training program and you get some of our hypertrophy as a result cool you're lucky not the first place I'm going the other major category are weightlifting variations so that when I'm saying weightlifting I mean specifically Olympic weightlifting as a snatch clean and jerk and their variations those are just not a good exercise choice it's not that they don't work and it's just the risk to benefit ratio starts to fall pretty fast in a negative favor and so it's just not worth doing sets of 10 of a snatch unless you're in a sport or that's like the competition or whatever but if the goal is simply hypertrophy choose different exercises than that great now I realize that we are going to do entire episodes related to nutrition supplementation recovery etc but I'd like to just touch on two or three specific topics and questions that come up a lot around the question of hypertrophy specifically and that probably also relate to strength training and training for speed so I'm going to ask these in not rapid fire I'll give you shorter answers so put it out so I'll ask these questions now but with the caveat that we will get into these topics in much more depth very soon the first question is about the use of cold showers and ice baths and cold water exposure which I know many people use for resilience training to increase their dopamine which it does and for recovery but there's also this issue of when one should use cold that is deliberate cold exposure relative to hypertrophy training specifically and that's because I've heard that if deliberate cold exposure is done too soon after I have hypertrophy adaptation do seem workout yeah all sorts of things we've been talking about that the hypertrophy response can be blunted reduced or eliminated is that true and if so when could people do deliberate cold exposure while still also including hypertrophy training in their program and still get hypertrophy great so you know I'm a lover of the cold I still have a deep freezer in my house that is filled with water at all times that I's plugged in and is a frozen chamber I still do the old school style of it please unplug it before you get in it each oh yes absolutely and then don't do it by yourself so that the lid goes on top of you and then we don't see you sort of ever again hung out the hun so low effect it's time for me to upgrade me one of these new fancy ones but I've been using this for so many years so I love it obviously I've been involved with XBT and and Gabby and Laird and Brian McKenzie and these folks so I've been doing this stuff for a long time of but I don't even know how many hunters of folks into the ice and that of a lot of reasons so there are a lot of benefits and we could talk about those later however that that being said it is very very true you do not want to get in the ice post-ifer hypertrophy training you wouldn't want to do that immediately after the workout you probably don't want to do it before the workout and you probably don't even want to do it that same day it is just not worth it it will blunch I virtually in specifically we've talked earlier about what's driving muscle growth is that signaling cascade through that gene expression through that muscle protein synthesis cold exposure blocks that signal remember adaptation comes from stress you've put in a stress run now you've blocked that stress you've literally blocked this signal that tells your body come back and grow exercise so not a good idea to do it if you're training for some other purposes maybe strength maybe there's an argument there although maybe not for speed and power maybe you can get away with the endurance maybe a separate conversation if you're in season I have no problem using it immediately after a game the goal is entirely different even if we did a hypertrophy type of training program we're not doing it try to match try to maximize growth and that particular case our priority for recovery is higher than our priority for muscle growth so we choose optimization in that category you can only make those choices though when you truly understand what is the goal for the day the week the month the phase of training and really what part of the year you're in we have that all plotted out for for all the people we work with so I know when we want to choose one over the other it's not a this is the choice you always make this situation that's it's not how we operate we need more precision than that so that being said we're generally not going to do it if we want to do a lot of icing during a phase in which we're using a lot of hypertrophy we're going to do a couple of things number one we may just not use it so there are phases in our training where I don't want to maximize recovery I'm not going to give you any tricks here I'm not going to do ice or any of the other methods we're going to talk about why because the whole point is to cause overload that's what's going to be the stimuli to cause adaptation if all I'm doing is blocking that stuff, attenuating it smashing it back down I'm undercutting myself I'm choosing to fill a little bit better to have a little bit better performance right now knowing that's going to compromise results I'm going to get six eight ten twelve weeks for now right so I'm not going to choose it all in reality if it is if I really am trying to maximize hypertrophy I'm probably not doing any ice work through that whole phase maybe like my off day I know that's similar to a setup you have like one day a week when I'm not training will jump into my ice maybe even do some hot cold contrast I love the XPC protocol it's you know we've probably talked about it before that's a great setup or it's not dooderdal right it's just not something we need when we move into another phase of training where we're trying to maximize adaptation or maximize the result and get the benefit of that training now we're going to hedge more towards recovery and we're going to bring in some of these strategies and techniques and not worry about causing the most stimuli there because we're trying to attenuate because we're trying to actualize the work we did six eight ten twelve weeks before what about cold showers so do those have the same hypertrophy blunting effect in general no in general you can do cold showers that's not going to be a problem you're not going to be in there very long and you're not going to get nearly as cold as you will submerge in 30 degree ice water like that the way that we do it nonetheless so I have no problem standing in the shower for a couple of minutes using it for other reasons if you want to that's no issue I'd like to talk a little bit about nutrition and supplementation as it relates to hypertrophy Dr. Lane Norton who's been a guest on the Hebrew and lab podcast and we both know throughout a number range related to protein intake on the backdrop of how much protein synthesis can occur by meal across the day etc a lot of a lot of research done there and some important work by him in particular and then the value that he threw out was 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight being the lower end of the range up to I believe as it was as high as 2.4 maybe even as high as 2.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day that's a pretty broad range but it's on the higher end of what I think most people think of in terms of protein intake and then again some people might already be right there or maybe even above that value of course this all depends on whether or not people are omnivore vegan meat based etc we won't even go there but assuming people are getting enough protein per day so somewhere in that range and they are spreading out that protein intake to accommodate the fact that the body can only assimilate a certain amount of protein in any given sitting what do you like to see people ingest at some point post hypertrophy inducing workout in order to get the protein synthesis advantage if you will that is stimulated by that workout. Earlier you mentioned the post training feeding window in the 90s and probably earlier people were talking about oh you know within the first 90 minutes you have to get 30 minutes of excuse me a certain number of grams of carbohydrate and protein etc I think now the understanding is that that window is much broader and how broad and etc is still a matter of debate but when somebody is training specifically for her hypertrophy assuming they are getting enough protein from quality sources in their other meals and assuming that their overall macro nutrient intake and caloric intake is high enough that is they have enough of a caloric surplus that they have the raw materials for for hypertrophy. What do you like to see people ingest at some point post workout in order to facilitate muscle protein synthesis and recovery and this could include nutrition and supplementation if you want to divide those answers out feel free to do so. Okay great so Ton of work came out of Don Lamin's lab was actually Lamin's mentor as well as Stu Phillips at McMaster so Ton of work there and we can answer a number of things here so Lane's numbers that he recommended also notice about a gram approaching per pound of body weight it's a great start now once you slide below that's per pound right one gram per pound right and earlier which is also make sure because we're changing units here it was 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight all the way up to you I think it was 2.4 but maybe a size 2.7 yeah grams of protein per kilogram of body weight so 2.2 in that unit would be the same thing so 2.2 grams per kilogram is the same as 1 gram per pound right so depending on which or you're listening to this at one of those maybe easier than the other for you. If you start getting below that number now you do start running into questions of protein quality protein type and protein timing this is one of the reasons why I actually fully agree with Lane is just get that number higher than you think and then all those other variables don't matter if that number is low then you need to start paying attention to a bunch of other stuff you've added now complexity up to your program things you got to pay attention to just stay high and you need to doesn't matter and so you can just leave a lot of those things off the table that seems to be fairly clear in the work of some of those gentlemen I just mentioned that as long as you get to that total number the question about timing and types and quality it seems to matter a lot less in fact a stew's recent work and non animal based proteins it really show that to be fairly clear that those are quite effective assuming total protein intake is high enough they amount of loose in and other amino acids in those extra proteins matter less if the total threshold is super high so just do that and you're fine now the other caveat we have to say here is timing of macronutrients is seems to be somewhat irrelevant for protein but that is not the case for carbohydrates so that timing does matter replenishment of muscle glycogen is very specific and you want to make sure that that is around a lot if you're doing either maintaining training quality or you're sliding into endurance type of work and so nutrient timing does matter with carbohydrates maybe less so the protein is certainly less so with protein if the total protein in gestion is high enough so it depends on what we're going after in terms of a training goal and where we want to get where they say in general the way that we like to think about this is if you're doing a strength type of work where you're truly targeting that then a one-to-one post exercise protein to carbhydrate ratio is generally what we're going to go after so this would be something like 35 grams of protein and 35 grams of carbohydrate it doesn't have to be post it can be pre or my favorite is actually mid or post but somewhere in that range especially if you're training the morning and you have not consumed anything prior to your workout and that's not necessarily eating in the middle of the workout that's drinking calories yeah it's going to be a yes to see so I'm eating a sandwich in the gym although I'm sure it's happened yeah so one-to-one is that like sort of standard number here if you're going to do sort of more of a really hard conditioning workout that number slides up to something like three or even four to one which would be carbohydrate to protein ratio so if we want to stay at 35 grams of protein we're going to go maybe as high as like a hundred or 140 grams of carbohydrate getting depending on what type of training we're starting to do if you're going to do a little bit of a combination then you like a little bit of strength a little bit of conditioning and kind of a standard workout which is probably something that a lot of people then you maybe want to go to something like two to one so you know 35 grams of protein 60 70 grams of carbohydrate and those are kind of just like rough numbers that you can go buy and for pure hypertrophy training would you like to see people ingest some carbohydrate post training for pure hypertrophy training I want to see that as many of those nutrients around the training is generally possible now again I may change my mind when our fasting study comes out but as it stands now there is no advantage to not feeling around the training and there are some known and some other potential advantages to feeling so I just see no reason to not do it in fact most people are generally going to do better now this is not science this is just my coaching experience and this is with our athletes and all of our non athletes that we've worked with and do work with they're just going to be better spreading those meals out generally throughout the day and they're going to be better if they have those nutrients either pre-made or post and so they're going to get even for hypertrophy they're going to get something like that one three to one ratio of carbs of protein personal preference some people don't like to eat before they train some people have to eat before they train some people can't you know put in food in their belly immediately after work around that you can play based on personal preference but we want that feeling in there because we want to maximize the potential growth and we want to just get a jump start on recovery because we're going to be training again pretty soon supplementation is a huge topic and one that we will go into it in great depth and soon to occur episode but if you had to pick one supplement that can benefit most everybody if not everybody for their training directed toward strength power and hypertrophy what would that supplement be and how would you like to see people use it meaning how much should they take and when should they take it sure if you don't count protein and carbohydrates as supplements they technically are but pull this walk out of it sorry I should be more specific I'm not referring to a non food form um protein and carbohydrates so powdered protein and powdered powdered carbohydrate etc um it technically are supplements they're highly processed but they're um but I'm not including that I'm referring to non macronutrient types supplement yeah does testosterone cal um well in the context of this discussion it's uh testosterone that people are manufacturing themselves okay the cheating kind the endogenous kind no um I mean creatine is the answer here without question it is the most well studied it is the most effective and it's uh benefits are robust meaning they're going to confer positive adaptations across multiple physiological domains so and we could certainly have a very long chat about some of the interesting things that people in fact we just had um during candow on our barbell shrug podcast and he went into extensive detail about all the benefits of creatine that people have no idea about including things like bone mineral density you asked about that earlier it's creatine is actually fairly effective for that let alone the thing uh the benefit and things like cognitive function decision making memory um the work that they're being done there for neurological disorders um depression a whole host of things that that creatine is being studied for some of those studies show a lot of benefits some of it show maybe a little bit some none but there's just a lot of things creatine can do um so when we could talk about muscle recovery or muscle hypertrophy um that's where the bulk of the research is and and and it's very effective um in terms of type creatine on a hydrate is still the best one and that's just because as a largest evidence space um you can maybe make some arguments for some other types but you're really going to reach saturation pretty quickly within a matter of weeks and they're um at a dose of germany where between like three to six grams per day um now five grams is the very standard number we give reality is I change that number based on size that's just the truth um if you're 225 pounds you're not going to get the same dose of creatine as 125 pound girl that's just like this is not what we're going to do so we may slide that number down a little bit closer to three for the smaller a girl boy doesn't matter it's just female physical size if you're one of our 275 or 330 pound offensive right tackles and the NFL you're not going to get the same dosage everybody else so that number is going to go up to seven eight nine maybe even 10 grams a day there so that's this kind of a scale in general if you want to need the answer five grams is the standard taken after training the timing doesn't matter totally irrelevant take it in the morning breakfast take it night take it in time you want to take it pre we tend to put it in a lot of people's um workout um shakes just to make sure they get it out the day but the timing is irrelevant great well thank you for that very informative answer and I look forward to much more discussion about nutrition and supplementation and recovery and all the rest in the episodes to come this was incredibly informative thank you so very much I appreciate the opportunity I had a great time doing that I love talking about these things I also really like talking about

thank you for your interest in science"
vid00007," Welcome to the Human Lab guest series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks the first in a series with Dr. Andy Galpin. Dr. Andy Galpin is a professor of canesiology at Cal State University Fullerton, and one of the foremost world experts on the science and application of methods to increase strength, speed, endurance, hypertrophy, and various other aspects of fitness, exercise, and sports performance. Across the six episode series, Dr. Andy Galpin pulls from his expertise working with everything from professional athletes to recreational exercises, and teaches us the mechanisms, logic, and specific protocols for how to achieve any of the number of different exercise adaptations that I mentioned a moment ago, ranging from strength to endurance, hypertrophy, and everything in between. We get really far into details, but at all times paying attention to the macroscopic issues that is how to create a program for endurance or strength or hypertrophy or speed, or one that combines all of those. We also talk about supplementation and nutrition and how to maximize recovery for each of the different types of exercise adaptations. During today's episode, Dr. Galpin teaches us how to assess our level of fitness, and more generally how to think about fitness, so that we can best achieve our fitness exercise and performance goals. Dr. Professor Andy Galpin, super excited to have you here. You're such an immense treasure trove of information on physical training and optimizing for specific goals and outcomes with physical exercise. I'm curious, however. So many people have different levels of fitness. Some people are professional athletes, of course, but most people are not. Many people exercise regularly. Some people are trying to do that more. Some people are doing too much of that. They're overtraining. They're not recovering enough. If we were to take a step back and each and every one of us ask, how fit are we? With the word fit, of course, being a very broad encompassing word, couldn't compass endurance. Certainly does strength. The ability to run fast even if for short distances. It might even include hypertrophy or directed hypertrophy, trying to balance one's musculature to offset asymmetries, recover from injuries, et cetera. How should I, or anyone else for that matter, think about their level of fitness? I know my resting heart rate, but what do I do in terms of really assessing whether or not I'm as fit as I could be and should be both for sake of health and performance? And here I'm asking you the question not as an athlete, but as somebody who's been pretty consistent as an exerciseer, if we were to throw our arms around this question of how do we assess our fitness? What would be sort of the different levels of assessment that we should think about and do? When it comes to exercise, people generally have two major goals in mind. Goal number one is achieving some sort of appearance. This is I want to be big or want to not be too big or I want to be lean. It doesn't matter what that goal is, but there is an aesthetic component to almost everybody. And I want to look a certain way or not look a certain way. They have the one as functionality. So I want to be able to perform a certain way. Now again, that definition differs per person. So I want to be better at strength. I want to be better at mobility. I want to be able to have energy throughout the day, whatever it is. So there's some sort of appeal to aesthetic and there's some sort of appeal to functionality. So within both of those categories, we want to be in a position where we can understand where do I need to go with my exercise training so that I can be as fit and as health and as achieve these goals that I want now, as well as being a position where I can maintain them for a long period of time. So this blends both immediate goals. So say you're just interested in squatting a lot of weight. So you're interested in running a 5K time the best you want. It doesn't matter. It blends that with the ability to desire to have a long wellness span, to be fit throughout life to achieve all those things for as long as possible. So then the question kind of comes back to saying, how do I know which area I need to focus on the most and why am I not achieving these goals or how can I get there more effectively. And if we look at the big picture, we have to understand that there are several major components to physical fitness that are going to be required in all of these categories. And to achieve that, there are a handful of components that have to happen to be able to hit those goals. And now they're infinite methods. So the saying we actually use here a lot is the methods are many but the concepts are few. So what I'd love to do today is over the course of our discussion is hit exactly what those concepts are and then cover a whole bunch of different methods and we could do that for hours. But we'll cover a number of them for various goals. So one of the reasons I went into neuroscience and not into exercise science is because of this thing neuroplasticity that nervous systems ability to adapt. But the more time I spend with you and the more I learn from you, I realize that many if not all of the organ systems of our body have this incredible ability to adapt. And when we're talking about physical exercise, there are incredible adaptations that of course involve the nervous system but also involve muscle and connective tissue and so many other cell types and tissues. That said, when we talk about fitness, what are the major types of adaptations that underlie this thing that we call fitness? And later I know we're going to get into how different forms of exercise can trigger different types of adaptations. But what are the major adaptations that one can create in their body using exercise? There are many reasons why one should exercise and we could perhaps cover that later in our chats. But the physiological adaptations can be bucketed really in a nine areas. So the very first one is what I call skill or technique. So just learning to move better, more efficiently with a specific position and timing and sequence or whatever that is, this could be running more effectively. This could be practicing a skill like shooting a ball or an implement, swinging a golf club, anything like that. I call that skill development. The second one is speed. This is simply moving at a higher velocity or what they better rate of acceleration. That's very similar to the next one which is power and power is speed multiplied by force. The next one then of course on top of that is force or strength. Those are really synonymous terms, right? How effectively can you move something? Now this is often confused, strength rather as a muscular endurance. So what I mean by that is strength truly is a marker of how what's the maximum thing you can move or what's the maximum amount of force you can produce one time. It's not how many repetitions in a row you can do. That's actually another one of our adaptations called the muscular endurance. All right, so that is typically under the order of like say five to 25, maybe 50 repetitions. Think of a classic how many push-ups can you do in a row? I mean, he sit up, he's going to do in a minute. Things like that are muscular endurance, muscular endurance tends to be localized. So this is specific to just say your triceps and your deltoids. It's not a overall cardiovascular endurance marker or anything like that. So that's strength number four. Number five is muscle hypertrophy. And this is the first time now we're talking about an appearance. Rather than a functional outcome. Or moving faster, moving heavier, or indicators of how well you can move. This is the first one that's just simply how big is your muscle. And that's muscle hypertrophy or muscle size. After that is muscular endurance. So this is how many repetitions you can typically do of a movement. So think of how many push-ups in a row you can do. How many sit ups in a minute you can do things that are typically in like five to 50 repetition sort of range. And it is often or it is almost always local muscle. So what I mean by that is it is I don't push up test is really how many reps that your triceps and Packs and deltoids can do. It is not a cardiovascular endurance. It is not a global physiological endurance. It's specific to typically one or a few muscle groups at a time. This is why you have to do multiple tests for sort of every group there. After that now we've moved into number seven, which is what I call anaerobic capacity. This is more synonymous with maximum heart rate. And now we're actually looking at rather than a single movement or muscle group. It is a total physiological limitation. So it is the maximum amount of work you can do in say 30 to 45 seconds, maybe even up to 122 seconds of all outwork. Think of your classic interval type of stuff here. So how much work can you do at a maximum rate where you're going to enter tremendous amounts of global fatigue? The next pass that is maximum aerobic capacity. And this is probably something like in the eight to 15 minute range where you're going to reach probably both a maximum heart rate as well as a true VO2 max, which we'll talk a lot more about what that is later. So that is different from the previous one where you can't reach this in a matter of seconds. It simply takes multiple minutes to get to a position where your VO2 max is actually going to be sufficiently challenged or an indicator there. And then the last one number nine is what I call long duration. And this is just your ability to sustain sub-maximal work for a long period of time with no breaks, no reduction whatsoever. This is often called steady state training or a lot of people just think of this when they think of, quote unquote, cardio, but your ability to continue move without any breaks or change or drop is the last and final adaptation. And for long distance steady state, I'm guessing it exceeds 15 minutes because the previous one was eight to 15 minutes or so. What sort of time ranges are we talking about in terms of this long duration? Well that's actually one of what you're going to be anything past 15 minutes. So really if you look at a kind of a minimal number there's generally 20 minutes of what we're looking for, but a more typical would be 20 to 60 minutes. But anything past that would still be limited by your long duration endurance, so your ability to sustain work over time. Okay, so given that there are nine different major adaptations that can be induced with exercise of specific types. Is there any one global test or assessment that people can take or do that allows them to determine what level of ability of fitness they have in each and every one of these nine different categories? There are probably dozens or more tests that you can do for each one of those nine categories. And what I would actually like to do is walk you through my favorites for each and giving you both the scientific gold standard. So if you had the ability on limited resources what should you go do as well as some that are equipment free that are cost free things that anyone can do across the world. In addition to that, I want to walk you through what those numbers should be how do you identify if you really pour in something or if you're great. And then if you aren't as good maybe in a category and you want to get better at it exactly what to do in terms of protocols for how to achieve valve movements in each of those steps. So I know in your list of the nine different adaptations to exercise that you did not mention fat loss or health promoting benefits which are two reasons that a lot of people exercise. Was there a specific reason that you did not mention those? Absolutely, it's because those things are actually not specific training styles. They are byproducts of these nine. And the main thing about that is if you understand how fat loss occurs which we can certainly talk about, you'll realize some of these nine protocols are effective for fat loss and some are not. General health is the same thing when we understand what it actually means to be healthy from a physiological perspective. And now for what to train for is going to determine itself. So what I mean is looking at things like in order to be healthy, you have to have sufficient strength. You have to have cardiovascular fitness, you have to have sufficient muscle and etc. Therefore training for one's health is determined by those restrictions. So for you and Drew, you may need to do more strength training to be healthy. For me, because I'm strong already, way stronger than you, I may not need to do as much strength training. So our quote unquote health based protocols are based on our current status or limitations in physical fitness among these nine areas. So what I would like to do today is to cover a brief history of exercise science. And the reason is it's going to explain a lot about why people are not getting the goals in their exercise programs that they want, and so well as give you very specific direction about what to do instead. I can't wait to hear all the things that I'm doing incorrectly and to have you help me remedy that. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from Dr. Galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is however part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Momentus. Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The human-min lab podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentus for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations. With single ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation. Regiment for your goals. In addition, Momentus supplement ship internationally. This is of course important because we realize that many of the human-min lab podcasts listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the human-min lab podcast, in particular supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery, you can go to live-momentus spelled OUS, so that's live-momentus.com slash human. Today's episode is also brought to us by Element. Element is an electrolyte drink that contains exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium to optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance. Most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best. But what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of ourselves and nerve cells neurons in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios. Now, of course, people with pre-hypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake. But what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise, and in particular if you're falling a very clean diet, that is not a lot of processed foods, which of course is a good thing. Chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams, that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar.

Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 sleep. 8 sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've been using an 8 sleep mattress cover for about the last 8 months, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I'm sleeping about the same amount, but I'm sleeping far deeper, and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so-called rapid eye movement or REM sleep and slow wave sleep, and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically. The underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward. I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep at night, your body needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees in terms of core body temperature, and waking up involves a 1 to 3 degree increase in core body temperature. With 8 sleep mattress covers, you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be 1 temperature at the start of the night, a different temperature of the middle of the night, and a different temperature as you approach morning, each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep, and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever. If you'd like to try 8 sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com slash Huberman and check out their pod 3 cover and save $150 at checkout. 8 sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia.

Before we get into how the history of exercise science informs the mistakes that we are all making and how to remedy those mistakes, I'm curious as to whether or not you have any favorite 1 or 2 studies that point to a sort of naturally occurring example of how people can become very fit in one area and not another. You know, I'm familiar with seeing endurance athletes that apparently have terrific endurance, but at least to my eye don't look like they are particularly strong. I'm also familiar with seeing individuals that are very, very strong, particular in social media, but that don't look like they could walk up a flight of stairs much less run a mile. Do you have any examples of studies in or outside the laboratory that point to that in a concrete way? There's a lot to have to discuss here, but I'll answer it really clear. If you look across the literature, and this is actually back to as early as the mid 1950s, in fact it actually goes back to previous to that to the Harvard Fatigue Lab. In 1927 to 1947 area, people actually were advocating at that point a combination of strength training and endurance in the 1920s. Way back then, in fact it actually goes prior to that at the late 1880s, there's scientific evidence back that. It became more well developed in the mid 1950s and 60s. In fact, there was the initial stages of what's called the exercises medicine movement, which is the movement now, but the initial stages of that actually route back to the 1950s, and I could actually go into that whole discussion and the story of how that all came about. But that's the health as wealth. Montreux that came from the 1950s from the scientific community that. All those, those data points are going to suggest, you need a combination of some sort of broad strength training and broad endurance. Now, if you have a specific goal five months from now, you want to compete in a race or hit a certain physique, that's fine to focus on one area of training certainly if you're an athlete, that's different. But if you want to maximize health and overall functionality throughout time, it needs to be a combination. And I really, really highlight this. I can actually talk about a couple of studies that I've done. One of them we actually did in Stockholm, Sweden. So I did this at the Careless Institute, which you probably are aware of. It's actually one of the founding places of all of exercise physiology. Generally it started there. It was called something different back then, but really our entire field came out of Stockholm in the Careless Institute. And we worked with a whole bunch of cross country skiers that were in their 80s and 90s. And so they were competitive skiers in the 1940s and 50s, and they had been skiing competitively for that entire duration. So you're talking 50 to 60 consecutive years of competing. So there's 80 to 90 year olds living alone in healthy and we compared them to a group of individuals here in America who are the same age, but we're not exercising. And what we wanted to do is to see and kind of look at what are these lifelong endurance individuals. What do they look like? When we brought them into the lab, which is, by the way, amazing to do a Vio to Max test on a 92 year old, especially in language that they don't speak. And you're in a, you can imagine you're doing this in the hospital, right? And you're running people through, this is a cycling test. And so for a Vio to Max test, you have a mask on your face. You hooked up to a metabolic cart, so we can collect all the gases that are coming out of your mouth. And you're chanting these people on and basically every minute the workload gets harder and harder and harder until you can't complete it. And we're doing this in a cardiology center and the cardiologists are usually waiting for their heart rate to get slightly elevated and they stop them, because they're, you know, 85, 86 years old. And only we not stopping them, but we are screaming in their air system like go go go go and Swedish language. In English, right? And then the translator, but it doesn't take a lot of translation when someone's screaming at your face like go go go go. So we ran them through a whole bunch of Vio to Max test. And we did the same thing for those folks back here in America. And what was incredibly clear from that study was the Vio to Max, you can think about these numbers and this is what's called relative. So, and the relative terms are milliliters per kilogram per minute. And so a standard number is about 18 is what we call the line of independence. So if your Vio to Max is below 18 milliliters per kilogram per minute, it's very hard for you to live by yourself. So your fitness is so low, you probably are going to need to have somebody living with you or you'll need to be in some sort of assisted living home. So if you are in like Vio to Max of 20 or 21 or 22, you're not below that line of independence, but you're on that threshold. And so what we found was our folks here in America, the group average was right around that number. So they were living in home by definition. We picked them to be people living by themselves in their 80s and not in a living room. But they didn't have any bandwidth. So if they got a cold or they had anything pop up where they lost a little bit of fitness, they were going to drop below that line and would probably have to go to some sort of assisted living situation. The folks in Stockholm, the cross country skiers, the group average was most closer to like 35 to 38 milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now that number is about the Vio to Max you would find for a normal college mail. And so these folks that were literally 80 or 90, if the you know the joke, if a Saber to Tiger ran in the room or whatever and it chased it down. And we all had to run at this year who didn't get eaten alive, the college men would probably have gotten eaten before the 90 year olds. In one case we had a 92 year old individual and I think his Vio to Max was 38 which was an our estimation world record, the highest Vio to Max for somebody over the age of 90. I'm asking what is the typical resting heart rate for somebody very fit like these older Swedish cross country skiers that you have somebody has a this let's say their number is 35 milliliters per kilogram in this Vio to Max test. But since most of us don't have access to that kind of equipment, but we can measure our pulse rate. What was a typical resting heart rate resting pulse rate? Sub 60. Yeah, I mean, typically that's a good number to go off of for anybody regardless of age. Anytime I see somebody above that I'm going to start asking questions certainly above you know you'll see in the literature people will say 60 to 80 is normal and I don't agree that at all. If you're up if you're resting heart rate is 75 weeks for a minute. There's either something going on or you're not fit. How much cross country skiing were they doing on average in the previous let's say if we take the previous 20 years since they'd been long time cross country skiers divide that by 20 years. Yeah, on average are these people cross country skiing five hours a day two hours a day and I were a day. Yeah, that's actually a good question. I don't remember it's been many years, but they were not doing it every single day and that the volume would not have shocked you. It was the consistency over 50 years that got them there. Now obviously these people were again world champions and Olympic gold medalists in 1940s and 50s. So they were elite they just continued consistently over time, but it wasn't a shocking amount of physical fitness. They also didn't go out either way to train hard. They were busy chopping wood, they were busy doing number of other things and then they just happened to do some of these races and ski along way. But it wasn't a crazy amount to where you're like, oh, that's great, but I could never hit that number. It was something much more reasonable. So it's to take away to be consistent about getting cardiovascular exercise and we can define what consistent means in terms of days per week a little bit later. And I know we will. What are some other examples? I love these examples of from the real world. Here's the downside though. So I only told you about their VO2 Max. What I didn't tell you about is their like strength and functionality. And that part was no more superior than it was their counterparts who were not exerciseers. So what that showed really, really clearly and many other studies have been done since then that look at the classical we call life long endurance exercises. We'll see in general their VO2 Max, their cardiovascular function, their resting heart rate, their blood pressure. It will be markedly healthier than folks who don't exercise. It is extraordinarily clear that type of exercise is very important for chronic disease management. No doubt about it. However, it is not sufficient for overall global health because it does almost nothing for leg strength. For any other marker of health which we can talk about what are the things that are actually going to predict mortality more debated than most. So that was a big, a big smashing indication that's like, hey, this is great. However, you're leaving things on the table for your overall health. Now one could argue they're 80 and they're doing pretty well. But they weren't doing as well in these areas. And so a study we did later actually as a follow up was looking at Montezagas twins. So this is actually interesting being a scientist. This is a classic example of one of my graduate students who had been in my lab for probably three or four years. And she was in our single fiber physiology lab and she's, you imagine she's isolating individual muscle fibers from an athlete, one by one with the tweezers. And she's going to do several thousand individual cells. So she's you're down there for hours and things happen down there. You kind of lose your mind. And she was just kind of going on one day with one of my colleagues just talking and she's like, oh yeah, my uncle is really, really fit and something or other. And then oh yeah, he's a twin. And he was like, oh, Zimano's like, I guess, and she's like, yeah. For those that don't know Montezagas are identical twin. Yeah, what's interesting. So you basically have what I'm setting up here is this is the perfect exercise scientific experiment. Montezagas identical twins mean they have the exact same DNA. So an egg was fertilized split and then two humans grew out of that with the exact same DNA. And so now we can start answering the question of, well, yeah, okay, what about maybe these cross country skiers, maybe they were just genetic freaks. Maybe it didn't matter. It's like some people have, well, genetics are always a component to it. But how much? Well, now we have a scenario lining up where it's like, wait a minute, you have Montezagas twins. So we have a replica of a human being exact same DNA. The only difference is that we would see in their physiology now would be due to lifestyle circumstances. Interesting. So Montezagas twin, it's identical, right? Huh? Great. Do they exercise? Well, one of them does. He's a lifelong endurance exercise runner cycle is swimmer iron man, all these things. What about the other one? Nope. He doesn't exercise at all. And at that point, like, I wanted to kill my graduate student because I'm like, you've been in my lab for three years. Or more probably, and you've never told me that in your household is the perfect scientific experiment for exercise, you could ever create. And like Jesus, that they've looked on her face when I call it an eye for staring at her. She's just like, oh my god. So I'm like, call them right now. They're coming in the lab and fly them in from Chicago. I don't care what we have to do like we're getting them in. And so I wanted to actually going back to the model that was first developed by the Harvard for T.G. that. One thing that's interesting about that committee is they started off with the concept of trying to examine human performance through a holistic lens. And so it was the antithesis of looking at either organ by organ. So we're going to only look at the cardiovascular system or only going to look at skeletal muscle. And then we're saying we're looking at this entire picture. And so that model we wanted to carry through when these twins and I said, all right, I want to bring them in the lab. But I'm not just going to look at one system. I want to do everything. So we took stool samples, we took blood, we did vertical jump test, we did maximum strength test, we did MRIs of muscle mass, we did. And then we did a real two max test, we did efficiency stuff, we did, did I testing, we did an IQ test, we did psychological battery, we wanted to look at everything to figure out all of these things, what differ between the twins and if so, the second key question there is, by how much. So can I improve my view to max? Sure, everyone knows that, but how much can it change by 5%. 80%. Like where is the number? And so putting some quantification on this was very important. Again, we had another example of a classic endurance only training paradigm compared to a non. Actually, this is a person who's in a truck driver by vocation, which is, and I actually drove for a potato chip company, which was even funnier. The endurance act that it actually was great because like any endurance people, he had a, he had physical books of all of his training mileage for the last 35 years. And we could, we just went through them, we calculated the total amount of miles he ran, his averages, his heart rates per time. We had this unbelievable thing like what races he was in, he had the documentation, he was just totally nuts, right? Like something that endurance people are like shaking their head right now going, oh yeah, I got that too. And endurance folks are pretty nerdy. Yeah, super nerdy, right? So it was great because now we could validate as close as one could to actually how much he ran and things like that. They had about a 35 year discord. They both exercised up through high school, about a teen they stopped doing it by the time they write them in the lab there in their mid 50s. So it was about 35 years in difference. And when we ran them through the testing, if you look at the, the measures that were similar to the Sweden study, it was almost identical. The, the exercising twin was significantly better at things like a lipid panel resting heart rate blood pressure, view two max. Any of those markers as predicted were much better. What was very interesting though was things that were in the middle. First of all, their total amount of miles was almost identical, like to the gram. Within the margin of error of a dexascant could possibly ever be the non-exercise or though was a little bit fatter. So the difference in actual body weight was explained almost entirely by body fat or non-lean tissue really same story to it. So okay, like no one surprised there that the exercise was a little bit leaner even though it didn't change the old amount of muscle mass at all. When we looked at some of the more functional tests and we looked at things like muscle quality. So this is a metric you can get from an ultrasound. You can kind of think about this as how much fat is inside the tissue, which is sometimes an advantage for endurance athlete to have a little bit more of what are called intermuscular direct wasrized because it's a fuel directly in the tissue. But in general, the muscle quality was not in favor of the exercise. If you looked at the performance testing and if you looked at strength, it favored the non-exerciser. So now again we have the same finding we saw in our Sweden study but in identical twins. So it really, really highlighted the fact that if you want to move forward with optimal health, simply picking one silo is not going to get you there. What's all of meaning? Just running, just cycling. Does this mean that the twin that did not exercise could jump higher or win an arm wrestling competition? Not that that's a vital thing to be able to do, but just in terms of measuring strength, you know, it's our isometric strength. Was the non-exercising twin stronger, at least as strong as their exercising. Yeah, it's particularly in grip strength. Yeah, and any of the measures like the vertical jump, like extension power and a number of things, they often favored the non-exerciser. Which you're still a little bit of a chicken egg, you don't know of necessarily the endurance training reduced that other twins strength or it doesn't even really matter, per se. I think the highlight of it is, can you change some of these metrics of the ultimax? Yeah, not even close. These things are very responsive, regardless of your genetics, your genetics will give you a starting place very clearly. Even the non-exerciser was a pretty healthy guy. So they were in a good spot, mid-50s doesn't exercise, doesn't really pay attention to his diet at all. And he was in a pretty good shape. However, if you want to actually move progress and move for high functionality, you have to do something besides just run by just distance run. Now, I could say the same thing for strength training. That alone, because I don't want to make this thing like I'm saying endurance exercises, it worked. And both case, both these studies, those folks were much better off in metrics that are incredibly important to mortality, how long you're going to live, how long you're going to live, feel to max, etc. It's just not going to get there in terms of strength. We took a look at muscle fiber physiology as well, which is very interesting. So what I mean is, there's generally two types of muscle fibers. Fast twitch and slow twitch. And one of the things that is a hallmark of aging is a reflective reduction in fast twitch fibers. And that's because it's difficult to activate them unless you're doing high force activities. You're going to activate slow twitch fibers doing almost any activity of daily living. And so they stay around fast twitch fibers unless you're doing something of high force or going not be used and they're not going to be kept around. And that's a problem because when you look at things like the need for like strength through aging, the ability to catch yourself from a fall. These things are incredibly important. If you don't have fast twitch fibers, you don't have the speed to get your foot out in front of you on time and you don't have the eccentric strength to stop the fall from happening. And so if you look across again, the aging literature, they're very clear about the importance of maintaining strength and fast twitch fibers over time. So we know that this is an important distinction here, overall. And people will often talk about, okay, how much of that is genetically determined. Can I change my fiber type? And the answer there is is resoundingly yes. And can I change it with exercise? And the answer is absolutely you can. And then next question is how much? So now again, we're going to see an order of magnitude in general without going too far down an area that maybe we could say for it for later. Each one of your muscles in your body has a different percentage of fast twitch in slow twitch. For example, your calf. If you look at your soleus, which is kind of the smaller one that goes in the back, that's generally mostly slow twitch. Typically 80% or so slow twitch. The gastroach, which is the other one right next to it. So if you're to point your toe next to your face and that part that kind of flexes out in the middle pops out. That's your gastroach. That is almost the inverse. So it's generally 80% fast twitch, maybe 20% slow twitch. Generally anything anti-postural or a postural rather anti-gravity. Spinal directors, things that are meant to keep you up or moving all day are going to be slow twitch and things like your hamstrings, which are for explosion or going to be fast twitch. Well, we biopsy the quad in these individuals. And in that muscle, it's generally about 50-50 fast twitch slow twitch as a really broad number. Well, one of the things that we found was in the non-electricizer. It was almost textbook what you had predict. It was about 50% or so slow twitch, a little bit of percentage of fast twitch, and then about 20% of what are these called hybrid fibers, which are a hallmark of activity. In the exercise, it was about 95% slow twitch. And so it's extremely clear, again, I don't know if maybe their set point was a little bit higher towards that and the non-electricizer devolve down to his place or the other one. But it doesn't matter. I mean, you're going from 40% slow twitch in one case to 95% slow twitch in another case. It shows you that the limits of physiological adaptation are darn near boundless, given enough exposure. And in this case, 35 years of extremely consistent training, and his muscle morphology was completely different than his identical twin with the exact same DNA. Those are two beautiful examples of people doing endurance work for a number of years, and what that gives them in terms of benefits and functionality. Has the opposite experiment been done or observed where somebody just weight lifted or just sprinted for a number of years? I don't know that there's identical twin control. That's a little bit too third twin. Too much chasper, right? Triplets. Okay, so triplets out there. If you're exercising in different ways, or people who have triplets, maybe you assign one kid to be a runner, one to be a weight lifter and the other one to be set into, please don't do experiments like that. But the expectation as I understand it would be that the person that sprints or that does have a squats, explosive work would then have more fast twitch muscle fibers in their quad, and they're non exercising counterpart would have fewer that would make sense. But what happens if you assess the endurance level in somebody who's just done strength training or just sprinted? Yep, so we don't have those data specifically. We're actually just starting to have studies come out on life long strength trainers. And there's actually a very good reason for this, which is a whole story we can get into. But the quick answer is we don't have a lot of people who've been lifting weights for 30 or plus years. We have a whole swath of people who've been doing endurance training for that long. Is that because fewer people have been weight training or weight trainers all dead? You go back to the 1953, 1954. You had two major things happen that change the entire course of exercise physiology and exercise science and really exercises we know it. It's important to understand the history of our field. A lot of the questions I get are based on false assumptions of what exercise can and can't do. As an example, we questions like momentum. Should I use momentum or that's cheating, right? Or it doesn't work. It compromises my results. It's actually totally untrue. There are excellent reasons when you should use momentum when you lift. There are reasons when you should not. It is sometimes very beneficial to go fast with the exercise repetitions, sometimes very slow and controlled as better. Any question I get in fact, I'm very infamous for always responding with it depends. The reason I say it depends is it depends on the goal when you're training for speed or power or muscular endurance. The answer to some of these very common question differs. What people fail to realize is they think they're asking the right question because they don't understand this history. What's been planted in your brain subconsciously is driving that question. It's not necessarily the right one. So if we walk through that a little bit, you'll see what that field has led you. Why you think certain things matter when they actually don't? Or maybe your assumptions are incorrect. And then exactly what to do about that. I'd like to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic and adaptogen drink. Designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012. So I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast. Reason I started taking Athletic Greens in the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it helps me meet all of my foundational nutritional needs. That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals, and the probiotics are especially important to me. Athletic Greens also contains adaptogens which are critical for recovering from stress, from exercise, from work or just general life. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash human men to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens, go to athleticgreens.com slash human men to claim the special offer. So in 1953, 1954, you had Roger Bannister breaking the four minute mile, so subformin a file. And then you also had Sir Edmund Hillary and then his shirt but Norgue, some had Everest. And the same basically two years span. That exact same year after that was a formation of what's called the American College of Sports Medicine. Now that is still around today. It is a preaminent group for this exercise as medicine. So if you're interested in things like exercise for obesity prevention, for cancer treatment, for things like that, it's not really sports medicine. It's more for clinical exercise. That's the place to go. American College of Sports Medicine. So we have this launching of both a ton of people wanting to start doing endurance exercise and start swimming and cycling and running. And then you have a launch of people coming off of the back of the Harbor Fatigue Lab. So the Fatigue Lab actually shut down on 1947. So you have these people interested in physical fitness, but nowhere to go. Well, all those people left the Harbor Fatigue Lab and started their own labs and other places. So you've launched the careers of people like Dave Costell and John Halazzi and some of these very famous exercise physiologists. And they start building laboratories and we start for the first time ever studying the science of exercise. So years go by and these people happen. The 1960s and 1970s, what we call the runners-boams. So people start that if you in fact, if you look at the numbers of people who are doing marathon, it explodes through these two decades spans. Right? Because it's like them. We could do these endurance feeds. Notice both those feeds were endurance, right? Running short term as well as going over there. And then what has thought anything about strength training? And here's why. In the late 1880s, there was a very famous physician, a Georgia winch ship, I think was his name. Who was a big proponent of strength training? Well, he died in like in the age of 50 something of a heart attack. And that terrified people of strength training for 70 years because they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, that stuff will kill you. Because he was a doctor. He was trying to run around the country doing his exhibitions and reporting it and then he died. It's sort of like atkins. 100% dying. Some people say he died of a heart attack. Other people said he fell through the ice into cold water that's debated. But the fact that a heavy proponent of a given nutrition plan dies suddenly. Yep. Not good for business. So now the little storm is brewing. 1940s, and I'm going back a little bit, but bear with me for a second. There's a guy named Peter Carberbich and he's a scientist out of Springfield, like the decorative physical education pe. Like that's a legendary place for wringle college. And he is anti-strength training for a lot of the same reasons. And his entire career talked about note to this. He's the one that launched these ideas at strength training. We'll make you lose flexibility. It will be bad for kids. And like all these things that we know now are clearly not true. He's proponent of these things. And there's a show that happened in his Springfield College. And guy named Bob York, and if you work Bobbel, that's still around today. He's going around the country and putting on these exhibitions. They come to Springfield. And it's sort of like a new age, like social media thing, where it's like the students know what's about to happen. Because Carberbich shows up to this event. And everyone knows he hates strength training. And everyone is like waiting for it to end just to see what he's going to say. And the whole exhibition goes on. These people are doing, you've got to roll back in the time like body building, weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman. It's like all the same thing. There's no differentiation yet. And it finishes and Carberbich stands up and the crowd goes silent. And he just asks one question. And he just points to one of the guys and says scratch your back. And now he's just assuming and waiting for the guy to be like, Ah, and not be able to put his hand behind his head. And I think he pointed to John Gimm at Couset, like a famous bodybuilder. And he reached back and scratched his back, no problem. And then they proceeded to grab two dumbbells. I think there are 50 pound dumbbells and do a back flip standing back flip with both in the chant. They start doing the splits on stage and they start going, performing all kinds of physical function. Test and Carberbich's stunned. He's like, holy shit, he has nothing to say. He leaves there in his whole life has changed. All these things he was claiming were shown in his face to be false. He does a one 80 on his career. He starts running study after study on strength training and starts finding immediately. There are no determinants to strength training in terms of like global health, right? Of course, you can do it wrong and things like that. In fact, here comes a whole bunch of benefits. So through the 1950s, while this thing's going on with the endurance folks, no one's still strength training. Because there's no record to see. There's no American college sports medicine. There's no societies. There's no science. We're not sure it's safe. And meanwhile, Carberbich is just hammering study after study after study, showing you it's safe. It's safe. It's safe. But it hasn't picked up yet. And then everything changed in 1977. Thank you Arnold Schwarzenegger. He came out with the trifle. He hits you with pumping iron, which I know you know that movie, right? Pumping iron. Interesting movie. Even for those not interested in bodybuilding. It's a very interesting movie because it really gives a window into not just him. But the way in which weight training started to show up as a regular practice. You know, when I was growing up, the only people who weight trained were people preparing for football. Bodybuilders who basically didn't exist in the town where I grew up. And the only people who did yoga were like, Yogi's doing bickrum. But now you drive through any major American city or your Piancidi and their yoga studios. There's Jims with free weights. Arnold Schwarzenegger is largely responsible. I think for initiating that shift. Yep. He gets he think about it. He hit us with pumping iron, cone and and then the terminator. Almost in back to back like very close within years. So you've got this whole cascade of the 70s of people running cycling and swimming. Now science has started to come out that it's not dangerous and maybe actually some benefit and then bone. Not only is it not bad for you. It can make you into a real world superhero. I mean, think about the psychology of a child growing up watching somebody like Conan. Think about what Batman looked like in the 1950s and 60s. Right? And then bone. I can look like that. Now not everyone wants to look like Arnold. But you see the power that can land in people. No one had ever seen or thought you can make your body transformed like that. You could baby born like that. But no chance. That's within the grass of all of you. When I was a kid growing up one of my favorite books was the Guinness Book of World Records. Yeah. I still have images in my mind of the the coldest and the the longest life span. And there was a picture in there of Arnold Schwarzenegger. And you know what his record was. It's had perfectly developed man. Yeah. Which is as you point out that isn't the physique that most people aspire to. But it really I did inspire this. The shift. The other thing about resistance training that I think. Has a certain allure for some people. Men and women. Is that it's one of the few forms of exercise that because of the enhanced blood flow to the muscle that occurs during the training. The so called pump. It gives you a transient but somewhat real window into what your results will be. You know when you run and you're gasping for air. You don't get this you aren't experiencing what it's like to be faster than you are that day. That's correct. But when you wait train you get an aesthetic picture into how your functionality and aesthetic will change. It disappears a few hours later. Sure. As the so called pumps of subsides. But it's a very interesting form of exercise in that way. It's almost as if you go into learn a language and during the process of learning for brief moments you're actually fluent. And then it gets taken away. Yeah. So it puts the dopamine carrot out in front of you. Yeah. This is just me hypothesizing as to why weight training might have taken off the way that it is. Yeah. And it's like if you got paid every hour on the hour when you're working. And then at the end of the day like they take the money back. But you still like as the time clock is going on in your day. Looking up and you're just seeing why you're watching your bank account grow in real life. Like you can see why it's so addicting to those folks. So to finish the story here, going back to your actual question to answer it. This is happening in the late 70s or late 80s. And so now Joe Weater, all these gyms, they're exploding because people want to look like that. Or if they have they realize they have a chance to change how they physically look. That had never been a reality before. You can just be men at that point. You're almost exclusively. Yep. For a large number of reasons cultural acceptance, etc. Even with endurance stuff, you could get fitter and run faster and that's better. But it wasn't going to change how you looked unless you were losing fat. Now you can change how you look which is so incredibly decking factors of a very famous quote. I think it was actually Joe Weater who said, show me one man who wants to be strong and I'll show you 10 who want to look strong. Right. It's like that's very, very powerful. There's this whole, like, there's tons of this history I can go into which is sort of explaining to you. But now you're now you're in the mid 80s and you have what I call my generation. So you have my generation who fall in love with strength training the 18 in the 1980s and 90s. But there's really no scientific field for it. It's not really come about yet. The science of endurance and exercise physiology is now homing along and massive rate because these people came up in the 70s and 80s and they're five, 10, 15 years in their career they're producing their engineering graduate students, they're starting their own labs and exercise physiology still to this day is 80% endurance steady state stuff almost exclusively. Well now my generation you love, you love sports, you love lifting you all of all these things and now we see happen is the Chicago bulls. Michael Jordan starts picking up strength training. That's on TV, he's on sports center and then mid 1990s lifting weights and we go back actually to the late 1970s and I'm not sure if you're football fan. But any football family will recognize the Nebraska corn huskers in the 1970s and 80s change how football's played. Well the reason is because they started strength training and they started doing it with the guy named Boyd Epley who's the founder of the NSCA. So the national strength, the conditioning association is formed in the late 1970s as well. So just like ACSM was developed the year after those two events happened, 1978 the year after Arnold comes out, boom, NSCA is formed and now you have a scientific organization dedicated to strength and conditioning. You've got NFL strength conditioning coaches that are starting to come on board, you've got scientists that are starting to come in the labs and strength conditioning becomes a scientific field. Everything swings now from an exercise perspective into bodybuilding. And so almost all of the things in fact we were sort of talking before I could run a whole bunch of tricks on you. And I could ask you a whole bunch of questions about things that you think are absolute standards or guarantees about training. I'm supposed to do this, I'm never supposed to do that for instance. For instance is it okay to train a muscle group on back to back days? Most people are at home thinking no you're not supposed to train a muscle group. And that's total nonsense, right? Other things like body parts split training, right? Train one muscle group per day. Other things like cardio, endurance training, influencing will ruin my gains from my left. All of these things are on at a base of assumptions that come from bodybuilding. Now that's a fantastic world but because everything started in the late 1970s as bodybuilding in terms of basic strength training was that weightlifting and power lifting were not at all around, right? They were but nobody cared again show me someone who wants to be strong, I'll show you 10 who want to look strong. The physique thing just dominated and we're not getting out of that yet. We're not out of it, we're starting to though because here's why people started to realize this this bodybuilding thing is fantastic. I can change my physique, I'm getting better. But damn, these workouts take an hour and a half, two hours. And I'm going to spend that whole time on one or two body parts, which means I'm going to have to lift six days a week. And I'm going to have to do that consistently, right? Now I'll send boom, two hours on my elbow flexors. Damn, my elbow started to hurt. And yet my understanding is that it doesn't really require two hours a day. Not at all. Training in order to get benefits even just for hypertrophy. Totally. But a lot of the times you're going to have to get some amount of time in because you're spending so much isolation. So we've gone away from training movement running as a movement, cycling as a movement. Training my biceps is a muscle, our muscle group training my hamstrings are a muscle group. That's not a human movement. So we've done a 180 in terms of selecting the exercises from movement based prescription. To now muscle group based training. So when you're isolating muscle groups, that means a whole chunk of your body is really not doing much throughout the day. So what happens if you're doing say legs on Monday and you miss Monday, because you're on a flight. Now your legs have to wait a whole, another week, right? That's the social depot. So this has to become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing, I actually don't feel that great. I'm not super fit. I'm sweating, just walking up the stairs. I'm out of breath. Why? Because all that training you've done nothing for your cardiovascular fitness. You've done nothing to improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood flow. And so that paradigm swing way too hard into the exercising, especially lifting weights, is single joint, often machine, often slow, often high volume, isolation. And that left a giant opening of people going away to minute. What if you could get in the gym? I could promise you the same or better results in under 30 minutes. And in fact, you also feel better. You'll lose more weight. And that opened up group exercise classes. Kettlebell stuff, crossfit type of stuff, circuit training. Because you can come in. You won't get so beat up because of volume slower. The time is much lower. You get multiple adaptations at the same time. Great. The problem with that though, Fast Forward 10 years, is it started burying people because you've now deemphasized movement quality and you've overemphasized scores. So this is a classic example. If you go and you watch pumping iron, you'll see or anybody go there. You'll see if they're doing a bicep group. They don't even really pay attention to the rep range. They don't really pay attention to the load. They're looking at their muscle. They're trying to figure out how do I get that thing to fire. They're squeezing their flexing, they're posing at the end of every set. They're trying to figure out, am I getting enough pump? It is exclusively founded on exercise quality. The rep range, the numbers almost irrelevant. When you go to the other model, exercise technique, it doesn't matter. Just get the most amount of weight up or the amount of reps or the fastest time, etc. It should be processed. I've walked past some crossfit. So you as I've done two crossfit classes. I don't want to use that's crossfit I didn't. Oh, I enjoyed them. I definitely felt like I was working hard. I observed a lot of people in very close proximity. Doing Olympic lifts and doing kipping. That's where you kick your legs, folks. You know, sort of like bucking and kipping type pull ups. No, I enjoyed it. It wasn't for me for the long term. But it did seem that there was a lot of ballistic movement in close proximity to other people. So the hazard to me seemed more about that than the actual movement. Well, again, the point I'm setting up here is that was actually a really brilliant solution. For a lot of the problems, the classic body building, high-perch feet introduced. So it got away from isolation movements and got people doing big movements, which are more effective, generally better. Got people doing things fast and explosive. That's more athletic that is more important for longevity. It solves a lot of the problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. The issue they went with is they just pushed the pace on score rather than quality. They pushed the pace on how many people can be in here at the same time. So now you're doing higher risk movements, higher intensity, higher fatigue, and with a tool, not that they don't care about technique, but it's not the thing that they're most concerned about. It's getting the number and the thing done. They solve the time issue, though, you can get tremendous results in three days a week, under 45 minutes, each session, etc. Burn people out though, wage them a high intensity, wage them often, and the other problems. Safety concerns, all kinds of orthopedic issues and other stuff. Can I interrupt you for a moment and just ask a question as we go through this arc of the history of why endurance training predominate or strength training or bodybuilding type training or crossfit type training, because I think this is fascinating. I know we're about to arrive at where we are today and what the future looks like for people and what they should focus on and do. At what point, if any, do you think resistance training started to become adopted by women? There was no equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger. There was Linda Hamilton and the Terminator. There are some impressive physics, certainly on female actresses and athletes, the William sisters, very impressive musculature and physics, and of course, their tennis planks, for itself. Has that happened yet? What I mean is, do you think since you work with both men and women, do you think that most women understand that weight training done properly is going to be extremely beneficial for them? Maybe even especially for them in terms of offsetting bone density loss and things of that sort, or we still waiting for the popular stimulus for getting 80% of young women thinking I want to lift weights. Yeah, heart for me to answer because I'm not a woman, right? Now I have a daughter, she's four, so we'll see. What I can say is I've probably worked with, I don't know how many professionals I have in total, a lot. I've worked with them probably 14 professional sports, I've worked with five young winners, MVP's, like the whole, all the credentials, right? I bet 35, 40% of the athletes have worked with our female. So I've worked with Olympic gold medalists, I've worked with bronze medalists and multiple sports, I've worked with the most decorated power lifter of all time. So in a number of these areas, fighters, world championship, all these things. For me, I feel like that burst is already happened. My students, if you look at my classroom, I don't know what the numbers are, but there is no small amount of time. But there is no small number of females in exercise science and exercise physiology. If you look at our laboratories, that's one thing you will see. There are very few female exercise sciences. There are very few female strength and conditioning coaches, but that number is coming down at a astronomical rate. You have people that are being hired in every sport. You pick the NFL, you pick Major League Baseball. Every few months we're hearing first female hired for this, first female hired for that. The Yankees Rachel, Rachel Beck, it's fantastic. You know, Rachel's been out to my lab. She's terrific. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's she's fantastic. I mean, she's now being hired as I think she's a hitting coach now. Actual sports coach. She's going to be a jam. Right, that's as her goal. She's a terminator. So that's already happening. And my students that are coming through our program are getting placed in these roles. They haven't gotten through yet a lot in terms of being an actual scientist. But they're getting there. Sports scientists in the NBA bring hired females in terms of big data collected. Sports science and tech will cover, you know, and another discussion. But I think it's happening whether or not the cultural and social prep. I can't speak to that and the equation. What I can speak to though is one of the things I think is is most fun coming forward scientifically is, you know, a number of years ago and I came back, came through with their mandates. So I think it's no longer acceptable to exclude women from science of a research, right? Because we just did that for decades. Well, what happened, I just feel this in because I think it's worth noting is that for many years, studies even on rodents. Yeah. We're mainly carried out on male rodents because the assumption and the assumption turned out to be wrong. But the assumption was that the physiology of female rodents because they don't have a menstrual cycle. It's not 28 days. They have an extra cycle. It's four days. A different type of cycle that that would somehow disrupt the data. Turns out that's entirely wrong. Now it's actually required. When you sit on a grant study panel, which are the people evaluate grants, you they ask. They literally say, did they meet the criteria for sex as a biological variable? Here we're not talking about sex as the verb or the human sex. Yeah. Biological sex. And if you don't say, yes, that's a strong hit against the grant. And if you say, yes, then it checks off that box. So it's now required to both male and female rodents and humans be studied in a given study. Unless the study is specifically geared toward understanding that only exists in one, one or the other population. We're not such as menopause for instance. Yeah. Menstrual cycle. Andropares. For instance. Yeah. But this is extremely important. I'm excited to hear that. So where I was going to go with that is actually. So that was step one, which is cool. You got to include. Where we haven't gotten to yet, but I've seen more and more grant applications come through for this. It's just the funding hasn't hit yet, which is it's one thing to end the let women be in the same studies. That's great. It's another thing though to start performing high performance research, specifically for female questions. That has not happened yet. And that's just like a funding issue, right? We haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. We don't get a lot of financial support for sports science. But we can't track down the money yet of something going, I mean, going, I want to do a study in female athletes. So I answer female athlete questions. These won't help men. These are questions specific to the female. That's the next step, right? That's where we got to get to. So we can say maybe we should do things differently around training, recovery or or we shouldn't or doesn't matter. There's there's some there's a handful of. Not lower quality, but like some studies. I don't love them yet. There's just needs to be a ton of work. Birth control is a very good example. Right? The the information for women at female athletes or even just like hard exercises. You don't have to be competitive athlete around what is birth control doing, what types, how should I manage that, what conversations should I be having with my doctor. Almost nothing like women have nothing to go on for high performance stuff. So what if I'm trying to compete in an event or run a race, how like all those types of questions should be answered. Normal value, normal data, performance testing, like it's just not there on the female. So that's an area I think like if somebody really wanted to make a change, that the science is want to do it. I know I talked to so many in our field that would really love to explore it. Because it's getting there. The like I said, the coaching side is getting there. They're seeing that they're hiring these people. I'm seeing it in my students. You know, my following is not all men. Like it's a very large percentage of females and all I do is post about. Exercise science and like this is all I do. So well, this podcast is very we know very clearly the audience is 50% women, 50% men. That's right. Which is great. So just to jump back on our history discussion and to finish that point of where we're at now and where I think we're going to go. Should go. So we're walk through the body building kind of running everything and people walking into a gym. Anytime they lift weights, they're making all their choices based in the assumption that maximizing muscle size is. The goal and clearly that's not the case. There are other adaptations you may be after. So we talked about how that had problems. Then we talked about how some of these other forms of exercise filled those gaps. And then what problems those things introduce. Well, I think we're actually at a point where that pendulum is kind of slowly shifting into the middle. What I mean by that is if you want to maximize muscle strength, we look towards the power lifting community. If you want to maximize muscle power, we're going to look the weightlifting community. If you want to look for muscular endurance, well, Roundness, maybe we look into the cross fate communities and some of these obstacle course races or functionality things. So what we can do now is generate protocols that get us the exact adaptations we want and not ones we don't want. Because we can look back at each of these different styles of training and pick and choose. Optimal protocols are combinations for them. So somebody simply wants to get healthy. Like we talked about when we listed the nine adaptations and I mentioned health wasn't one of them. That's because what determines your health versus what determines my optimal health differs. So if I need more hypertrophy, I can look towards bodybuilding concepts. But if I have enough or maybe for personal reasons, I decide I have too much or I don't want to add any more. Then I can say, hey, how can I get stronger without getting bigger and bow in my look towards power lifting concepts? How can I get more powerful? How can I get faster? But I don't, you know, again, want to lose fat. Okay, great. Or if I want physique changes. So we have all these different areas we can pick and choose from. That have expertise in specific adaptations and develop ourselves. Perfect protocols based on that information. I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker. Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your media and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera. But you don't know what to do with that information. Inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course. But then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can visit inside tracker.com slash human to get 20% off any of inside tracker's plans. Again, that's inside tracker.com slash human to get 20% off. So with the understanding in mind as to how we all myself included arrived at such lopsided fitness, too much endurance, not enough strength, too much strength, not enough endurance. That's really hard to imagine. Anyone's perfect in this regard. Can you walk us through the nine different adaptations that you mentioned earlier and give us a way to assess our level of ability or our level of adaptation in each of those nine? Alright, the very first one we want to talk about is movement skill. Now, set aside support, specific, so I'm not going to give you an assessment for optimal golf technique swing. Is this really about human movements that you stay injury free and you can continue to train for as long as possible? So what are the minimum requirements? Now, if you can have access to a highly qualified physical therapist or movement specialist, that's the best route. Right, go to them, have them identify all of your movement patterns overhead, pressing, squatting, running all these things. That's your gold standard. If you want to do it yourself though, here's a very simple four step solution. So the way that I teach is I go joint by joint. And so I think this is just as the major ones, your shoulder, your elbow, your low back, hip, knee, and ankle. Okay, now what you can do is do a representative movement for you. So if you bench a lot, use the band. If you do pull ups, use the pull up. If you squat to that, I would recommend doing an upper body press, an upper body pull, a lower body press, lower body pull. An example would be a pushup, a pull up or a bent row, a squat, and then a deadlift. That would be a very, very well rounded approach. What you're going to do is do that movement and I would record it for yourself and record it front of you and a side view. Probably do three, ten repetitions per angle. Okay, slow and controlled, you don't need to need body weight. What you want to do is move and you want to look for four key things at every joint. All right, so I can get imagine of doing a squat. I'm going to do a squat and I'm going to focus on just my ankle and I'm going to look for these four things at the ankle. And then I'm going to go back and watch my knee and look for these same four things at the knee to the hip, et cetera. All right, so what are these four things? Number one is you want to look for symmetry. So symmetry is front to back, left to right, and your right limb and your left limb. All right, and so what we want to look for are if they aren't moving perfectly, that's fine. But you want to see is one moving further ahead than the other one is one turning to the side ones not is one fidgeting and and twitching around differently. So you want to look just to check to see and make sure that they're stable. That's one. Number two, you want to look for stability. So key indicators here are things like if you if you can't control a squat, a controlled squat where your knees don't start shaking. Like that would be an instability issue. So can you do the movement slow? Can you pause at the bottom maybe three seconds, maybe five seconds or 10? You should have complete control of that movement and all of these joints. The hip sliding to one side when you stand up is one elbow closer to your body when you're benching and the other one's more flare now. These are the things I'm talking about, right? I'm not worried about what angle they should be at or not you're simply looking for asymmetries or instabilities. All right, so again, as you're pushing up does one elbow start flipping and twitching and going all over the place. The third one is what I call awareness. So there are a lot of movement technique issues that are simply people don't know. And so you'll watch them squat. I do this on my classes all the time. I'll have 100 kids out there squatting and you'll see some horrible squat technique. And then when you just tell them, hey, did you realize your heels were supposed to be on the ground at all times when you squat like, oh, okay. And they can correct it. It's not actually a movement flaw. It was just simply an awareness. I didn't know. And then I actually didn't realize that that was happening that position. So we want all of our joints to be going through a general full range of motion, which is number four. So the ankles during like a squat, your knees should be able to go as far over your toes possible while maintaining good position, your feet flat on the floor, your, you know, three points of contact, your whole foot foot and you're not compromising another joint. So that's all you're going to look for those four things. Symmetry, stability, awareness and range of motion through each joint, three movement. It sounds difficult and time consuming. It's really not. You can generally kind of clear these things in one or two repetitions in a couple of seconds. And what you're really going to look for, there's lots of scoring schemes. You can, you know, test the physical therapist who's sort of you. I just look for absolutely terrible. Like, can't do it at all. Miner flaw or pretty close to good. That that's really all I'm looking for. So my scoring system is zero one three zero is like you're not going to do this exercise because you're at a very high acute risk. You might get hurt on rep one tomorrow. Number one, like a score of one is like, there's a minor flaw here. We can probably do it, but we need to be cautious of load and volume. Another one is maybe it's perfect, maybe it's not, but go ahead and sort of do it on a reasonable protocol. You'll be fine. So that's generally what you would need to do is a cost free method of identifying good movement technique within any of the things that you would do. What about speed? I actually don't think this is one most people should test. If you're a high performance athlete, we can run a 40-hour dash or we can do some different things with a velocity transfer to a barbell. If you're a weight lifter or something from most people pure speed is really maximum velocity or acceleration or kind of the two ways we break it down. It's not just telling not that necessary to test. What about number three power, which I believe before you told me was speed times force? So the reason why I don't worry too much about speed is because you can infer a lot of it from a power test and a power test is easier to do as well as easier to train for for most people. So the cost free version here is a simple broad jump. So this is stand with normal position. Jump out as far in front of you, you should possibly can. I measured the distance between where you started and the back of your heel where it lands. A super basic number to look for there is your height. So you should be able to broad jump how tall you are. If you're five foot five, you should hit five foot five, six foot five, etc. It's not perfect. That's going to ratchet down a little bit about 15% for females. They just simply don't have the power in general. That men have and so you're going to want to bring that down a little bit. But that's a very crude number. If you were to look at like a high performance NFL player. If they're six feet tall, they're going to be jumping like nine to ten to eleven feet. If you can jump your body height. We're not looking for optimization in this particular test. What you are looking for red flags. If you can jump your body height, you're going to be just fine. That's incredibly straightforward and yet I have one question. Yeah, I'm assuming that I can squat down as low as I need to before I jump. I can swing my arms from back to front as. Harder with as much momentum as I can muster. And when I land, you said, I'm going to take the measure from where the back of my heels. I'm going to measure the distance you actually covered. So to clarify, there's no running approach here. There's no steps into it. You're going to stand at a still. Yeah, you can swing bounce as much as you'd like to do. You're going to project it all off. So you're going to measure the distance from the tip of your toe. So basically stand behind the line. And then the furthest point back. Or you land. So basically the worst possible score. Not the best possible. Because your feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going to be a little bit farther. And now technically, if you fall backwards and your hand touches the ground, we mark that number. But in this case, just use the for this point back of your back heel and go from there. I'll be drawing it tomorrow morning. Now, if you have access to a little bit more technology or you just really want to know a better number. A classic vertical jump is a good starting place. So you can actually do this in a simple, cost-free way. You can just measure two of your hands, put them together. So the both of your middle fingers are touching. Overlapped them and put them directly over your head. And then you can kind of reach up as high as you can get. And you mark that on the wall. My brother and I used to do this all the time. We would take a highlighter. They the yellow ones and color as much as we cut on our fingertips. Touch the wall so that the highlighter would stain the wall. If you actually go back to my house for my childhood, you'll see these markers all over our house. I'm sure parents were thrilled. My dad didn't care. He didn't care. This is like whatever you guys do to everyone. So you want to measure that. And then of course, you're going to jump with those two hands and touch as high as you can up. And you're going to measure the distance between your standing reach and the actual height that you jump there. Now, the reason you're doing it too handed by the way is because if you do one handed, you can actually reach pretty high by offsetting your shoulders. And now you're getting into differences of, you know, who has more shoulder mobility, who has ability to kind of get up there. A two foot stand or a two handed standard approach is there. Same thing, no running approach here. You can dip, you can drive, you can do all those things, you can swing your arms, but you're going to be a two handed touches is a general way to do that. And you want to look for a number of something like 24 inches or higher. If you're past the age of 50, that number can come down a little bit to closer to 20. And again, for females, it's going to be ratcheted down about 15%. Every year you go, if you're a middle aged female and you're jumping 20 inches, you're in a pretty good spot. You're going to be looking really nice there. So now, if you can do that on a forespelate, that's even better. So these are very basically scales that will go out to multiple digits, sometimes five to nine digits passes a row. And you're going to stand on these things, you do the exact same test. And these are very interesting because they'll tell you not only how high you jump, but they'll tell you how much force you put in the ground. They can also tell you how long it took you. This is called your rate of force development, as well as impulse and speed, and a bunch of other stuff, which are important to help you understand where on the power spectrum you need to be. So you would do that in addition to using some sort of velocity transducer on a barbell. So a very classic thing to do would be, let's say you're going to do a squat. And you're going to put this device on the barbell. And that's going to measure the speed of which the barbell moves. And you're going to do that at 40% of your one-word petition max, 50% 60% 708090 up to 100. And that allows you to create what's called a force velocity curve. And you can start to see at what point when you start loading things heavy, you start slowing down too much. And that'll tell you what part of the force velocity curve that you want to train to optimize your power. Why that's important? A lot of people will do things like what I'm training for power, how heavy should I lift? Well, the general answer people say is 30% of your one-word max. But that's actually not true at all. What's most optimal for power development, which we'll discuss more much later, is depending on where your flawed and the force velocity curve. So if you have access to technology like that, that can give you a lot more insight and information. If not, do the broad jump test or the highlighter on your fingertips and jump, it sets the wall test. At Andy Yelpens house. Hey, just, you know, it come along. There's already the walls are already messed up. Just go ahead and come up to the washing in and we'll do it. Fantastic. What about strength? Right. So strength is really important. You need to measure this in multiple areas and we'll start off with grip strength. Okay. So you can do this in two ways. You can buy a hand grip dynamometer. Now these are anywhere between $20 to $100. Anywhere. These are actually used to be, like when I was in school, like $100 a dollars. And now you can literally buy them on any website for $25 bucks. So my last recommendation is technically that's not cost-free. I know your whole thing about the cost-free protocols, but 25 bucks. I'm calling that basically cost-free. You can bring that in and test that. And that's just a little device where you're going to squeeze and you're going to do, and I would do your right hand and your left hand. You want to look for asymmetries there. But you want to look for something like, typically those are, they're going to give you a value in kilograms. And you want to look for something like a minimum score here of 40 kilograms. Ideally, you're up past 60 would be a really good spot to be in. You want to make sure that there's no less than 10% variation between your left and right hand. You're non-dominant hand actually shouldn't be that much weaker in this test. So what you'll actually see a lot of times is the non-dominant can be oftentimes stronger. Because the dominant hand is more for movement precision, writing, things like that. So you want them to be close. If you are a male and you are under 40 kilograms on a hand grip, to item a moment, we're going to need to train that. If you're a female, it's not that much lower, but about 35 kilograms is the cutoff point. If you're above 55, we can add a tree training, but I'm not worried about leaving it out of your training. If you're a female, if it's above 50, that's my sort of cutoff where we want to go. So that's a fairly cheap one. Another one that you can actually do is just a dead hang. So you can hold onto any bar, ideally one that is thin enough to where you can wrap your whole hand around it. So you don't want to be using a giant fat grip. You're going to have a false reading here. Something like going to the gym and jumping on any pull-up bar or pull-up rack. And you want to hang, and this is a simple time test. So in general, we should be able to hang for a minimum of 30 seconds as what we're looking for. 30 to kind of 50 seconds is my like good, but we could probably get better here. If you're cruising above 60 seconds, I'm generally pretty happy. This is actually a good example of when females tend to be better. The grip strength on women is tends to be strong and they can hang for quite a long time. So those standards don't really change that much for women. Now, if you are exceptionally large, this thing doesn't scale perfectly. If you're 240 pounds and even if you're lean, it's just hard. That's a hang and hold 240 pounds. Conversely, if you're 140 pounds, even if you're unhealthy, you're going to be able to hang for a long time. It's just not that much weight to carry. Just rough numbers to start off with. So that's grip strength. What about strength elsewhere in the body? The primary ones, you can do an upper body strength test. If you would like, although it's not technically something we do very often, happy to do it. Why don't I max bench press or something like that? That's great. The more one I'm generally more interested in is a leg extension test. And the reason I like this is a back squat is better. A barbell back squat is, look, that's my jam. That's my life, right? It's just very technically demanding. And it's challenging. You need spotters. You need comfort. A lot goes into this. So for the average person, a leg extension test is fairly standardized. You don't have to worry about technique and people can just get into it and go. And so what you want to look for there is a couple of standards you want to hit. Again, a very simple answer here is body weight. Can you do a leg extension with your body weight? How one repetition? One repetition. I can answer that right now. Can you? No. You can't? No. I can a hacksquat a reasonable amount of weight. But I was on the leg extension this morning and I was a nodalist machine and I certainly could not like you extension my body weight. Let me in the declare for. Were you doing a single leg? No. So by lighter, you can't like you central body weight. No, but I certainly can hamstring curl my body weight. Okay. So we may have some deficiencies in our quads that we need to go after. But that's a pretty good number you want to be at. If you go up an age past age 40 every decade, that can come down about 10%. And you'll still be in a pretty good slot. So if you're 50 years old and you're 170 pounds, if you can do 160, you're in a pretty good sort of spot. And then you could just again take it down about 10% every decade after 40. But prior to 40, there's really no change in strength. But certainly somebody in their 40s to 50s should be able to leg extension their body weight. No, did. I look forward to our discussion a bit later. Talk about how to build strength. Yeah. Any of these strengths, that's they don't have to be done to a technical true one Rettmax. You can use what are called repetition conversion equation. So put on a load that you think is kind of close to your maximum and just do it for as many reps as you can. As long as it's under five reps total, you can then actually go online and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere. And it will tell you, okay, you did three repetitions of 200 pounds. Your one Rettmax is probably 215. Whatever. So there's estimate equations. So if you don't want to spend the time or you're not truly comfortable, like, absolutely going to your true one Rettmax, just get to a number that's fairly close and do as many as you can. And then go online again, one Rettmax estimator equations are everywhere. If you get past five repetitions or so, the accuracy of those equations starts going down. So don't put on something and go on to 12 reps of it and then try to figure out your one Rettmax. It'll get close. You start moving past that. You're just getting worse and worse and worse accuracy. So I want to make sure whether you're doing the leg extension test or a front squat test. You don't technically have to do it. Absolutely. If neither of those are an option. Another one I like a lot here is simply a front squat or a goblet squat hold. So you're going to hold a weight in front of your chest, whether kettlebell is is great here at dumbbell is fine here. And you want to hold about half of your body weight. Go all the way to the bottom position and try to hold that for about 45 seconds. So it's it's a pretty good indicator of number one your position. It's hard to be in a bad position for that long at that load as well as core strength and low back stability. So it's a very different indicator than say the like a extension test, but it's a really nice one. So it doesn't require many moving parts. It's more difficult than leg extension, but it's quite a bit more functional and it's going to give you insight into a lot more areas than just the quadriceps. So 45 seconds down at the bottom of the squat and then returning to a standing position. Yep. And if you can't do the return. I actually I'm not that worried, but as long as you can hold that good position without a technical breakdown in that 45 seconds that's a really good spot. As an intro, I want a third of your body weight from 30 seconds. Terrific. I plan to attempt all of those strength tests very soon. What about hypertrophy? Sure. Actually before we get into that, I want to jump back really quickly. It's important to add a couple of caveats to the strength strength stuff. So there's two that I want to do. Number one. These are assuming you are technically proficient. So I don't want you to do any exercise to exhaustion or to maximum strength if you're not comfortable with your technique. So adjust these accordingly. If you're not comfortable with the front squat, do the leg extension. If you're not uncomfortable with that, do something different. So we never want to utilize maximum testing. If it's going to come with the consequence of serious acute injury. So that's the most important flag. The second one is your warm up protocol will have a huge effect on your actual results. So whenever you do these tests, especially if you're going to do a test, then I test again down the line. You want to make sure that that warm up protocol is standardized. Now again, the NSCA and I can give you resources has specific guides for exactly what to do for your warm up protocol prior to one of our max testing. So we can go there and you can look that stuff up. We can add that to show notes or something. Yeah, and I think when we get into a deeper discussion about strength and hypertrophy and resistance training in general, if we could touch into the best warm up protocol, I know I have mine and I'm certain it's going to be suboptimal based on everything. Maybe that's something. On every conversation we've ever had where I learned all the things I'm doing incorrectly, but I do make changes on the basis of what you tell me. It's not incorrectly so much as it is like suboptimal. That's a very kind way of telling me. It's incorrect. Thank you. What about hypertrophy? So the thing you want to pay attention to here is you have the aesthetic portion of hypertrophy. That's entirely up to you. There is no rationale. You can decide what you feel like looks good or doesn't look good. That's irrelevant. There is a sufficient amount you need to have where below that is detrimental to your health, regardless of your outcomes. The best way to do this is a couple of ways. Any sort of body composition test. It can do this. Whether this is a scan, there's like a dexus scan, which is a gold standard, or other ways of biological, biological impedance or other ways. There's a ton of different tests you can get that are pretty close. What you want to pay attention to when you get like dexus scan is a number called FFMI. That's a sense for fat free mass index. You can look at any number of online calculators. These are all standard. It doesn't matter where you pull them up. You don't have to worry about looking up and whatnot. It's right or not or something. That's going to tell you if you have sufficient muscle math. A number you want to look for in general something like if you're a man, your FFMI should be something like 20 or higher. If you're a woman, you want to look for something like 18. That's the targets. If you get past like 24 or 25 for a man, that's a lot of muscle mass assuming you're reasonably lean. Now if you're FFMI is like 24 or 25, but your body fat is like 40%. You're actually just a very very large individual. You're not in a great spot. So when we say these sort of numbers, it's the assumption that you're probably sub 30% body fat for a man and sub 35 for a woman. So those are the numbers. There are online calculators. All you really need to know is your total body weight. Your body fat percentage and then your height. You can answer those three numbers and then they'll tell you your FFMI score and it'll correct for an adjusted value. And most of those will actually tell you the grading rubric and then it's a good average bat, et cetera. But those are the numbers we look at. If you are as a man, sub 17, as a woman, sub 15, now we're in an area of pretty severe physiological detriment for insufficient muscle. And some of our later discussions will talk about why that matters. So that's not sub 17% body fat. That's specifically the FFMI. That's a correct. Yeah. What about muscular endurance? Is this where you're going to tell me I need to do well, so it's. So this is really nice. You can do any number of tests here. A standard plank is a good testament of Musken endurance. So can you hold a front plank for 60 seconds? Can you hold a side plank for 45 seconds? Pretty easy. If you're able to do a push up. So if you can't, that sort of tells you loan. It's actually interesting. If you can't do a single push up, that's not a muscular endurance issue. That's actually now a strength issue because that's a one-art max problem. So we want to be able to do for again for a general male. We should have no problem doing 25 plus consecutive push-ups. I apologize for interrupting you, but as long as we're talking about push-ups, you just mentioned form. Are we talking just touching the ground? Elbow is breaking right angles. What is a proper push-up according to your laboratory? Unless you have a very specific reason to limit range of motion, I want all my testing done three full joint range of motion. This is different for the person. So it's individualized to them. But in general for a push-up, this would be a full complete lockout of the elbows on the top, and a full chest touch or close to it at the ground. You can do it different. It doesn't really matter, but just keep it standard from your pre-test, your post-test, if you're trying to mark progress. But for us, unless we have a very specific reason, we're going full range of motion for all of these tests. So 25 push-ups from male. 25 push-ups for a male is a standard. And even something like 10 is a number we're looking for again, it's minimum categories for an upper body muscular endurance. And not to get two down in the weeds, but I have observed other people, of course, never myself. No, I'm kidding. But other people are pausing it, maybe at repetition 15, catching their breath, and then continuing, or you, that would be a test. That would be a piston. That would be a failed test. So no pauses. Correct. Just up down, up down, trying to hit at least 10, but ideally 25. I learned this lesson in one of our studies probably nine years ago, where we didn't clarify that. And so we actually had an individual. He wasn't, he wasn't being nefarious. He just figured out if I do a couple, take a quick break and do a couple. He, like, quadrupled his post-test result from his pre-test result, because he figured out that little hack. There. So you want to standardize it. It's not that I'm against or I have some sort of strong belief. Just trying to keep protocol standardized, which means any break failed test. So 10 to 25 pushups minimum for males. Yeah, for females. So also, if it's sub 10 for a man, that's again, and you're like, very severe red flag problem. We really, really like to see a number above 25. Okay, that's where we're anchoring. Anything between 10 and 25 is like, yeah, but not severe. It means they have work to do. We have work to do. And for females. For a female, you're going to scale that sort of back. So a female, the answer could be as little as zero. Right. So you're going to see that. Can you do a full position? If they're in that position, we're generally not going to do a Musker and Dres test from the knees. We already know the answer is your zero. We'll actually default to another test, which I'll talk about in a second here. So for those, those folks, anything that's going to scale down a little bit. Right. So basically, you're looking at 15 is that marker, like 25 was for the male. Where I want to see above 15. And if I do, we're good. Anything between five to 15 is a number of like, okay. If you're sub five, like we generally have some problems. And if that is different between one and zero, then like now we zero is a problem. So we should be able to do that. So if a female cannot do 10 full pushups. Yeah. 10 full pushups is hard for a female depending on size. Okay, let's say a female can't do five full pushups. You said rather than go to a knees down version. Yeah. What would you do to assess their muscular endurance and would you then also encourage them to work on their strength? Well, absolutely. So again, if they can't do anything less than three, you're going to be strength. In fact, if you want to look at Musker and Dres in general. So this is a bit of a off topic, but I'll promise I'll keep it short. I'll come right back. When I was a doctoral student, I had two lab mates. One of them was a runner, female, 120 pounds. Something like that, small. And the one was a male. And he was basically like a straight bro. Like he lifts weights, doesn't do any other sort of training. It does like a very classic. Not training program, but kind of training. And they were sort of band-trying back and forth for a while. And basically she was saying, you're so unfit. You can't run it all. And he's saying, you're so weak. You can't do a pull-up. And so they challenged each other to a competition. And to the year, the girl is going to do 26 pull-ups. And the guy had to run a marathon. So 26 miles. So that was the thing. And then there was some sort of consequence for whoever sort of failed it. Till the guy quickly tried to figure out how the hell am I going to run 26 miles when I have not run a mile in like many, many, many years. So he just started running. Three miles, four miles, whatever. She, well, of course, they both ran immediately to me. And then she was like, how the hell I can't do a pull-up. And I was like, great. And I gave her a very specific, maximal strength protocol. And she was like, whoa, I want to go to the assisted pull-up machine and work on doing like sets of 25 because I've got to get my Musker endurance up. And I tried to explain her, your Musker endurance is irrelevant if you can't do one. It's never going to matter. She did the Musker endurance protocol. The entire thing didn't listen to me. The end of the year came. She still produced exactly zero pull-ups. So point is, if you look at Musker endurance, where is it strength and where is it actually Musker endurance? The general sort of number that you're looking for is under like 80%. All right, that's going to tell you is this a Musker endurance problem or is an absolute strength problem. Under 80% of the one repetition maximum. Yep. So what I mean by that is this. In fact, this is actually these in your question. The other way to assess Musker endurance is take the exact strength test you did from the talk five minutes ago. What's what did you do? Load that to 75% and then do that for as many repetitions as you can. And that is a tremendous barometer of Musker endurance. So if you were able to do 200 pounds in your leg extension test, put 75% on that and do that as many reps as you can. You want to look for more than eight repetitions. If you are below eight repetitions, then we have a Musker endurance problem. If it is higher than that, if you got 15 or 20, then we know we have probably some problems in your peak strength. Or the test itself. So that is a good eight to 12 sort of number is where you want to be looking at for there. What about in a robot capacity? This one's more challenging. You either have to go to a laboratory and do something like a win gate test. So this is a 30 second maximal test where you're going to see how much work and you possibly do in that 30 seconds. If you don't have a lattice as a laboratory, you can do this on any protocol you want. This could be sprinting. This can be on an air bike. This could be on a roar or anything like that. Anything where you can exert maximal effort and you don't have to worry about technical problems. So I generally don't like to do things like a kettlebell swing or something like that. There's just too many other variables. You need to be able to go as hard as you possibly can, knowing you're going to get to a place of tremendous fatigue. Now in the lab, we often use what's called a Bosco protocol. And you're going to stand on a force plate and you're going to do as many vertical jumps as fast as you can. It's high as you can for 60 seconds and you're absolutely destroyed by like second 45. So we either use that win gate protocol or that Bosco protocol. If you want though, again, take any of those other places. 30 seconds or so up to 45 seconds up to minute if you want. It doesn't really matter and you just mark down the distance you cover. That's all you we don't really have standard for these things because it's going to be different. How far you can travel in 30 seconds on a treadmill is just going to be so different than sprinting in the field or on the assault bike or whatever. So what you really want to worry about there is can you complete it. And then how awful do you feel afterwards. So what you really want to think about here is not those protocols but this. You want to think about can you get close to your predicted maximum heart rate. So the the number we throw out is 220 minus your age. So if you're 50 years old to 20 minus 50, you should be able to get to a maximum heart rate around 170 beats per minute. Now that number is extremely generic. If you don't get there, that doesn't have any indication of your fitness. If you get higher, that doesn't mean you're any more fit. It's just a rough number. Here's what I want you to do. In this case, your heart rate recovery is the better metric. So I want you to get up to a maximum heart rate. And then test your heart rate recovery. And what you should be looking for there is about half a beat recovery per second. So you're going to get up to a place where you reach like absolute terrible exhaustion. Right. Maximum fatigue. Test your heart rate. And then count right. Have a time or going within 60 seconds. You should have again, that half a beat per second. You should have a heart rate recovery of 30 beats per minute within the next. The next minute. So two minute recovery should be going half that. So 60 beats. Those are rough numbers to go by on your three minute recovery is again half without again. So that is the closest way. If your heart rate recovery is the worst than that, then we know we have a problem in your anaerobic capacity or your cardiovascular capacity. I love it. What about number eight? More heart rate because what you just described sounds a lot like maximum heart rate. So this is your VO2 max. So the goal standard here is to actually go into a laboratory and get this thing done. So we can actually run a VO2 max test where you put a mask on collect all your gasses and run you to there. And there's a very specific protocol for a completion of a true maximum test. And any of the scientists will know that. If you don't have access to that, you can do a couple of tests. One of them is called a 12 minute Cooper test. So this is simply time. You're going to run for 12 minutes as far as you can. And you're going to record the distance you covered. Again, you can go online to any any number of calculators enter that distance in. And that will tell you your proximal or estimated VO2 max. So that's a 12 minute sprint. 12 minutes rent. Maximum distance you can cover in 12 minutes. Keeping a steady pace the whole time or go whatever you want. The goal is to get maximum distance covered in 12 minutes. So that's anywhere between a mile to two plus miles. Bang, how fat you are. But you just do that Cooper 12 minute test. Got it. I told you. All right. So if you remember, a real capacity is eight to 12 sort of minutes where you're going to see a real true test of that VO2 max. You simply can't get that in under a few minutes. So it is a, if you want, you can do a little gentler version of that. So there are a number of sub maximal tests. There in fact, there is a one mile walk test you can do. So again, all you're going to do is in this case you have to have some sort of either a stopwatch or ideally a heart rate monitor. And all you have to do is this is a rock or one mile sub maximal test. So you're going to walk a mile record the time record your heart rate at the end. Enter those in and those will give you again estimates of your views to max. So that's the like, oh my gosh, I can't run for 12 minutes as hard as I possibly can. Or I don't want to do it or we have a lot of these in our executive program. It's like, my knee hurts too bad. I've got back pain when I run or whatever. Can I, okay, and you do the walk test and it's pretty accurate if you do it correctly. So technically all you have to do is measure your heart rate on your, you know, in a count, six seconds. But it's just easier to work with everyone's watchers and stuff now. Just where the heart rate monitor plug in those numbers. And again, those are all standard calculations. So anywhere you find those, you don't have to worry about the source. So you just enter your stuff and they're going to be running out the same equation. I like the idea of the 12 minute run. I'm going to give it a shot. So we did for for years. We did a one mile version of this and there's just a lot more science on the Cooper toolman to Coupre test. So we did that. It's pretty good. And it is not even remotely close to fun. It sounds like fun for other reasons. Yeah. Well, it is it run in the sense that it reveals a lot. Yep. Powerful. Potent super. There's no hiding. You can hide with the leg extension test. It doesn't hurt that pad, but you, you cannot feel anything. But the 12 minute run as far as you can test. So these are really actually psych, psychiatric diagnostic tests. They are of source number nine. Long duration steady state exercise. I think of this as a K.A. endurance. But as you mentioned before, there are other forms of endurance. So long duration steady state exercise. Yep. So you really want to think about this as Not a standard number. This is you should maintain consistent work output for over 20 plus minutes. Okay. And this one I want you to just pick something that it was then your lifestyle. So is there a loop around your house that you can do? Is there some protocol that you like to use before? And you're simply going to test your ability. Can you maintain work without stopping? That's all it needs to be. Now ideally, I personally like the throw little twist in here, Which is, can you do this with nasal breathing only? That's one I feel really good. If you can go 30, 30 minutes without needing to take a break. Walking doesn't really cut it unless you're very, very unfit. In which case, if walking 30 minutes without a break is a challenge. Okay. Like there. But if you can, I want you moving at a non walking pace. I don't care what zone this is. Two, three, four, five. I don't care. Show me you can maintain minimum of 20 minutes of work with no breaks. No intervals, no downtime. And again, ideally, breathing through your nose only. I love this list, but it worries me a bit. Not because any one of these tests is necessarily that overwhelming. But because I'm unclear about how to arrange performance of these different tests. Yeah. For instance, do I separate them? So I'm doing one test like long duration output on one day. And I'm doing strength on another day. Those seem pretty obvious to me. But are there ones that one can combine on different days, how much time should one give oneself in between these tests and how often should one do an assessment? Just as we don't want in the surrelies evaluate body weight changes by getting on the scale three times a day. Maybe one today at the same time each day is more practical. How often should we be assessing our fitness for each and every one of these? Well, the way that I would say this is you want to pick the one that is the worst and do that more frequently. So if, for example, you do the upper body strength test and you are fantastic. If you can bench press double your body weight, I don't need to test your bench very often for the average person. And on the power of your like maybe once a year or maybe not even that, we just don't need to get there. However, if we then test your your VO2 max and in your 12 minutes you cover a total of a half a mile. Then like we might want to test that every month. Right. And so we're going to let our priorities emphasize which one we're going to do. I would recommend doing this full battery once a year. Full battery mean the entire list on one day. But not on one day, but within a week. So you could take a week. Now you could do these technically all in two days. Three days split here is probably best. So if you were to just say, hey, this is like testing week. I actually love this for beginning of the year. Or whenever it is you sort of change your training. But I think once a year, just like once a year, you should probably go to a physician and get full blood work. A full, you know, heart scan and everything like that. And then if maybe you had a heart issue, you come back and test you or frequently whatever the cases, right? You should probably run through this and you're going to be thinking, yeah, but I don't want to like give up on my exercise routine that week. Well, I promise you you're not going to finish this week and think I didn't do very much work this week. It's it's going to feel great. And then you're going to have a very nice barometer of exactly where you need to change and prioritize your training for the next quarter or half a year or wherever you want to go. If you want to actually do this every six months, that's really we end up actually doing this quite honestly like more like every six months as a general test. That's a really good way to do. But if minimum of if you're arguing with me, give me one two year you want to do this. So which order to do them in the non-fatgging test you can do whenever. So this is the the body composition scan the FFMI, the body fat composition all this stuff can be done wherever. I generally like to do that though as your very first activity. The reason is we know that acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition measurements because of inflammation, water storage, etc. So it's easiest to just sort of get that off of a 48 hour rest. You want to make sure you don't do any hard exercise the day before a body composition tests and probably 40 hours before that. So just start yourself off of that. Your movement test can be the same thing. You don't want to try to do a assessment of how well you're squatting. If you're incredibly sore from your brutal squatting test. So tend to do those things when you're the most fresh. Then what you want to do is any skill or maximum strength or power goes at the very beginning of the day. And if a teaguing thing happens at the end. And so you could easily do this. All right. I'm going to do my power test my broad jump. Great. You're not going to be fatigued at all from that. And on the same day since I'm already pretty warm duck. Now I'm going to roll right into my leg strength test. And since I'm really warmed up, I'm going to do my leg muscular endurance test right there. So this is a very common strategy we use. We do our 1-rock match leg extension. Five minutes, seven minutes, whatever we need to do. Come back loaded to 75% do as many reps as you can. Boom. You could roll right into the new upper body test or your grip strength test or anything else that you want to do there. Is there a little bit of influence? Yeah. But really for most people, it's not that bad. What I'm going to impose, I mean, if you do a leg strength test coming back on the other upper body strength test afterwards, it's not that big a deal. Give yourself 15. Give yourself 20 minutes. Keep it plenty of time. So you can knock out your strength testing and muscular endurance testing all on one day. That could be you could do your performance, your skill, diagnostic, your power jump test, your strength and your muscular endurance and all that stuff is knocked out. You're going to have to come back on a separate day and do your anaerobic test. This is 30 seconds maximum endurance things like that. You could though if you wanted do that after your long duration test. Your long duration test is again, is this going to function as like a a b warm up or you could flip those things or you could do them on separate days. You're going to have to do your real to max test on its own day for the most part. Unless you wanted to do again your movement or your body composition sort of before those things. So you really have the ability to kind of mix and match. Ideally, this most realistically probably takes three days. If you want to separate them into four or five, the more separation you do the better data you're going to get. It's just a question of like how, how pedantic are you really trying to get here? And are you willing to lose five percent to then save a whole day? And then you can do sort of things in multiple stacks. So that's that's how I would break up. So what I'm hearing is better to do it than to not do it. Most definitely. And be rational don't don't don't try and do your strength out what laid in the day when you're fatigue. You know, if you're going to combine some of the steady state endurance and maximum heart rate. Fine understand there might be a slight deficit there, but test it the same way each time. And what you're really looking for is improvement. Yep. And you could also do the heart rate recovery under anything modality. So you could do the heart rate recovery after you're able to max as well. So you finish that thing and then just again do the same test for up to three minutes. These are fantastic tools. I'm almost tempted to say that I'm willing to post my numbers, but that actually violates the sort of core principle that I think we're getting out here, which is that it's highly unlikely that anybody is going to be phenomenal across the board. I mean, certainly there will be individuals that are, but based on everything we talked about earlier, specificity of training and how extensively somebody's been training a certain way will without question. Lopside them, if you will. Yeah. Toward being better in some of these assessments and less good in others. And that's just simply the way that these adaptations work. Yep. And it's not. You don't need to be optimal in all these areas to be quote unquote optimal health from this perspective. You just want to make sure again, there's no severe performance actors. So what we call them, right, we don't want any of these severe constraints because you're going to get limited by that thing. And so what you want to do is move that up to just sufficient or concerning and get it away from that. If you do that, that thing's not going to catch you. You're going to be able to continue to pursue pursue optimization in any of the ones that you have a specific passion for, which is generally what moves people, right? You train so that you feel better. You train because you know there are all these benefits to it and to use this audience probably could list hundreds of them. But you also train because you generally like to get better at something. A lot of us like have something. And so you want to make sure that you're not going to hate, I know you're good at endurance, but you really shouldn't train anymore. We don't want that message, not at all. I want you to love your training. We just want to make sure that you're not loving that so much that you're not taking some blinders off and missing another area, which would actually. Again, you pull that performance anchor, this whole ship sales faster with less effort and less friction. What I love about this is also that as you've described it, it's not just for athletes or people that are super in-definness. It's also for people that just want to be healthy and want aesthetic changes and that's why they're exercising, which I think accounts for a really large percentage of people out there. So, so I think what you described is incredibly well structured, incredibly clear and incredibly actionable. So I want to thank you for that. I'm serious about my willingness to do this and at least share those numbers with you. And I think for most people that are seeking what you listed off before, aesthetic changes, functionality and longevity, it's clear that all nine of these are going to be important in some regard or another. So before we close that, I want to go back and finish off the metrics for a VL2 Max, because I don't actually think I gave you numbers on that. So in general, for men, a minimal number we want to look at here is 35 milliliters per kilogram per minute and for women that be about 30. So we can actually push a lot higher on those things in reality. I want to see men above 50. If I could just interrupt you for a second, when you say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters of what specifically. Yeah, so what actually those metrics mean is the first one milliliters is oxygen. So it's a amount of oxygen. Kila grams is body weight. So it's how much oxygen can you bring in per kilogram of body weight per minute. So it is a volume of oxygen per your size and a time duration. In fact, the way that you calculated is you multiply your cardiac output by what's called your AVO2 difference. Your cardiac output is your heart rate times your stroke volume. So how much blood you're pumping out per pump is your stroke volume. How many times you're pumping or you're beating. You multiply that by your AVO2 difference. You have your two differences. Artary minus vein difference. So it's the amount of oxygen in your arteries minus the amount of oxygen in your vein, which is going to tell you how much you took up in your capillaries in your muscles. So you take those two factors and multiply them together and there should be a two max. You know, as you were describing that, I imagine you getting to an FMRI machine and seeing that equation lighting up in your range. Because clearly it's committed to memory very well. Thank you for that clear description. Yeah, so to finish those numbers, I really truly want to see some a man above 50. And I'm not even really stoked until I get above 55. It's sort of funny Dave Costal, who's lab I did my PhD and he was retired by the time, but he's again, one of these legendary figures in exercise physiology started in the 70s. He would always say there's no human excuse to be below 60. Which I was always like damn, that's really actually pretty hard to get to. It was he was he. Oh, he's still actually setting world records like in these last couple of years. And it's like all the master's records for swimming and cycling and stuff. So he was a super, super fit guy. So he was always above 60. He's probably like 50 something now, even though he's 80 or whatever. 80 years old. Yeah. With a VO-250. He's probably really not 50. He's probably, but he's probably going to remember that earlier in that we talked about. I had the 92 year old by the VO-2 Maxis 38. Dave's probably going to break that record when he gets there. I'm sure I'm sure I get in fact, I guarantee you he has that number in his brain. I have a talk to him in 15 years. But I guarantee you that number is in his brain and he's probably training for it. I love it. And I love it because it proves that exercise pays off. Oh, yeah. It's one of the few things in life where there's a direct relationship between work and outcome. Yeah. That's as Henry Rollins described in his wonderful essay. If you're familiar with that. Oh, my gosh. Well, you're a punk rock guy. You know, Henry, I'm sure. I mean, I certainly know who he is. And I know his. He has work in incredible one page paper and sort of something. They do with the iron and he basically describes that as like this is the one thing where it's truth. Like it is the most true thing he'll ever do, which is a love for that. It's almost like a principle of nature. 100%. Yeah. So with with the women, I really want to see the women. If I want to see men above 55, I really want to see women above 50 as the target. And if you're like, you're there, you're pretty good. So you can do the math on the middle ground if what's like okay, but we need to work on it. In fact, if you look across the literature at different athletes, you're going to see like the the really high level endurance folks. You know, they may pass 70 or 80. In fact, there was talk a few years ago of a guy breaking a hundred. That was like an 18 or 19 year old, but I actually don't think it was ever fully confirmed or repeated. But certainly you'll see plenty of people like 95 in those extremes. If you look at other sports like football or basketball, they're probably going to be in the 55 65 sort of range. So if you as an average person or 55, that that's a really good market to be in. If you get even close to that, you're in a good spot. I'm sorry if I let you down Dave. I just love how you're describing this average person. You're looking at me with just a little bit of sympathy like if you if you reach the standard of average and true. Listen, you're giving me prompts all over the place to try and improve my metrics. And I think that's one of the great values of getting objective numbers. Even if they have to be measured by some of these back at the envelope techniques that, you know, I guess we always teach people in the laboratory, right, that a tool can be. Not extremely precise, but as long as it's reliable, there is still value there. I mean, of course you'd love to have the most precise and most reliable tool, but if you can't then at least go for a reliable tool and measure for consistency. Yep, for the real world reliability, beats validity. As much as we can, for a lot of things we're talking about, especially for using it as a metric of, did I get better? As long as that tool is reliable, body composition does all these things have inherent error in them. Some of them are smaller, some of them are larger, but as you mentioned, having standardization within the testing protocol is going to allow you to measure progress. And that's going to tell you, sort of, you're out. Now that we sort of covered all of these areas of adaptation, we walk through the history and we walk through a bunch of the explanations for why people are maybe not getting the results that they want to get through their training. The way I would like to go with the rest of our conversations would be to just go through each of those adaptations step by step and make sure I cover very specific protocols for if you have run through this testing and identify an area of weakness. So maybe you've sort of been lifting a lot because you'd like lifting and you maybe realize that your cardiovascular fitness or your heart rate or your cover is not where it really should be. Or the opposite, like we've talked about, maybe you're doing a lot of that type of work and your strength isn't there, your movement quality is not there. So you've identified a problem. How do I specifically solve it? What are the evidence based and most effective protocols that I could put myself in for each one of these categories? And I think that would give people a lot of tickle value, but it's going to take us some time to cover. So it's going to have to come across over multiple conversations between you and I. Great. Well, I'm looking forward to each and all of those conversations and I want to add just one more metric to our discussion today, which is really just my way of saying thank you because if there were a metric for. And if there's a lot of information about the amount of useful information, percentage spoke, you would be at the upper level of that metric. You have this amazing ability to provide so much knowledge in a clear and concise and today listed out. Format that is both interesting grounded in science and actionable. So on behalf of everyone listening and certainly for myself as well, I just want to say thank you. And I'm looking forward to the next conversation jumping right into speed, strength and I virtually training and what are the evidence based and best practices for protocols in those areas.

vid00008," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are discussing fitness. A fitness of course is vitally important for cardiovascular health or strength for endurance, for lifespan, for health span. I can't think of anyone out there that wouldn't want to have healthy hormonal function, or healthy cardiovascular function, to live a long time and to feel vital that is to have a long health span, as well as a long lifespan. Fitness and fitness protocols are tremendously powerful for developing all of that. However, despite there being an enormous amount of information out there on the internet and in books and elsewhere, you can be a bit overwhelming. So today's episode is really designed to synthesize science-based tools that we've covered on the podcast, some with expert guests like Dr. Andy Galpin or Dr. Peter Atia, or World Renown Movement Specialist Edoportal, or Physiotherapist and Strength and Conditioning Coach Jeff Cavaliere. We've had all of them on its guests on the podcast, and each and every one of them provided a wealth of knowledge in terms of the various things that you can do to optimize very specific or multiple aspects of fitness. Today we're going to do something a little bit different than usual. Typically on the human lab podcast, I offer mechanism upfront or first, and then we talk about protocols that you can use that really lean on those science and science-based mechanisms. Today I'm going to describe a specific protocol that serves as a general template that anyone, in fact, everyone can use in order to maximize all aspects of fitness, so that includes endurance, strength, flexibility, hypertrophy, aesthetic changes, et cetera. However, this general framework can also be modified that is customized to your particular needs. So if you're somebody who really wants to build more strength or bigger muscles, you can change the protocol and the overall program according to that, and I'll talk about very specific ways to do that. Or if you're somebody who really just wants to maintain strength, but you want to build endurance, we'll talk about that. And of course, we will cover real life issues such as should you train if you are sleep deprived. What about food, when should you eat, what if you have any in your hungry, should you still train, et cetera, et cetera? We're going to cover all of that again in the context of this, what I would call foundational template of fitness. And this foundational template of fitness is something that I personally use, in fact, I've used it for over three decades. I don't believe it on that old, but I just recently turned 47, and I still use this basic protocol or template across the week, and modify it according to what my particular goals are, that year, that month, even that day, because I like you live in the real world. And sometimes I've been traveling or I miss a workout, yes, it does happen, or life isn't organized in exactly the way that I need to, in order to have everything go according to the protocol that's on paper. So we're going to discuss real world issues and how to work with the real world issues in order to get the most out of your fitness program. And again, by the end of today's program, I can assure you you will have a template protocol that you can build up from, build out, change and modify, and that will really serve your fitness goals according to the science and what peer reviewed studies and the experts that are appeared on this podcast and other podcasts really tell us is best and optimal for our fitness. I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast is now launched a premium channel. I want to be very clear that the Huberman Lab podcast will continue to be released every Monday at zero cost to consumer, and there will be no change in the format of these podcasts. The premium channel is a response to the many questions we get about specific topics, and it will allow me to really drill deep into specific answers related to those topics. So once a month I'm going to host and ask me anything, so called AMA, where you can ask me anything about specific topics, covered on the Huberman Lab podcast, and I will answer those questions. Those of course will be recorded. They will also be other premium content available to premium subscribers, such as transcripts and short videos of new tools and unique tools for mental health, physical health and performance. If you want to check out the premium channel, you can go to Hubermanlab.com slash premium. There's a $10 a month charge or $100 per year, and I should mention that a large portion of the proceeds from the Huberman Lab premium channel will go to support scientific research that develops the very sorts of tools that we talk about on the Huberman Lab podcast. The rest of the support for the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel will go to supporting the regular Huberman Lab podcast. Again, that's Hubermanlab.com slash premium. Before we dive into today's content about fitness and fitness protocols, I want to tell you about a brand new study that is very exciting and frankly, very unusual. This is a study that was published out of the University of Houston examining a, what I would call a micro exercise or a micro movement, it's a very small movement of a very small portion of your body. In fact, just 1% of your musculature that when it's performed continuously while seated has at least what they report are very dramatic, positive changes in terms of blood sugar, utilization and metabolism. So the title of this study is a potent physiological method to magnify and sustain solius oxidative metabolism improves glucose and lipid regulation. This study was published in I science and as I mentioned earlier, it is getting a lot of attention and it's very unusual. Without going into all the details of this study, let me just briefly give you a little bit of the background. So you have a muscle called the solius, the solius muscle is a more or less wide flat muscle that sits beneath what most people think of as their calf, although it's part of the calf muscle. The other portion of the calf is called the gastrocnemius, the solius sits below that. Now the solius muscle is a unique muscle because it's largely slow twitch muscle fibers, it's designed to be used continuously over and over again for stabilizing your body when you're standing upright. So you're walking, this is a muscle that's designed to contract over and over and over again. In fact, you could walk all day on this muscle and most likely it would not get sore. Do you probably done that and it did not get sore? In contrast, a muscle like your bicep or your tricep, if I were to have you perform hundreds or thousands of repetitions, even with a very light weight, one pound weight or two pound weight. Eventually it would fatigue, you would feel it's sort of a burn there. It's a very unusual set of muscles to use repeatedly, but the solius is an unusual muscle in that it really is designed to be used continuously. Now this study was focused on how people who sit a lot of the day and don't have the opportunity for a lot of physical movement or maybe who don't even exercise at all can improve their metabolism and glucose utilization. Without going into a deep dive about glucose utilization because we've done the deep dive on this podcast episode such as metabolism, etc. You can look those up at huberwinlab.com. They're all timestamped and available there. Anytime you eat, your blood sugar goes up to some extent. So your blood glucose, as it's called, goes up to some extent. And then insulin is a hormone that's used to essentially shaperone and sequester and use that blood glucose. So basically the idea is you don't want blood glucose to go too high. Hyper-insulinemia is something associated with blood glucose that's too high because insulin goes up to essentially match the level of blood glucose. You don't also don't want to be hypoglycemic. You don't want to have blood sugar that's too low. And insulin is involved in both regulating peaks and troughs in blood sugar, blood glucose. So we can basically say, and this is very simple, but we can basically say that you don't want blood glucose to be elevated too much or for too long. That's not good. In fact, people who have diabetes because they don't make insulin, people who have type 1 diabetes do not make insulin at all. Their blood glucose has so high that they actually have to take insulin in order to regulate otherwise. Their blood glucose can go so high that it can damage cells and damage organs that can even kill people. People who have type 2 diabetes are so-called insulin insensitive. They make insulin, but the receptors to insulin are not sensitive to it. And so they make more insulin than normally would be made and blood glucose isn't regulated properly, et cetera, et cetera. The take home message about blood glucose is that you want your blood glucose levels to go up when you eat, but not too high and you don't want them to stay elevated for too long. This study looked at how people who are largely sedentary or at least sitting can increase the utilization, the clearance of glucose from the bloodstream after eating. And they also looked at overall metabolism for people get this that we're using just that 1% of muscle, the solace. By doing it what they call a solace push-ups. The solace push-up can be described very simply as if you're sitting down with your knee bent at approximately right angle, like a square corner, and pushing up or as if they lifting your heel while pushing down on your toe and contracting the calf muscle as it were. And then lowering the heel and then lifting the heel again, lowering the heel, lifting the heel again, each one of those is what they call a solace push-up. This study had people continuously do solace push-ups, and they looked at things like blood glucose utilization, they looked at metabolism and so on. Now a couple of important things about this study before I tell you what they discovered, which was frankly pretty miraculous, almost hard to believe. And yet I believe the data, the data looked to be collected quite well, and there are a lot of statistics, and the study looks to be quite thorough. First of all, they used an equal number of male and female subjects. There were wide range of body mass indices, okay? So this wasn't just super fit people or people that were purely sedentary and not fit. They used a wide variety of ages, time of day, that people who tended to walk a lot or not walk a lot. They measured changes in metabolism and blood glucose utilization in people that had done these solace push-ups while seated in the laboratory. And I must say they had them do these solace push-ups quite a long while continuously. So they had them do it for as long as 270 minutes total throughout the day. So if you divide that that's four and a half hours, you might say well, four and a half hours of lifting the heel and putting the heel down, lifting the heel, putting the heel down. That's a lot. But they didn't always do it continuously. They had some breaks in there. So this is the sort of thing that you could imagine, you or other people could do while seated, while doing zooms or while on calls or maybe even while eating, doing that sort of thing. Although I'm not suggesting that you constantly be focusing on solace push-ups throughout your life. The point is that people who did these solace push-ups experienced dramatic improvements in blood sugar regulation and in metabolism despite the fact that the solace is just 1% of the total musculature. So here I'm going to read from the abstract about what they found. People who did these solace push-ups, despite being a tiny muscle and using very little local energy. In fact, they measured muscle glycogen, the burn, or essentially the utilization of fuel within the muscle, and there was very little utilization of fuel within the solace itself. And that's because the solace has this unique property of needing to basically keep you going all day, walking all day or moving all day. What they saw was a large magnitude, for example, 52% less post-prandendial, that's after a meal, glucose excursion. So 52% less increase in blood glucose and 60%, 60% less hyper-insulinemia, so reduced levels of insulin. They also miraculously observe that despite this being, again, a small muscle, 1% of the total muscle mass, so very small oxidative use. They saw big improvements in systemic metabolic regulation. So this is interesting, and I think something that we should at least know about. I'm not aware that anyone's replicated this study yet. I know there's a ton of excitement about this study in the popular press, and if the data turned out to hold up, which I'd like to imagine they will, I can understand why there's so much excitement. What this means is that if you're somebody who cares about blood glucose regulation, you want to keep your metabolism running, please don't stop exercising the other ways that you exercise. But if you're somebody who wants to maximize your health, doing these solius pushups fairly continuously, while seated, is going to be beneficial. And in addition to that, I know that there are going to be people out there who, for instance, might be injured, or you're traveling and you're stuck on a plane, or you're in the classroom, and you're forced to study all day, or take notes all day, you're just not getting enough opportunity to get those steps that you want to take, whether it's 10,000 or fewer, more getting enough steps or movement, maybe you don't have time to get out and do your run, or maybe you're also running weightlifting and doing yoga classes and things of that sort, but you want to further improve your fitness, at least in terms of your metabolic health. This seems like a terrific, very low investment way to do it, certainly zero cost. It does take a little bit of attention, so you have to divert your attention from other things you're doing to make sure that you're still doing these solius pushups. I'm sure that many of you are going to have a lot of detailed questions such as, you know, how high did they lift the heel, and did they contract the muscle very hard or not? A couple of things about that, they did not have subjects really contract the muscle hard, they did measure the angle of heel raise, and it was anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees, so they didn't have to go way way up on their tipitos or things of that sort. In any event, 270 minutes, four and a half hours of doing these solius pushups is a lot, but by my read of the data and the rather significant, or I should say very significant effects that they observed on blood glucose regulation and metabolism, et cetera. It seems to me that doing less would still be beneficial, and that you don't necessarily have to do the full 270 minutes in order to get the benefits that they observed. More about the study includes the fact that the benefits they observed were very long lasting as long as two hours after a meal, they could still see this improved blood glucose utilization. I don't know because I wasn't able to find it in the methods, whether or not they were doing the solius pushups while they were consuming blood sugar in this study. The point being that if you're somebody who cares about their fitness, this study is interesting, because what it means is that again, if you are forced to be a mobile or sitting longer than you would like, if you're stuck in a meeting or zooms or a class or on a plane, et cetera, or if you're simply trying to add a bit more fitness and metabolic health to your overall regimen. Solius pushups, at least to me, seem like a very low investment, simple, zero cost tool to improve your metabolic health. For those of you that want to prove the study a more detail, we will provide a link to this paper published in my science in the show note caption. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. Now, I've long been a believer in getting regular blood worked done. For the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about hormones, blood lipids, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. Inside Tracker makes understanding all of that very easy and even better points to specific directives. That is, things you can do in terms of your lifestyle, your nutrition, supplementation, et cetera. In order to bring those numbers related to metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera, into the ranges that are optimal for you, your immediate and long-term health.

Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka. Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two all-american swimmers from Stanford, and everything about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I spent a lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly. Roka understands this, and it's designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses to be warning any number of different conditions, and for you to still be able to see with crystal clarity. Now, I wear eyeglasses at night when I work or when I drive, and I wear sunglasses during the day. I don't wear sunglasses when I get my morning sunlight viewing a practice that I'm absolutely religious about every single morning, but throughout the day I wear sunglasses when I drive or when I head in into bright sunlight to protect my eyes. Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are terrific because they were designed for performance, so they were designed for things like cycling and running, so they won't slip off your face if they get sweaty, they're extremely lightweight. In fact, most of the time I can't even remember that they're on my face, they're so lightweight, however, they also can be worn anywhere to work, to dinner, et cetera. They have a terrific aesthetics. Unlike a lot of other performance eyeglasses out there, you can only find in designs that really make people look like a cyborg. Roka makes the cyborg versions, some people like those, but they also make versions of their eyeglasses and sunglasses with frames that you can wear out to dinner, to work, et cetera.

Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs. Sleep is the fundamental layer that is the most important aspect of mental health physical health and performance. I said that before on this podcast, and I'm going to be saying it over and over again, if you're sleeping well, everything else is better, and if you're not sleeping well, everything else gets far worse. So sleep is vital, and sleeping on the correct mattress is absolutely vital. He looks understands this, and they have a brief quiz that you can take. So you simply go to their website, you take this quiz, ask you questions, such as you tend to run hot or cold during the night, you tend to sleep on your back, your side, your stomach, or maybe you don't know, and they match you to a mattress that's ideal for your particular sleep needs. For me, that was the dusk mattress, DUSK, I've been sleeping on a dusk mattress for well over a year now, and it's the best sleep I've ever had. If you'd like to try Helix mattress, you can go to Helix Sleep.com-huberman. Take that brief two-minute sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress for your sleep needs. You'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders and two free pillows. Again, if you're interested, you go to Helix Sleep.com-huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows. The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous Supplements. To find the supplements we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast, you can go to live-momentous spelled OUS, live-momentous.com-slash-huberman. And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's live-momentous.com-slash-huberman. Let's talk about fitness. Let's talk about how you can develop the optimal fitness protocols for you. So that includes what to do each day of the week, and your fitness protocol across the week and indeed across the month and the year and even year to year. When we had Dr. Andy Galpin on the podcast, he said something very important that we want to keep in mind today, which is concepts or few methods are many. That is, there are an infinite number of different programs and exercises and set-in reps, schemes, and different runs, and burpees, and push-ups, etc., etc., that one can follow. However, there are really just a few basic concepts or principles of muscle physiology, of cardiovascular function, of connective tissue function that provide or set the basis for the adaptations that we call fitness or that lead to fitness. So I'm going to list those off now. We can talk about a fitness protocol that's really aimed mainly toward developing skill. That's one, or speed. That's another, or power, which is speed times strength, or specifically strength, or hypertrophy, growth of muscles, or endurance, such as muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is, for instance, your ability to stay in a plank position, or to do a wall-sit, you know, to sit on an invisible chair against a wall, or other forms of endurance like near pure anaerobic endurance. So a one-minute sprint, or less, or a one-minute all-out cycling on stationary bike, this sort of thing, or endurance that occurs in the kind of three to 12-minute total duration range. So that might be sprints or high-intensity interval type training. It could be a all-out swim. It could be all-out row. That's another form of endurance taps into different fuel systems, aspects of muscle physiology, et cetera. And then endurance that lasts 30 minutes or more, which is typically what people think about when they think about endurance. But of course, the other forms of endurance matter. So we've got skill, speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, and aerobic endurance. What I would call three to 12-minute endurance, although it goes by other names as well, and 30 minutes or more endurance type exercise and adaptations. Each and every one of these requires different principles, different concepts in order to improve, say, your muscular strength, your hypertrophy, or both. However, there's a general theme that sits beneath all adaptations leading to fitness. And that's what we're really going to set down as the base layer, the foundation of everything we talk about today. And that's that we need to think about what are the modifiable variables. Again, I'm borrowing directly from the episode with Dr. Andy Yelpin. He was the one that said, modifiable variables are the key thing to think about, what are you going to modify? What are you going to change in order to increase one or some of the various things I listed off before, or skill speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera. And some of the key concepts that emerge from that discussion are that we need to think about progressive overload, normally when people hear about progressive overload, they think about adding more weight to a bar, picking up heavier dumbbells. But that could also be progressive overload in the context of running up a hill of steeper incline, or running a little bit faster, a little bit further, and so on and so forth. Now, as I promised earlier today, we are not going to drill into each and every one of the mechanisms that underlie the different adaptations that are going to develop speed and strength and endurance, et cetera, because that was covered in the podcast with Dr. Andy Yelpin and the other podcast with experts that I mentioned earlier. And we again will provide links to those podcasts if you want to drill into those mechanisms. Instead, what we are going to do is we're going to start with a program that essentially is designed for you to maximize all aspects of fitness, to the extent that you can simultaneously maximize all aspects of fitness, but then to change or modify that protocol so that if you want to build up more for instance strength and you want to just hold on to the endurance you have. You don't want to build endurance, at least not in that weaker that month. You can do that, or if you want to improve your endurance while maintaining your strength, you can do that. And so on and so forth. Most people I do believe would like a combination of strength and endurance and flexibility and maybe even hypertrophy, particularly for certain muscle groups that maybe are not as well developed as other muscle groups. They want to bring balance to their physique, both for sake of aesthetics and for sake of health and for sake of general functioning, maybe even to eliminate pain. The protocol that I'm going to describe really works as a foundational template for that as well. So let's drill into that foundational protocol and I'll keep referring to it as the foundational protocol, not because it's the one that I use, although it is the one that I use and not because it's the one that we're talking about today, although it's the one we're talking about today. But because we need some general framework from which to build out the more specific protocols that we'll get into in a bit more detail later. So in this foundational protocol for fitness, what you'll notice is that on any one given day, you're going to focus on one particular aspect of fitness. Maybe it's endurance, maybe it's strength, maybe it's hypertrophy, in particular it might be hypertrophy for a particular muscle group or muscle groups. That said, across the entire week, it's designed to bring fitness and different forms of fitness to all aspects of your body. So this particular protocol begins on Sunday, although that's simply the day that I happen to begin the protocol. And again, this protocol is not important because it's the one that I follow. I follow it because it is important. In other words, it's a protocol that's really green from the scientific literature and the experts that is for you. So this fitness protocol is really about you. I just may refer to it as the one that I follow simply for ease of communication. And for me, my week begins on Sunday. So I do my very best to get a workout in on Sunday. And for me, that workout is that of a endurance workout. It's designed to either maintain or increase my endurance. And the endurance type that I'm referring to is endurance of 30 minutes or more. So for me, the goal is always to get either 60 to 75 minutes of jogging. So this would be so called zone two cardio. People probably have heard of zone two cardio, but if you haven't, that's okay zone two cardio is something that you could measure with a heart rate monitor or other device, but you don't need to zone two cardio is the kind of cardiovascular exercise in which you're pushing yourself to move such that you're breathing faster than normal. Your heart is beating faster than normal. However, you are still able to sustain a conversation, but if you were to push yourself any harder, that is, move faster or go up a steeper inclined at the same rate. You happen to be at any one moment. You would lose that ability to speak. You wouldn't be able to complete sentences. You would be out of breath. You'd have to pause mid sentence. Now it's near impossible even with a heart rate monitor to stay exactly in zone two, unless you're very, very skilled at that. So I don't obsess over that, and in fact I don't wear a heart rate monitor when I do this exercise, but for me, the goal is to head out on Sunday and get 60 to 75 minutes of jogging in zone two. Now of course, I like to jog with that doesn't mean that you have to jog. You could replace jogging with rowing on a rowing machine or maybe even rowing an actual boat. If you have access to that or cycling or swimming, something that allows you continuous movement for 60 to 75 minutes at that zone two threshold. We talked about earlier. For me, that can include some hills and when I say hills, they could be very steep hills, but I simply slow my pace down. In order to stay in that roughly zone two range, or it could be that they are more low grade hills, and I might just slow down a little bit, or I might even push myself a tiny bit that day, but really I'm just trying to build that long endurance. I'm trying to build up my capacity or maintain my capacity to go along distance without fatiguing. Now some days, meaning some some days, since I tend to do this almost always on Sunday, although there are exceptions, instead of doing the 60 to 75 minute jog, what I'll do is I will head out for a long hike that could be two and a half hours or three hours or maybe even a four or five hour hike. Sometimes it's very long and I'll do that sometimes simply to mix up the routine because sometimes jogging and jogging the same routes gets boring to me. I do enjoy running, that's something I've been doing for a very long time, but sometimes it just gets a little bit tedious and I want to do something different. Also sometimes I want to be social on Sundays, I want to head out on a hike with my partner, or I want to meet up with friends and hike with them. And so taking a long hike on Sunday is something that also could be quite social, and then I don't have to worry about also getting in my workout when heading out on a hike with my partner or going out to meet with friends or things of that sort. I will say that there's a specific tool or a specific change that you can make to this Sunday long endurance or at least what I consider long for me. I mean, it's by no means a marathon or an Ironman, but this long endurance training. And that's the use of a weight vest. So something that I've really started utilizing more recently and by more recently, I really mean within the last year or so is I purchased one of these weight vest that can be anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds. What I use in the weight vest is irrelevant, but it's certainly changes the level of effort required when taking a hike or even a walk. Now there's an additional benefit of the weight vest, which is that if you are going out for a hike or even for a walk for social reasons and you're with somebody that's not quite at the same fitness level that you are. Frankly, it's a little bit rude to just keep walking ahead of them and running back or running ahead and running back. You know, oftentimes you really want to spend time with the person and you don't want them to feel as if they're holding you up. And so the weight vest is a terrific way to get some additional work. Then as you'll find if you wear a weight vest, it is additional work on say a shorter hike. So maybe the person you're with only has time for an hour long hike or maybe they just don't have the fitness to do a two hour or three hour hike. So I'll throw on the weight vest and I'll head out for a walk with them or a hike with them or sometimes I'll go out on a long hike with the weight vest myself. So again, the point of this for me Sunday, although it could fall on any day for you, workout is really to build up that long form endurance. And this fits well with what Dr. Andy Galpin and Dr. Peter Ratea referred to as the real need to get in some long endurance type work at some point or even multiple points throughout the week. For me, this long Sunday jog of 60 to 75 minutes or long Sunday hike or weighted walk or weighted hike really accomplishes that goal. Sometimes leads to a little bit of soreness, particularly my calves or if I'm wearing the weight vest, sometimes my midsection. We'll get sore because I'm trying to remain upright. So I think it also builds up some muscular endurance, not just cardiovascular endurance. Again, throughout the entire time that I'm jogging or hiking, what I'm trying to get to is a place where I can feel that my pulse rate is definitely elevated, but it's not so elevated that have to stop because I'm out of breath. And because I know some people out there might be really neurotic about this sort of thing. If you have to stop because you're out of breath, that doesn't mean that you blew the workout that you know aren't getting endurance. Of course, you're getting benefits from it. So I'm not absolutely neurotic about always staying exactly in that heart rate zone. I might stop and have a conversation for a moment if it's a longer hike. Although I really try and keep moving and I try and push myself just a little bit further than where I'm exceedingly comfortable. And so for me, doing this long Sunday hike or jog really provides a foundation of base for endurance, but then the other endurance workouts that I'll describe later in that type place later in the week can build on. Now, as I mentioned earlier, we will get back to the mechanisms that this taps into and why this is so useful. There are multiple benefits to doing these kinds of endurance type workouts and zone two cardio. But by putting it at the start of my week, again, my week starts on Sunday, I'm sure that regardless of how the rest of the week goes, that I got my endurance training in. And of course, I'm going to want to and I will do endurance training other days during the week, but if something comes up or I happen to get sick or I'm really behind in terms of work and I can't get to the workouts in this Sunday long jog or hike really provides that fundamental. I can honestly say foundation for cardiovascular fitness and endurance that I can hang my hat on and say, okay, I've got that one in the bag and I can then look to other days of the week to focus on other aspects of fitness. Now, a really important point to make about this Sunday endurance workout is that allows you to check off a box and that box is 75 or so minutes of zone two cardio because as you may have heard. Either in this podcast or from others out there, like Dr. Peter Tia, getting 180 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week has enormous positive effects on longevity and enormous positive effects on general health. Again, in terms of cardiovascular function, it also met a ballad fuel utilization also in terms of your musculature and your ability to use your body over long distances for long periods of time. So while it doesn't complete all 180 to 200 minutes per week, it certainly gets you a good distance pun intended toward that goal. Now, I want to acknowledge that some people might be starting a fitness program and so 60 to 75 minutes of jogging might be too long or a three hour weighted vested hike or some people might even do what's called a rock like you are a rucksack that might be too much in which case certainly start with less and go on flat ground and go at the rate that allows you to get into zone two. But that is not excessively difficult for you and then as you build up fitness, you can add time or you can add weight through a weight vest or if you don't want to buy a weight vest or can't afford one. As a simple solution to that, I actually have a good anecdote about that one time I was heading out for a hike with a friend of mine, he was a former seal team operator. I'll never forget this and he said, oh yeah, I'll bring you a sack and I thought he meant like a sack lunch like he was going to bring lunch and I showed up and he visited me a backpack that was loaded with a bunch of stuff in the backpack weight about 40 pounds and then we took a hike. I was thinking lunch, he was thinking weighted backpack and a weighted backpack or even just any kind of strong sack that you can put over your shoulders or even carry in your arms. It's going to work exceedingly well to build in some extra requirement for effort. So you certainly don't have to purchase a weight vest in order to in order to get the benefits of bringing additional weight along with you on these long cardiovascular events. But again, build up over time, you can add time, you can add weight and that's also a really nice feature of adding weight, which is at some point. Your schedule might be such or you just don't really want to keep adding more and more and more and more time on this long endurance Sunday. In this case, work out. In that case, add weight. You can also, as you build up fitness, you can add speed to it. Your zone two and what zone two is won't shift, but what work is required from you in order to get into zone two will shift. That is, as you get more and more fit, you'll have to move faster and or bring more weight in order to stay in zone two. And that will simply tell you that you are indeed improving your endurance. Okay, so then Monday rolls around and I like most everyone else out there. I work on Monday. I get right into my emails and preparation for podcasts and running my laboratory, etc. However, I make sure that at some point on Monday and for me that some point is typically and ideally early in the morning. So 7am or so. I train my legs on Monday. So that includes quadriceps, hamstrings and calves. Why do I do that workout on Monday and what is that workout designed to do? Well, that workout is really designed to make sure that I'm either maintaining or building strength into my legs. And this is not simply for aesthetic reasons. This is not simply to grow bigger calves or grow bigger quadriceps and hamstrings. Although it can't accomplish that as well, depending on how you train. We'll talk about details of training. The reason for training legs on Monday is several fold. First of all, they are the largest muscle groups of the body. And by training your legs on Monday, it sets in motion a large number of metabolic processes that carry you some distance even through the whole week in terms of elevating metabolism in terms of amplifying certain hormonal events in your body, etc. That are really beneficial. In addition to that, I'm of the belief that the legs are the foundation of the body and provided you can train legs safely. That training legs is vitally important, not just for strength of the legs, but also for strength of your entire body. Again, some of that is through systemic hormonal effects because if you're going to train the large muscle groups of your body under substantial loads, you will get systemic release of hormones, not just testosterone or those certainly testosterone, but also things like growth hormone. You get increases in all sorts of so-called anabolic hormones that even if you're somebody who's not trying to increase muscle size because I realize a lot of people are not trying to do that. These are hormones that shift your metabolism and your overall tendon strength and ligament strength and overall musculature into what I would call a strong foundation. So for me, Monday is leg workout. It also just feels good to get the leg workout out of the way early in the week and it accomplishes another goal, which is that I sometimes will take one or two days off of a leg workout because they can be very intense and they are large muscle groups. And I'll explain what I do on the off days. They're not pure off days. They actually include some recovery type training or even some all-out training. But by training legs on Monday, I'm able to get what I consider the hardest strength and hyperchivity workout out of the way and again set all those positive physiological effects in motion for the entire week. The other thing is that no workout exists in isolation. What you do one day is going to be determined by what you did the previous day. And even though the previous day I may have taken a three hour weight vested hike, never are my legs so sore from that long slow endurance work because it is long and slow, that I'm unable to train legs. Contrast that with a high-intensity interval training workout which comes later in the week and my legs might be sore. In fact, they might not even be recovered such that I'm able to do a real leg workout. And I say, real workout, I'll describe what that means in a moment. So legs come on Monday and I think that for those of you that are using or interested in using resistance training, I suggest getting your leg workout done early in the week. And for those of you that have heard the phrase, you know, don't skip leg day, I will go a step further and say don't skip leg day and fit. In fact, make leg day your first day of strength and hyperchrophy training put it on Monday. Okay. So now that we're talking about resistance training, the question is going to come up about sets and reps and all of that business. That was covered in a lot of detail on the podcast with Dr. Andy Galpin and I'm going to get into some of that detail now. But I'm going to wait until I describe the entire set of workouts for the week before I go into even more detail because there's a way of what's called periodizing that is changing the sets and reps, et cetera, across the week and indeed from month to month. That's really optimal. But I don't want to make it seem as if all of that just pertains to the leg workout. It actually pertains to all of the resistance training. So I'll just give you a couple of teasers about the key principles of resistance training that I think are almost universally, if not universally, then generally accepted in the strength training and physiology community. And then later I'll get back to some of the overarching principles that apply to all strength and hypertrophy workouts across the week, including the ones for the torso, the arms, et cetera. Okay. So legs fall on Monday. I should say that leg workouts like all resistance training workouts for me consist of about, again, I'm not neurotically attached this, but about 10 minutes of warming up. And then about 50, 5, 0 to 60 minutes of real work. Now, of course, some of that is going to be rest between sets, but by real work, I mean, really hard work, not necessarily to failure. We'll talk about failure in a little bit. But hard work where I'm struggling to complete the final repetitions, if not going to failure to continue to move the weight repetitions. And again, the entire work portion of that workout is about 50 to 60 minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, you start getting increases in cortisol that really impede recovery. And I personally, I'm somebody that does not recover very well from high intensity exercise. I realize that within the literature, it is believed and I think generally accepted that when you stimulate muscle hypertrophy or strength increases, it impacts the nervous system. It also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera. There are a number of different forms of adaptation that occur to give you muscle strength and size changes. And these days, people talk a lot about needing to stimulate muscle growth or muscle strength at least every 48 hours. But I can tell you that I recover out there slowly and I benefit from working the same muscle group about twice per week with longer, or I should say, more days of rest in between those workouts. So if I train legs on Monday, believe it or not, I'm only training legs on Monday. I do not have a second leg workout during the week. However, on Friday, I do a high intensity interval training session that serves two purposes. One is it serves the purpose of triggering a certain type of endurance and getting my heart rate very, very high. And in addition to that, because of the way I do that workout, it acts as a sort of supplement or a more moderate intensity workout for quadriceps, hamstrings and calves, such that I at least never lose strength. In fact, generally build strength from one leg workout to the next provided I'm doing things correctly. So what I'm not referring to is a kind of classic, you know, super high intensity training once per week, and then not actually training that muscle group again. For me, it's really training each muscle group twice per week once directly, and then once indirectly, either during another weight training workout or during a cardiovascular rush is a endurance training workout. Legs on Monday, the workout is 50 to 60 minutes after a brief warm up. I generally pick two exercises per muscle group. So again, I'm doing calves. I'm doing quadriceps and I'm doing hamstrings. You should pick the exercises that work for you. So that's why I'm actually not going to share, which exercises I use. I'll give you a couple of suggestions about the ones I do use, but really exercise selection is Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out is a very important variable. And the key thing to emphasize for that variable is that you need to be able to perform the movement safely. So I know there's a huge debate out there and people love to argue about whether or not one can squat or deadlift for long periods of time or should or should not. Some people say you absolutely should. I personally do not squat and do not deadlift. I've actually never done much squatting or deadlifting. I know some people out there are probably rolling their eyes or switching the channel at this point. But I can say that for me, I've been able to achieve the strength and high-perature fee goals that I've been seeking doing things like leg extensions and hack squats or for hamstrings doing things like leg curls and glute ham raises or for calves doing standing and seated calf raises and so on. I think a key principle that everyone should pay attention to is one that was taught to me by an excellent strength coach years ago, and I still use this and at least it works for me. For each muscle group, try and find an exercise in which you get that muscle into a weighted stretch position. So this would be for instance the standing calf raise, you know, down at the bottom it's weighted and you're in a deep stretch provided you're doing the movement correctly. As well as another exercise where you're getting contraction in the shortened position of the muscle. So for the hamstrings that would be the leg curl for the calves it would be a seated calf raise. Or for the quadriceps, the leg extension is, you know, if the machine is designed right and you're doing it correctly, the peak contraction is largely going to occur at the legs extended position. But then another exercise for each muscle group that puts the muscle into more of a stretched or at least a larger range of motion or compound type movement, but ideally where there's some stretch there. So I guess I will tell you what exercise exercise exercise I do for the quadriceps is going to be leg extensions and hack squats, I use hack squats because I don't do free bar squats for safety reasons. And I like the hack squat machine, I'll do leg curls and glue ham raises for hamstrings and I'll do standing calf raises and see calf raises for the calves. Again, those are the movements that I use because I can perform them safely in the repetition ranges and with the weights that are required for me to either maintain or build leg strength and calf strength. But you might decide that for you dead lifts are absolutely essential and terrific or squats for you bar squats are absolutely terrific or front, you know, front squats. I'm not here to tell you which exercise is to do or not do. I am telling you that it's probably wise to at least consider doing at least two exercises per muscle group probably three maximum. If you ask me if you're doing your entire legs and calves in one day, but to think about doing one exercise where the muscles brought into that shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls or leg extensions or cd calf raise and then another exercise for each muscle group, where there's more of a elongation and maybe even a stretch on the muscle group. In fact, that's a principle that you'll hear me talk about later when I talk about training other muscle groups for strength and hypertrophy. So now you know approximately how long to train. You might be somebody who can get away with training for an hour and a half and that won't impede you recovery for me that really starts to impede my recovery. Also, if I'm staying on task that 60 minute limit really works well for me. Do I occasionally train for 75 minutes? Yes, because if I'm waiting for a piece of equipment sometimes, I have to just wait longer so that happens, but I really try and keep the total duration of the workout shorter. How many sets and reps and rest intervals? Well, that was covered by Dr. Andy Galpin as well without getting into the total science. Here's a brief summary of how to structure that. It's pretty clear that if you're going to do lower repetitions and heavier weights that you're going to want to do a bit more volume. I know that this spits in the face of what a lot of people think, but so if you're going to do five sets of five, I would consider five repetitions low repetition range heavier weight. And if you're going to train with higher repetitions, you can do fewer sets. That certainly works for me. I generally follow a program where for about a month, so three to four weeks, I will do all my resistance training in the repetition range of about four to eight repetitions. So that's rather heavy. You more sets, so it might be anywhere from three to four sets per exercise, again, still just two exercises and longer rest between sets anywhere from two minutes to maybe even four minutes if it's really heavy legwork. And then for the next month, switch to repetition range that's closer to eight to twelve, maybe even fifteen repetitions per set, but do fewer sets overall. So maybe just two to three sets per exercise again just two exercises per muscle group typically. Shorten the rest between sets so that it's more in that 90 second, maybe even in a short 60 seconds rest between sets, but typically 90 seconds to about two minutes or two and a half minutes. So basically it's one month heavier the next month slightly lighter, although I wouldn't say light, I would say moderate weight and moderate rep range. That tends to work well for me. It also adheres to a principle that came up during the discussion again with Dr. Andy Galpin that for high-purchar fee, you really can use repetition ranges anywhere from five to thirty three zero rep. But he emphasized changing the repetition ranges in order to offset boredom. Frankly, I like to train heavier, I enjoy training in the four to eight rep range. However, I noticed that if I do that for more than four weeks in a row and I don't switch over to training in the eight to twelve, maybe in fifteen repetition range for about a month. Well then I can't make continuous progress, I start to actually lose ground, but by switching back and forth, I actually can make continuous progress at least across the year. So I hope that that principle or I should say that protocol was communicated clearly. It works very well, I assure you. Does that mean that I never get ten repetitions on a week when I'm supposed to train in the four to eight repetition range? No, occasionally I'll venture up into the ten repetition range. But I really try and cluster the low repetition work for about a month, again across all workouts and all exercises and the slightly higher out, do you say moderate repetition work across to the next month. One thing that you'll notice since we are talking about total fitness programming is that during the month, where you are doing moderate repetitions, you'll notice that your endurance work will actually be facilitated. And I do not think that's a coincidence, in fact it's not a coincidence, it's because when you are training very heavy or in the heavier range, low repetitions, etc. You're tapping into different processes in those muscles, so when you head out for that long Sunday hike or as you'll soon hear, whereas on Friday you're going to do high-intensity interval training. Well, you'll notice is during certain months of weight training when you're training more heavy, those workouts will feel, literally, will feel different than they will during the months when you're doing moderate repetition work. I am not a competitive athlete, I'm not running races or triathlons like some of my friends, I'm very impressed by them. I'm really just trying to get overall cardiovascular fitness, overall strength, overall hypertrophy where I need it, maintain muscle size, etc. In muscle groups where I'm just trying to maintain, that's really my goal. So I'm not trying to optimize any of these workouts for any one performance feature, but in a little bit we'll talk about how you can change various aspects that is variables of this protocol in order to say for instance, really emphasize hypertrophy or really emphasize endurance. Okay, so with what I would call a standard endurance workout done on Sunday, and I say standard because most people when they hear endurance, they think of the ability to endure, to continue, and repeat it, move mentor exercise over some period of time, with that workout done on Sunday, and then with the leg workout done on Monday, you can feel really good about how you're heading into the week. However, after training legs on Monday, I experience that doing cardiovascular workouts the next day is either inefficient or at least doesn't really allow me to completely recover from my leg workout. I realize that some people are going to immediately scoff at that, and in fact, there are really beautiful papers out there talking about how one can actually do a fair amount of cardiovascular exercise without interfering with their strength and speed and hypertrophy improvements. And vice versa. In fact, there's a terrific review that was mentioned on the podcast with Dr. Andy Gelpin. This is a review that will provide a citation to an reference and a link to, which is the review by Murak and Bagley, which talks about whether or not there's interference between strength and endurance workouts. Really interesting review if you want to approve that. But with all that said, I like to take Tuesday as a no endurance, no resistance training day, but that doesn't mean that I'm not doing anything for my overall health and fitness. On Tuesdays, I do a series of heat cold contrast. In other words, I get really really warm and then I get really, really cold. I get really really warm and I get really, really, really called repeatedly. And the way I do that is by getting into a hot sauna, so for me that's really hot, but I've built up my heat conditioning, so please don't do this unless you've built up your ability to withstand heat. And I'll get in for about 20 minutes, sometimes 15, but usually 20 minutes, then I get out and then I will get into an ice bath or a cold water bath that's about 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Again, don't get into water that's so cold that you go into shock. I'll explain what a good cold stimulus could be for you and how to determine that. Or if I don't have access to my sauna and my ice bath, what I can do if I'm traveling is I will take a hot bath and then alternate with cold shower, hot bath cold shower. It's hard to do hot bath ice bath unless you have two baths. I don't know any hotel rooms, at least I've never stayed in one that has two baths, I'll let them share their out there. But for me, this is heat cold contrast and really what this day is about is two things. First of all, I'm trying to accelerate recovery from the leg workout I did previously. Also, if you listen to our episode of the human lab podcast about deliberate heat exposure or you listen to our episode of the human lab podcast about deliberate cold exposure. I talk about some of the benefits of heat and cold and I get into a lot of details about how you can access heat. You can do baths, you can do sauna, you can take hot showers. If you don't have access to any of that, you can even wrap your body from the neck down in garbage bag, plastic garbage bags. Believe you're not wrestlers used to do this. Put on some sweats and go running though, get you warm again be careful not to overheat and then you can get into a cold shower. So there's a lot of ways depending on your budget and what you have access to. I don't use cryo, these cryotherapy chambers, they're hard to find, they're expensive. Again, I use sauna and ice bath and I will do anywhere from three to five rounds, which is a lot anywhere from three to five rounds of heat for about 20 minutes and cold for about five minutes. How cold should the cold be? We covered this in the episode on deliberate cold exposure. Here's a general rule of thumb. It should be cold enough that you really want to get out, but not so cold that it's unsafe. And that will vary from person to person. So I can't give you a simple prescriptive there. Same thing with the heat. Hot enough that you're sweating and that you want to get out, but not so hot that you're running the risk of injuring yourself or killing yourself. And again, that will vary from person to person. So you have to build up slowly, be careful and build up empirically. I do that on Tuesdays again as a way to accelerate recovery and because it's very clear that their cardiovascular benefits may be even benefits for the brain. Related to the cardiovascular benefits because of course the brain needs a lot of blood flow and needs a lot of nutrients and other things flowing into and out of there debris out and nutrients and other things into the brain. Heat can help accelerate that or improve that. And so I'm doing that to improve cardiovascular function improve brain health. And then the cold contrast provides a sort of accelerator on that or an amplifier. I think it's the better way to phrase it on that process because in the cold you get vaso constriction and then in the heat you get vaso dilation and so you're maximizing that process, which is actually a neural process. And it's actually the blood vessels and capillaries and even the arteries in order to allow that constriction and dilation process to occur. So Tuesday is really about recovery, but my recovery day isn't necessarily about just laying around and not doing anything. I might still also take some walks that day. Remember, I want to try and get that 200 minutes of zone 2 cardio across the week and sometimes not often, but sometimes I'll get in a few minutes or more of walking quickly that day. But generally I'm working a lot on Tuesday as I do on Monday and I'm a little bit tired to maybe even a little bit sore from my leg workout, the previous day Monday. So I try and get that hot cold contrast. There are other benefits to hot and cold contrast. We have a description of the different protocols for hot and for cold and their contrast and our human lab newsletter. You can find that by going to hubrimlab.com, go to the newsletter tab under the menu and you can sign up. You can actually download those protocols very easily without even signing up if you just want to access straight off. So Tuesday is really about recovering about getting some additional cardio vascular benefits from heat cold contrast. One other thing that's built into the rationale for doing a lot of heat and cold on one day as opposed to doing it every day. Well, in addition to it being a little bit more convenient because certainly some people don't access to heat and cold, sauna and cold dongs, etc. Every day, so maybe getting to do that one day is more accessible or feasible. But in addition to that, it's very clear that while there are benefits to doing sauna often, we talked about this in the deliberate heat episode and the episode with Dr. Rhonda Patrick when she was a guest on this podcast. It's also clear that if you do sauna seldom, that is once a week, but you do a lot of it on one day. So in this case, it's an hour, if it's, remember, it's more, it's three to five rounds of 20 minutes of sauna followed by about five minutes of cold or so. By doing that all on one day, the pure viewed research that's covered in the episode on deliberate heat. This is a study out of Finland showed that you get massive even 16 fold increases in growth hormone, which are extremely beneficial for metabolism and for recovery. So these massive increases in growth hormone are seen when you are doing these sessions of sauna that are repeated on the same day and you're only doing that about once a week. Whereas if you do sauna more often, there are certainly benefits to that, but it's time consuming and you need access to sauna more often the one day a week if you're doing it more the one day a week. But if you do it one day a week and you're doing a lot of sessions within that day, as I've detailed here, you see these massive increases in growth hormone that are not observed if you're doing so. I'm more often, I'm more often, I'm more often, I'm more often, I'm more often, I'm more often. Now the effects of cold are many, it's not just vasoconstriction, but the effects of cold are also counterbalance by some of the problems with deliberate cold exposure. And maybe you've heard about on this podcast and a lot of other podcasts and seem to be a kind of a buzz theme on Twitter and elsewhere. And the point is that there are a number of quality studies showing that if you do deliberate cold exposure in particular ice baths or getting into very cold water. And then the after an endurance training session or a strength and high-perchography session. It can indeed, yes, it can disrupt or prevent some of the adaptations that you are seeking with strength and high-perchography and endurance workouts. You heard that right and I believe that to be true based on now several quality peer-reviewed studies. So by doing your deliberate cold exposure on Tuesday, you're not going to get those effects. That is the blocking of high-perchography or the blocking of strength improvement or the blocking or prevention of improvements and endurance. That would occur if you immediately got into the ice bath after a high-perchography strength or endurance workout. Now the caveat to that is if you are somebody who likes to do cold showers, I am not aware of any data that says that cold showers cannot be performed after a strength high-perchography or endurance workout. Cold showers are different than submerging up to the neck in an ice bath or another cold body of water for a number of different reasons. In fact, they tap into different aspects of the nervous system entirely. We don't have time to go into that now. It's covered in the episode on deliberate cold exposure. But the simple point is by doing your heat and cold contrast or, hey, listen, if somebody doesn't have access to sauna, you don't like hot baths and you just do some deliberate cold exposure on Tuesday. You are doing that separate from your strength and high-perchography and endurance workouts such that it will not impede the benefits of those workouts. Okay, so long endurance on Sunday, leg resistance training on Monday and on Tuesday, heat cold contrast. That brings us to Wednesday and on Wednesday we get back to a resistance training workout. And the resistance training workout that I emphasize on Wednesday is one in which you train your torso. Yes, literally your torso. I know this is counter to this, I'll call, bro science of bro splits. I don't know who originated that term. It's a terrible term. Essentially, alienates anyone who's not a bro or considers themselves a bro. But in any case, this is not about training chest or back or shoulders. In fact, it's really about strengthening the muscles of the torso. And of course, includes the chest and the shoulders and the back. And I'm sure, as I say this, a number of people out there who are obsessed with hypertrophy and muscle growth and filling out their shirts or whatever. It may be, I think, oh no, you know, this is just kind of all around fitness. But no, the point is on Wednesday, you train your torso. And that's going to involve some pushing. So that's good for you that might include some training of things like bench presses or incline presses as well as shoulder presses or lateral raises. Things for the shoulders as well as for the back. Some pulling exercises, these could be bent over rows or chin ups or pull ups. There are enormous number of exercise for each and every one of these muscle groups. Now, I believe there's a clear benefit to training all these muscle groups together on the same day. Because much in the same way that training legs all on one day can lead to these systemic effects because they're large muscle groups. Working both the pushing muscles and the pulling muscles of the torso on one day, at least in the context of this program, is very time efficient. And tends to wick out into a number of different dimensions of health, that at least I'm interested in and I think a lot of other people are interested in. What are those? Well, let's think again. I want to be strong in not just my legs, but my upper body. I also may want to engage some hypertrophy to grow certain muscle groups in order to create a sense of balance. I could be first static reasons, but also for balancing strength and for health and the integrity of the joints, et cetera. And in addition to that, by training a bunch of different muscle groups together, you have the opportunity to get the more systemic hormonal effects. And metabolic effects that occur when you're not just training one muscle group in isolating that one muscle group, but rather training a bunch of muscle groups together. So when say a trained torso and I do that in push pull fashion, just for kind of time efficiency, sometimes that means doing a pushing exercise and then a pulling exercise, sometimes it might even mean doing a set of pushing and then a set of pulling and going back and forth. However, if you're in a gym and a particular crowded gym, please don't be one of those people that colonizes multiple pieces of equipment, and says I'm working there, I'm working there, and that can be quite a dance, and it can be hard to orchestrate a workout like that. So sometimes it will be starting off with a set of shoulder presses and then doing all your sets of those, and then moving to your chin ups and then perhaps back to shoulders and realizing, ah, someone's on the machine that I wanted or using the equipment that I wanted, so I'll just finish up the pulling. I'll finish up the back work and then going to the push. I don't obsess over the alternation in any kind of strict way. I really just try and get the muscles of the torso trained. And again, it's two exercises per muscle group, and one of those exercises is going to be something where there's, I realize this isn't physiologically accurate, but a shortening of the muscle or where they, at the end of the movement, the muscle is under maximal contraction. Like, throughout some names of exercises, just for purpose of understanding, so this would be, you know, like cable crossovers for the chest, the, the, the peak contraction is at the end, whereas something like an incline press, there's more of a stretch provided, it's done over a full range of motion at the beginning of the movement. So again, something where there's a stretch and something where there's a peak contraction for the shoulders, it's a little bit harder to do, although there are ways to do that, and Jeff Cavaliere has excellent workouts, available zero cost on YouTube, but also has excellent programs on his athlete next.com site, certainly has a lot of excellent protocols on his YouTube and Instagram, but on YouTube, you can put in his name, and any muscle group that you want to train to have some terrific videos describing exercise choice and other features of exercise parameters. Again, a peak contraction or shortening of the muscle, peak contraction exercise and a stretching exercise. And so for the back, one might say, okay, I seated row or a bent over row or a dumbbell row, where the elbow is brought behind the torso for a peak contraction movement, and then for more of a stretching movement, might be something like a chin up or a pull up. And as I say this, I understand that stretching and peak contraction aren't the exact terms that one would use if they were a physio therapist or a strength and conditioning coach, but I think for the typical person, who's trying to generate strength and hypertrophy in those muscles or maintain strength and hypertrophy in those muscles, this kind of nomenclature away describing it, at least should be clear and even efficient. And just to remind you, as with the leg workout, the total duration of the torso workout is going to be 50 to 60 minutes after a brief warmup, the sets and repetitions are going to be dictated in the same way that I described earlier, so for about a month it's going to be more sets, so anywhere from three to five sets in the lower repetition range, so forward to eight repetitions, so that's going to be heavier weights and longer rest as I described earlier, the rest intervals. And then for the next month it's going to be moderate repetitions, fewer sets the same way I described earlier. And if you want more details on all of that, you can find that in the newsletter related to the optimal or foundational fitness protocol that you can access at HupermanLap.com. One thing I should note about the Wednesday torso workout is that I am a big believer in training, the what I believe is the highly avoided or at least overlooked, but vitally important aspect of total body stability, strength and safety really safety, which is the neck. And I realize a lot of people don't want a large neck and I totally understand for aesthetic reasons why they don't want that. It's kind of interesting actually if you think about it that people have a large neck or often told they have no neck, they have no neck, people will say that guy is no neck or if no neck, when in fact they're referring to the fact that they have a very large neck. I don't know how that came to be. Someone who put in the comments why that is. How come when people have a big neck, they refer to it as no neck? So why do I train the neck? I train the neck for a couple of reasons. One is years ago I had an accident where I actually fell off a roof and I'd been training my neck at that time. For a sport that I was involved in and I walked away from it with a sore neck but not a broken neck and I thought, wow it's really great that I have been training my neck. In addition to that I was once in a car accident where I was parked just bought the car. It's my first in car purchase parked in that car with my mother and my grandfather in the back seat at the red light and someone rammed into us at full speed. Now fortunately none of us were hurt. We were all rattled. Once again I was very sore in my back and in my neck but I think one of the reasons why I was able to essentially walk away from that I didn't have any sustained damage was because I trained my neck. But I started training my neck for sport and I continued to train my neck because I noticed when I don't train my neck I started getting shoulder issues. And if you talk to an excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starret of the Ready State as an excellent channel. You can find them on all the social media and standard channels or you talk to anyone out there who really understands the strength of the torso and the upper body and even the back. What you learn is that of course being the upper portion of the spine stabilizing your neck is very important. Now training the neck can be a little bit detailed and specific and even dangerous if you do it wrong. Again Jeff Cavalier has a terrific set of videos on training the neck properly. And a lot of people out there might think neck bridges and I used to do neck bridges. I occasionally still sneak in a neck bridge here or there although I don't recommend it because in discussions with Jeff. He will tell you and it's true that the discs eventually go and you can run into serious issues from doing bridges and it doesn't happen gradually. So you can't notice it happening it just happens suddenly. So I might occasionally do a neck bridge but in general I'll train neck by wrapping a plate in a towel so that it won't end up with an imprint of the weight value on my head. Or face and then moving the neck from side to side or front or back and again we'll provide a link to those videos. It's a terrific set of videos that describe how to train your neck properly and safely. So even if you're not trying to grow your neck you definitely want to make sure that you use some light weight to make sure that your neck is stable and upright. I say stable and upright because it's very clear that for reasons related to texting and staring down at computers and related to weak neck relative to the rest of the muscles that that stabilize the spine. A lot of people, their default stance or their default posture is with chin forward and that's not good. Not only is it aesthetically not good but it also can create all sorts of issues related to back pain and headaches and things of that sort. This is a real thing training your neck allows you to stand upright sit upright. I even believe that it allows you to do things like public speaking or have conversations with people on the street in a way where you are front facing as opposed to looking down. So Wednesday is torso and neck and then comes Thursday and that means another cardiovascular exercise session. Although it's a brief one. Unlike the endurance training on Sunday, the cardiovascular session on Thursday and again for me it falls on Thursday but for you it could fall on a different day depending on when you started this protocol. It's going to be about again about 35 minutes of for me running although it could be rolling or it could be cycling it could be something that sort. The goal of this workout is what's important. The goal of this workout is to tap into, remember that long list that we talked about earlier where you've got skill and speed and power and strength and hypertrophy etc. Different forms of endurance is to get into that range of endurance where your heart rate is elevated quite a bit more than zone two. But you're not really going all out sprint. So what that means for me is warming up for about five to ten minutes that could be jogging a little bit of light calisthenics might even be hopping on a stationary bike although to be as I load the stationary bike. And then setting a timer and doing about 30 but ideally 35 minutes of what I call 75 to 80 percent of all out. Okay now I realize this spits in the face of all you heart rate monitor wearing super techie exercise types but when I think of all out sprint I think of 100 percent and what is that in my mind that's somebody is chasing me with a needle full of poison and I am sprinting away at maximal speed that for me is 100 percent. So after a brief warm up what I'm going to do is go out typically outside although sometimes it has to be on a treadmill if I'm traveling and move run for about 30 to 35 minutes at about 75 or 80 percent of that all out. What that means is that I'm striving to keep a steady pace but in reality I don't. I sometimes have to stop at a stop light there are cars please don't run into traffic just to maintain that speed and that timing that would be terribly antagonistic to fitness and particular life span. That running tends to be running in which I'm breathing hard so I'm not able to restrict myself to purely nasal breathing and I should have mentioned earlier on the Sunday. Long rock or weighted hike or jog if I'm alone I try and do pure nasal breathing if I'm with other people or I'm talking obviously I'm not going to do pure nasal breathing because I'm talking although I. Sure that sometimes they wish I was doing pure nasal breathing that Thursday work out accomplishes a number of things first of all it really gets my heart rate up and it improves multiple aspects of endurance because as you recall earlier the different bins of endurance that include muscular endurance anaerobic that three to twelve minute range and then 30 minutes are longer none of them really precisely match what's accomplished in this 35 minute or so cardiovascular session where I'm pushing hard but not all out. But that's exactly the reason to do it which is that it taps into multiple fuel systems for the muscle and multiple aspects of. The heart and capillary is an arteries and veins that are involved in generating that movement so it really cuts a broad swath into multiple categories of endurance and also just keep in mind what this foundational or optimal fitness protocol is really designed to do. In my mind a foundational fitness protocol is one that leaves you or has you in a state where if you need to walk really far and carry a bunch of weight you can do it. If you need to lift a heavy object with your legs you can do it if you need to run really fast for two minutes you can do it and if you need to. Run a little bit further like maybe in ten minutes for whatever reason you can do that so it's a really kind of all around fitness program and that 35 minute run again could be swap with a 35 minute or grow or sometimes if you only have access to a stationary bike you could do that. I suppose if you didn't have access to any equipment and running is not your thing. One thing that I have done especially if I've been stuck in a hotel because I arrived late someplace and I really want to get this workout in. You could do the dreaded burpee I know there's a lot of opinions out there some people in burpees are downright dangerous other people love burpees you could do that. Or you could do really fast but full jumping jacks I know that's a little. P.E. class right physical education class ish but sometimes if I need to get the workout in what I'll do in a hotel if I've arrived late. In particular day of travel is I will find the stairwell the fire stairwell I'll make sure by the way that I can get back into the building because I've been locked in those stairwells before. And I will simply walk really fast up the stairwell as many flights of stairs as there are or maybe even jog it not quite sprint but I'll run up those stairs over and over and over again in order to get that 35 minutes of 75 to 80% of max output cardiovascular worked on and if I'm really just restricted to my hotel room I'll just do jumping jacks for 30 35 minutes sometimes while watching something on TV and believe me if you're doing full jumping jacks like really extending your legs really getting arms overhead and really doing the full movement. By the time you hit five or six minutes you are going to be sweating and you are your heart rate is really going to be up. I also sometimes will travel with a jump rope I always try and travel with a jump rope and skip rope. Much of the dismay of the people who are housed below me in the hotel room. Skipping rope I should mention can be a very effective way of getting cardiovascular training while you're on the road but in all seriousness if you're in a hotel room or an apartment and you can't really jump high and you're very good at jumping rope what you'll find is it's not going to get you into that higher elevated heart rate zone. It can be great for zone two type training but if you're really good at skipping rope and I wouldn't say I'm really good at it but I've done enough skipping rope that I can just kind of cruise and talk and it's more zone twoish even feels like walking at times. Now you can do double unders where you're really jumping and putting the rope under your twice each time or cross overs etc depending on your skill level. But again if you're in an apartment and you're in a hotel that's going to be harder to do and because of there's some skill involved sometimes you're stopping more often than you're continuing. By the way, and I just have to mention this a really terrific Instagram channel is Anna Skips. This is a teacher a science teacher or I believe it's a math math as they say in the UK because she's in the UK. Math's teacher I don't know Anna but I know she skips because she has this amazing Instagram channel called Anna Skips and what's really cool about her Instagram is she shows you her progression from not being able to skip rope at all to the absolutely incredible types of. Rope skipping that she's doing each morning while getting sunlight, which of course is a essential health protocol. So check out Anna Skips on Instagram really inspiring and make me want to get better at skipping rope I'm still working at it. OK, so with that Thursday Cardiovascular. Let's call it endurance but Cardiovascular training work out done around rolls Friday and on Friday I'm going to do another Cardiovascular training session and I alluded to this earlier but this Cardiovascular training session is also designed. to tap into some of the ability of hard, I should say high-intensity interval training, to tap into strength and hypertrophy increases for the legs. Because remember, we train legs on Monday. And what the science tells us is that protein synthesis in a muscle group can be stimulated about every 42 to 72 hours. And so we've had Tuesday, off, Wednesday off, and Thursday off. And you don't want to lose progress that you made from that terrific Monday leg workout. But in order to make sure that you can do the other things that follow in this program and pick back up on Monday with another leg workout, at least for me with my recovery abilities and my work schedule, I'm not going to do an entire other leg workout because it's going to set the whole thing out of whack. That is, I won't be able to consistently do the same workouts on the same days of each week. Now, with that said, a little bit later, I'll explain what happens if you have to miss a workout and how you can combine days, et cetera. But I really strive to get certain workouts done on certain days consistently, at least as best I can. So Friday is high-intensity interval training. And that can take a variety of different forms. For me, the ideal thing to do for me, again, you could do something completely different, exercise choice, again, should be governed by what you can do safely so you don't injure yourself and that you can perform effectively and that gets you or provides you the stimulus that you want and what I'm trying to do on Friday is get my heart rate way, way up. Talk about this in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin. In addition to the benefits of getting 180 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week minimum, it's a really good idea to get up to that max or near max heart rate at least once a week. And you're not going to do that for very long periods of time. You're not going to do that for 30 minutes. You can't sprint all out for 30 minutes unless you're Steve Prefontein. You haven't seen the movies without limits or Prefontein. You should absolutely see those. He was able to go out and run 12 laps. What seemed to be an all out sprint or close to it. Incredible. But most people are not going to do that or are going to be carried away on a stretcher if they try. These high-intensity interval training for me, ideally, would be on so-called assault bike or air-dine bike. So these are bikes that have the fan, which might seem like, oh, you know, just cool as you off. But actually, there's a lot of resistance there. So what I will typically do is a 20 to 30 second all out sprint using arms and legs and then 10 seconds rest and then repeat all out sprint for 20 to 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. And I'll do that for anywhere from eight to 12 rounds, which trust me, even if you start out a little bit less or I should say not all out intensity or effort. By the time you hit the fifth or sixth one, you will be certainly headed into, if not a near your maximum heart rate. Now, what is your maximum heart rate? Do you need a heart rate monitor? No, if you'd like using that sort of thing great. But again, Andy Albin, beautifully supplied us with the information. He said, if you take the number 220 and you subtract your age, that for most people, most is going to be your maximum heart rate. Although for certain people who are very fit or certain ages, that's not going to apply. So it's a little bit too crude to measure, but it's a good starting place and you can look up other information or see that podcast episode. We probably don't link to it in the show note captions. If you want to get more details on that, I don't use a heart rate monitor. What I'm trying to do is get to that point where I quote unquote, feel like I want to die. Now, I don't want to die and please don't die. Right? If you're not in good cardiovascular health, do not just jump right into this fitness protocol. But I want to get to the point where I really feel like I could not pedal any faster or pull any faster on the assault bike, the airtime bike, or if I'm doing this workout in a place or at a time, or because I choose to not use a bike or a roller, because you could also use a roller, I will simply do sprint jog intervals. I will sprint for 20 or 30 seconds, then jog for 10 seconds. Sprint for 20 or 30 seconds, and then jog for 10 seconds and just repeat. I used to have a big field next to my laboratory, my old laboratory, and I used to bring my bulldog Costello out there. He was really good at the first sprint part and then he would just lie down and watch. He didn't even do the jog part. I would just go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, panting like a bulldog, nonstop, barely able to recover before sprinting again. And the basis of this workout again is several whole first of all, it's to get the heart rate really high up towards maximum heart rate at least once a week. So you accomplish that this Friday. Also, if you are sprinting and then jogging or you are really pushing hard on an assault bike or an air-dine bike, or using a, for instance, a skier or the skier machine, or any number of different cardiovascular training tools, you are going to get activation of the legs. Of course, not to the same degree as you would with squats or deadlifter leg extensions and leg curls. That's simply not the case. But you're going to trigger strength and hypertrophy and other types of adaptations in those muscle groups. So this for me also represents the second leg workout of the week where I'm not touching any weights. One important point that I don't think I've heard mention anywhere else, but that I hope to have Dr. Kelly Starret on the podcast to discuss and that I've discussed with him one on one, which is be careful with all out sprints or all out anything cardiovascular exercise. You can get injured doing those. So for instance, if you go out and you just sprint across a field all out 20 or 30 seconds and then walk back and can do it again and again, don't be surprised if the next day you have some sciatica or even some pelvic floor pain. I don't recommend going all out on any movement that you can't perform with perfect form. So for me, I really try and stay away from all out sprints. I'll sprint it about 95% of what I can do because I find if I go all out sprint, I don't know what the reason is, but it might be an over extension of a limb or something like that. I'm not a sprinter. I'm not a sprinting coach. I do hope to get Stu McMillan on here, or Dan Fath, who are excellent sprinting coaches. At some point, they're world class sprinting coaches, but I'm not a pro sprinter. I'm not even a amateur sprinter. I'm a fitness sprinter. So the airdiner assault bike or the roar is really a safer option for me. And if I'm running or I'm doing some sort of movement where I'm unconstrained, really in terms of how far my stride is. I mean, I'm obviously constrained by the musculature. I'm really careful to not overextend or do something like that. And the only way to do that is to not go all out. So again, the goal for this Friday workout is to really get the heart rate high, do high-intensity interval training. Her number of different ways you could do that. You can look up HIIT, hit workouts online, find the one that's best for you, and really pick something that's safe that you can do consistently. And I believe that ideally will also trigger a bit of either strength and high-perchirpheat and speed power maintenance, or even give you a little bit of a stimulus so that by time you roll around to that leg workout on again on Monday, you've got a little bit of an additional boost to your leg strength, hypertrophy, speed, and power. So we've covered Sunday through Friday, and then Saturday rolls around, and Saturday is when you train arms, calves, and neck. So this may sound as if you're training a bunch of small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks, and calves, and that's true. But I should mention that you are also training your torso a second time, and you're doing it indirectly, or sometimes not it indirectly. Why do I say this? Well, keep in mind, again, that for strength and hypertrophy, you're going for that once about every 48 to 72 hours, you want to stimulate that on Wednesday as when you train your torso, right? Chest shoulders back and neck. You've had Thursday to rest, Friday to rest. I know a lot of people are going to want to emphasize those body parts that are gonna go out. You have to train it twice a week, but if you have modest recovery ability, or low recovery ability, such as I do, and you're doing these other cardiovascular training sessions et cetera, well then on Saturday is when you will train arms, calves, and neck directly, but included in that. Remember, two exercises per muscle group, one with a peak contraction, one with somewhat of a stretch in there, included in that, I suggest doing some sort of dip movement, which I think it was pavalset solence at the dip is synonymous with, or at least similar to an upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavall, if I got that wrong, maybe it wasn't you that said that, but big admire of his work. And certainly the dip is a great exercise to hit multiple muscle groups, it just shoulders and triceps. Maybe even some back to some extent, depending on how you do it. So doing some dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, in the chest and shoulders, and including some sort of pulling movement for the bicep, like a chin up or palms facing, movement pulling up to the bar, especially if it's a close grip type movement, but even if it's a wide grip type movement, will of course trigger strength and hypertrophy maintenance or improvements in the biceps, but will also trigger strength hypertrophy in the lats, in the back. Okay, so Saturday is this arm workout, with that, I'll just give an example of a potential workout where you might do a few more exercises, and maybe not just two, but maybe three to make sure we get the torso indirect stimulation. So what would this look like? Well, this might be your sort of classic dumbbell curls for the bicep, and maybe incline curl for the bicep, because it has more of a stretch, so on an incline bench. And then you might finish with two sets of chin ups, so palms facing you, chin ups or three sets of chin ups, depending on whether or not you're in a heavier load month or a more moderate weight month. Again, activating the biceps muscles, arms day, but also activating strength and hypertrophy in the lats, or at least maintaining it. So that because you're not training those torso muscles again until Wednesday, you're not allowing the hypertrophy and strength gains that you generated on Wednesday to atrophy to disappear. Then thinking about triceps, it might be some sort of triceps isolation or peak contraction movement, so that could be triceps kickback, or it's some overhead extension, it would be more of a stretch type movement, than a kickback, but then also doing regular old dips. You might even start with dips, which again are going to activate those torso muscles and the triceps. And then calf work in the same way that you did on Monday, and neck work, again, I am a believer in training neck multiple times per week. And if you are able to finish all of that in 45 or 50 minutes, great, most people will find when you're doing a lot of small muscle groups actually takes longer, because you have to go around to more exercises. But again, just to adhere to the same principles we talked about before, about 50, 50, or 60 minutes of real work after a warm-up, with an asterisk next to that, that if someone's on the equipment or you can't find the dumbbells you need, et cetera, then maybe 75 minutes max. But really trying to not extend that workout too long, making sure that you activate the arms directly, but also activating the torso muscles indirectly. And again, I won't repeat it this time again, but following the same weight and repetition and rest interval scheme that we talked about earlier, a bit heavier, lower reps, more sets, and longer rest for about a month, and then alternating two, more repetitions, yet fewer sets, shorter rest intervals, and do that for about a month. This carries through for all the resistance training workouts regardless of the day of the week. So we've completed the total arc across the week, and we can summarize it as saying, Sunday is, let's just say, long endurance, Monday is leg resistance training, Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, I would call it moderate intensity, cardiovascular exercise, so that 35 minute, moderate intensity, cardiovascular exercise, Friday high intensity interval training, of sprinting or some variation thereof, and Saturday, arms calves neck, and torso indirect work. That's the total structure, but I want to emphasize again, you do not need to start this on Sunday. That is, you could make the long endurance work start on Tuesday, and then just fill in the rest as described before. It's really up to you. There's another important point I want to make, which is that neither I nor anyone is going to be successful in doing the exact workouts on the exact same days of every week, because of travel, work, illness, other demands, et cetera. The thing about the schedule that I like so much that I do believe that will benefit you as well is that you have some flexibility there. What's the flexibility? Well, let's say you train your typical Sunday work out of endurance, and you train legs on Monday, and then you don't manage to do your heat cold contrast on Tuesday for whatever reason. Well, you can put it on Wednesday, just make sure that if you're going to do the cold stimulus that you don't do it too close, not within four ideally eight hours after the training of torso, but you could do it before, or you could do it just heat and skip the cold that particular week, right? Not ideal, but better than not doing anything. Let's say for instance, the leg workout was particularly brutal. You don't sleep that well on Monday night or Tuesday night. Well, then should you do the torso workout on Wednesday? Well, I would say, why not move the heat cold contrast in Wednesday and then push that torso workout to Thursday? And maybe also trying to do that 35 minute run on Thursday. Every once in a while, rather than lose the total control of the program and let everything shuffle forward. Here's the basic principle. I do believe that any one of these workouts, whether it's for endurance or resistance training, can be shifted either one day forward or one day back, right? You could delay it by a day or you could accelerate it by a day in order to make sure that you get everything done across the week. In fact, I would say the best way to think about this foundational fitness program is not from the details up, but from the top down, from the big picture down to the details. And say to yourself, once a week, you're going to get some long endurance in. Another day during the week, you're going to make sure that you get a kind of moderate, faster endurance workout in. And then one other day, during the week, you're going to get an all-out sprint high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. You're going to get those three workouts in somehow. And then in addition to that, you will also do resistance training for every muscle group in your body. And that means doing your legs hard at least once a week. Your torso hard at least once a week. And your arms hard at least once a week. And of course, you are also paying attention to train your calves. And I do, for reasons I described before, I believe that you want to train your neck, at least to keep it strong. You may not want to generate hypertrophy there. People vary in terms of how quickly their neck grows. Some people goes very, very fast. Other people for the life of them, they can't get much hypertrophy in their neck. But keeping that neck strong, at least through some very light work to moderate, weight work, very, very important for reasons I stated earlier. If you set out those goals, then the specific days that you do each workout isn't as critical, but the specific spacing is. So for instance, you're not going to want to do your high-intensity interval training the day after you train your legs. Because if you're doing the high-intensity interval training correctly, you're going to be taxing your legs and eating into their recovery. And so you want to space them out by two or three days. So I think you'll notice that the point is really to optimize everything on the whole rather than any one specific aspect of training or adaptation. Now that said, I do realize that some people might be hyper-focused on things like strength and hypertrophy and the aesthetics that come with it. A key point about strength hypertrophy and weight training. And this is something that was been covered on multiple podcasts. Certainly the one with Jeff Cavaliere and with Dr. Andy Galpin and the one that I did on building muscle strength and hypertrophy, the solo episode. And that is the following. It is the rare individual who has perfectly balanced musculature. Most people can be a bit quad dominant or hamstring dominant or they have a trouble activating their glutes or somebody has a terrible time trying to activate their chest muscles, but they're very strong in the back, et cetera. It's very clear that we can know that, not just based on aesthetics, but based on deliberate contractability of those muscles. So I don't want to get into this in too much detail for sake of time, but this is something that has peer reviewed research to support it and was also discussed extensively with Jeff Cavaliere when he was a guest. And that actually he's really popularized this notion and it's absolutely true, which is that if you can contract a muscle very hard to the point where it almost feels like it's cramping, if you can do that even when there's no weight in your hand or there's no resistance against it. So you're just using your mind muscle connection to contract that muscle hard and isolate it. Chances are you will be able to generate hypertrophy and strength gains pretty easily in that muscle compared to muscles that you have a harder time activating. So during all resistance training that mind muscle link is really important. So much so that some people will even try and emphasize contraction and the muscles in between sets, et cetera. I personally because I'm not somebody who likes a mirror when I work out and I'm not somebody who wants to spend time in between sets flexing muscles and et cetera. For whatever reason I want to actually rest between sets and I'm more concerned with performance during those sets and really putting my mind into the muscle during the set. I really try and emphasize deep relaxation between sets. And so here's a tool that again is built out of science and I should say peer reviewed studies, some of which are being done in my lab, but other labs as well, which is that in between sets, what I really strive to do is to bring my heart rate down as much as possible, call myself down as much as possible. And I'll do the so-called physiological sign in order to do that. That's two inales through the nose, back to back. And then long full exhale through the mouth. I just did it partially there for a sake of time again. So a big deep inhale through the nose and then sneak in a little bit more on a second inhale to maximally inflate the lungs and the ovule, the lungs and then a full exhale of all your air via the mouth to empty your lungs. That's the fastest way that we are aware of to calm your nervous system down and really in between sets. You can use that to calm yourself down and conserve energy, but then as you move into the weight training set, you really want to ratchet up your focus and attention to the muscles that you're going to be using. Now I'd like to acknowledge that there's a huge range of parameters in terms of how to actually perform during the set. You can focus on a particular muscle and try and isolate it from the beginning of the movement. Some people will really try and isolate it only during the peak contraction. Some people will accentuate the negative, their speed and cadence. There are again, remember, concepts are few. Methods are many and if you're interested in the various methods of e-centric and concentrics and all the different ways of changing up cadence and so forth during set. There's an enormous amount of quality information out there far too much for us to get into detail. Now, but what I described that general principles of how to set your mind if you will during the set, you should be focused on the muscles that you're using and or moving the weight. If movement of the weight is more important, you can either focus on moving the weight or challenging muscles. You can either try and isolate muscles and make specific muscles to the work or simply moving the weight. Moving the weight is going to be more geared towards strength improvements. But focusing on the muscle is also called my muscle link. It's going to shift that very same set more toward hypertrophy. I realize I'm painting with a broad brush here, but nonetheless, this is grounded in the way that the nervous system governs muscular contraction. And while I think most people are familiar with the number of different variables associated with resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, etc. There are also a tremendous number of very important variables for endurance and any kind of cardiovascular training. And there are a lot of excellent resources out there about that. I think the most important one, in fact, I will go on record saying what I believe to be the most important variable for any endurance or cardiovascular training is that because it's a repetitive movement that you are able to complete the movement safely, meaning you're not putting your body into range of motion or into positions that can damage joints or put you in any kind of compromise state. And some of you might think, well, that seems kind of silly. But if you've ever set the for instance, the seat too high on a stationary bike and then you know, air dine or assault bike type interval training sprints, if it's set too high and you're overstriding as it were, the next day you can really pay the price in terms of some back pain or sciatica and sometimes that pain can extend for quite a while. So of course, you don't want to approach any exercise with so much caution that it's neurotic and preventive. And yet you don't want to approach any exercise in any way that's so cavalier, forgive the pun Jeff, that you're also going to compromise your the integrity of your joints and musculature and connective tissue. Let's talk about some real world practical variables. For instance, let's say you get a poor to terrible night sleep. Should you train the next day or not? Well that really depends. I can honestly say I've had some of the best training sessions, resistance training or endurance training sessions after a really poor night sleep. But that's the rare event. More often than not, if I'm not sleeping well, if I had a terrible night sleep the next day, I will just skip training that day. I know that will shock a number of you out there or perhaps you're already calling me names, weak, et cetera. But I find that if I've slept really poorly or I've had a very stressful event the day before and I don't sleep well, training the next day sets me up for getting ill and getting ill sets me up for not being able to train for multiple days. So it is my preference in that case to skip a day and really focus on recovery. And then as I mentioned earlier, slide that workout to the next day and rarely double that workout up with another workout, but then just slide the schedule forward by a day. But I really try and strive that is I really try to double up at least some workouts later in the week in that case so that I can get back on schedule of starting the seven day protocol again on the same day. I don't want to be excessively vague there. What I'm trying to say is I try and adhere to the same schedule, but if I get a poor night sleep, I'll just simply skip the workout the next day, slide the workout forward. There is one exception to that and it's an important exception which is there are times when I've not slept well or I've had some particularly stressful event the day before and haven't slept well. But I'm able to do so-called NSTR non-sleep deep rest the next day. So there have been times when I've only got three or four hours of sleep the night before and I'm feeling really behind the ball the next morning. But I really want to get my workout in so instead what I will do is a 10 but ideally in that case a 30 or even 60 minute it's non-sleep deep rest and there's a 10 minute non-sleep deep rest protocol read by me but it is a non-spiritual non-mistical science supported non-sleep deep rest protocol available on YouTube. You can simply put my name, Huberman, put NSTR and VirtuSan, VIRTUSAN into YouTube and you'll find that script. There are other NSTR scripts that you can find now on Spotify and on YouTube and if you fall asleep during those non-sleep deep rest scripts that's great and if you don't you will also find that it will restore your ability to perform mental and physical work. So there are times when I haven't got as much sleep as I would like or I'm feeling a bit more stressed for whatever reason and I'll do NSTR and then I will go train and that often works fabulously well for me and then I don't have to skip a workout entirely just because I didn't get it good night's sleep. A lot of people ask whether or not you should train fasted or fed and this is a very controversial area. I personally prefer to do my cardiovascular work not having eaten anything in the previous three to 10 hours and typically that's because I wake up and I'll do the cardiovascular training within about an hour of waking up. Sometimes later because my first meal generally falls generally not always falls around 11 a.m. I don't do any kind of formal intermittent fasting but typically my meal schedule somewhere between 11 a.m. and my last bite of food is around 8 p.m. but I'm not super strict about that. I might eat in, you know, as late as 9 p.m. and I might eat something at 10 a.m. if I wake up really hungry I might have something before 11 a.m. I'm not neurotic about it. But in terms of training I like to train fasted and that includes the resistance training workouts and those come early in the day for me and typically if I'm going to train legs on Monday for instance, which is when I train legs, I'll make sure that the night before I'm adjusting some starch, some carbohydrate, rice or pasta or something in that sort to make sure that when I do that morning leg workout I have enough glycogen in the muscles etc. Again nutrition is a somewhat controversial area. In fact it can evoke very strong feelings because I know we've got vegans and we've got omnivores and we've got carnivores and people who are keto. This isn't really the format for us to get into all of that. I think the rule to follow is figure out what optimizes your training for your particular training goals. For me that most often means training fasted and then eating pretty soon after I train and if it's a high intensity resistance training workout and frankly all my resistance training workouts are pretty high intensity. I'm not going to failure on every set but at least about 30% of those sets I'm going to failure and the other sets I'm working very hard nonetheless. Well then I eat some starches after I train and I also ingest some protein in the form of protein drink or a meal that includes some protein food. But I don't like to eat before I do resistance training or not or at least not within the hour or two before I do resistance training. There are exceptions to that and I should say that the same basically applies to endurance work if I'm going to head out for a run to be glad I don't want my belly full of food or any food at all but there are times where I wake up hungry and I very much need to eat something or I have something scheduled socially like a breakfast and I'll have that breakfast and then an hour or 90 minutes later I'll do my workout because I want to make sure that I finish the workout. I again am not neurotically attached to training fasted or fed for me fasted is preferred but if I have to train fed better to train than to not train at all. We haven't talked so much about flexibility yet but we did an entire episode of the Human-MindLab podcast on flexibility and I encourage you to check out that episode if you're interested in increasing your flexibility but the basic takeaway from that episode is that if you look at what I like to call the center of mass of the research that is most of the studies and what the conclusions of most of the quality studies point to so not the exceptions but the kind of general rules that have been gleaned over time from multiple labs over multiple decades etc. What you find is that static stretching that is holding a stretch and in fact exhaling and relaxing the midsection in torso and relaxing into the stretch as opposed to staying full of air and tense but mentally and physically relaxing into the stretch but not stretching maximally that is not extending as far as you possibly can go but more like 60% or even less and then holding those static stretches for anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds and then repeating doing that two or three times throughout the week for multiple muscle groups so it could be for quadriceps, could be hamstrings for your lats, their protocols out there in fact we have a newsletter that is focused entirely on protocols for flexibility and stretching you can find that again by going humanmolev.com you don't even need to sign up for the newsletter although we invite you to if you like but you can simply go there scroll down to the flexibility newsletter and all the protocols are there for each of the muscle groups etc but what I typically try and do is some stretching in the evening because I train in the morning as I'm perhaps getting ready for bed or if the TV is on which in our house doesn't typically go on because we don't have a TV but of course there are computers and you know people are on their computers etc well I'll try and do some stretching while I do that I also have a standing desk so during the day at work regardless of whether or not I train that morning or not or I'm going to train in the afternoon I'll try and do some static stretching for my hamstrings my quads my lats my shoulders my back really doesn't take much time and I really try and space that out throughout the week which if you look at the peer reviewed research matches well to what's known to be most effective which are going to be short repeated sessions ideally every day but truth told I fail I categorically fail I was about to think whether or not I ever stretch every day I failed to do it every day but I get about three or so stretching sessions in per week and again it's just static hold trying to really relax into the stretch now the relax into the stretch is something has been talked about in martial arts circles and pavalsat sullen has an excellent book on stretching we can provide a link to that talks about this has a lot to do with relaxation of the nervous system and the way that the nerves intervate muscles and allow for stretch if you will also the way that the tendons and ligaments are are intervated by nerves the converse is also true and here again this is a principle that pavals put forth I believe he calls it irradiation meaning irradiating out or emanating out from a source which is that while exhaling and relaxing the torso the midsection some people call it the core although some people don't like that term can facilitate relaxation and stretching through a larger range of so to can contracting the core the midsection or gripping very tightly with the fist can facilitate muscular contraction because of the way that the nervous system heavily we can even say over represents the fists in the brain and so how would you apply this to your overall foundational fitness protocol well it turns out that let's say you're doing movement that involves one limb moving and then the other let's say it's bicep curls just for sake of example it turns out that you will actually be stronger in moving that dumbbell with the arm that happens to be moving if you grip the handle very tightly but also grip the handle of the opposite dumbbell very tightly now that said in between sets I encourage you to do the opposite to trying completely relax in between sets combine that with the physiological side and then when the set the next set commences employ that very strong grip both again of the of the weight that's moving in the and the weight that at that moment might be stationary or an isometric position so the nervous system of course is what controls muscles and that operates in both directions if you want to relax trying to use long exhales maybe you're in physiological size and really concentrate on mentally and physically relaxing in particular your core and your fists and if you want to generate force right you want to move a heavy barbell or dumbbell you want to do a chin up with the maximal force that's when you can employ the opposite which would be to grip the bar or dumbbell etc very tightly and you want to contract your core even fill your body with air as they say plug all the leaks etc so this gets into kind of form and movement which is an extensive near infinite landscape of discussion again that we don't have time to go into just want to mention those two nervous system related tips because I suppose is a neuroscientist they appeal to me because they are grounded in fundamental principles of how the nervous system interacts muscle and I know that they will benefit you the first time you use them and every time speaking of grip and nervous system in fitness and longevity doctor Peter atia who is a medical doctor was a guest on the human lab podcast and provided an enormous wealth of information on that podcast episode I really encourage you to check it out when you have time and of course has his own spectacular podcast the drive with Peter atia Peter doctor atia should say often talks about certain movements where exercises that you should perform not just to improve your fitness but also to touch into or measure how fit you are and how well you are progressing toward a long lifespan and health span and one of those includes the ability to hang from a bar for a minute or longer and there are a number of different expectations that one can have of how long they should be able to hang from a bar depending on their age and their fitness level etc. please check out Dr. Atia's podcast and his various social media sites to get more information on that but what I can tell you is that if you're going to hang from a bar and you want to hang from that bar as long as possible which turns out to be a interesting and important metric of your health then gripping the bar very tightly will actually help. Earlier we talked about whether or not to train if you're sleep deprived and how to recover from what I would say is moderate sleep deprivation by doing NSDR as opposed to total sleep deprivation like being up all night or having a truly miserable night which case I think you should just skip training the next day and slide it forward. Now a similar issue comes up from time to time where people wonder whether or not they should train or not if they are sick and here there's all sorts of crazy gym lore and sport specific lore for instance I used to hear this when I ran cross-country there was this adage that if the symptoms were from the neck up you could still train that is if you were really congested and you had a headache you could still run whereas if it was in your chest and your lungs you couldn't run. I don't think there's any data whatsoever to support whether or not that's true or whether it's not true for myself and because my general goal is to be training and fit over time but also to include general health in the fitness equation that is to not be sick or chronically sick and certainly not to get other people sick. If I have a little tiny sniffle I think I might be getting sick even then I'm a little cautious in the sense that I'm not going to do my typical workout. I might stop it about 15 minutes earlier and I would do that not by neglecting anybody parts or anything of that sort if it's a weight training workout by simply reducing the total number of sets. I probably wouldn't do any sets to failure if I did. I might reduce the total number or percentage of sets to failure from about 30% of sets to maybe closer to 10% of sets something like that and if it was endurance work I might throttle back by 10 or 20% and I was short in the total duration of the workout and I often find that because of the known yes peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects of exercise sometimes that alone will allow me to avoid getting sick but of course I'm also careful to get home take a hot shower not stress myself out if I can avoid getting myself stressed out and focus on sleep and STR other forms of recovery good nutrition etc. If however I have a real sniffle a cold I'm not feeling well or I think I might be coming down with a flu I absolutely do not train and I don't get back into training of any kind until I'm completely recovered. So what I'm basically saying is that no I don't believe you should train if you're sick and perhaps equally importantly when you come back from a layoff of any kind whether or not because of illness or for whatever reason I do believe that because your body is a bit untrained it's not ideal to jump right back into maximal training and to take one maybe two weeks of ramping up to the full duration and intensity of workouts that then I would continue on going for however many cycles I can complete before I hit another sickness or I hit another gap in my schedule due to family obligations or other obligations etc. So we've covered a lot of tools and protocols and variables related to fitness but we have by no means covered all the available tools and protocols and variables. Before we wrap up I do want to emphasize one tool it's a very easy in fact zero cost very low time commitment tool and this was one that was provided again by Dr. Andy Galpin when he was on the Human Lab podcast and it's a tool that there is excellent research to support the effectiveness of and that I do believe should come at the end of every training session and that's to do three to five minutes of deliberately slow breathing it sounds so simple three to five minutes of deliberately slowed breathing so this could be while you're in the shower or when you arrive at your car you might sit in your car quietly and do that if you have time or maybe even while you're driving back to or onto your next destination just to really slow down your breathing to really look at the recovery period that has to follow each training session and of course during which the adaptations the changes that make you more fit than you were going into the exercise occur and that three to five minutes of deliberately slowed breathing has been shown in Andy's group and in related experiments not exactly the same but related experiments in our laboratory and in other laboratories to really so-called downshift the nervous system and really set you up for maximal recovery rapid recovery and allow you to lean into the next training session with full intensity when that training session eventually arrives so it's a very simple tool but a very potent tool for your overall fitness so thank you for joining me for this discussion of what I'm calling a foundational yes we could even get bold and call it an optimal fitness protocol though the word optimal is a tricky one there's no real optimal fitness protocol and today what I really try to focus on is this foundational protocol because it does allow you to check off most if not all the boxes related to strength endurance hypertrophy speed power flexibility will also teach you how to regulate your nervous system up and down that is to ramp up and focus mind muscle link etc and then quickly calm down physiological size three to five minute decompress breathing at the end of training etc really even though I talked about the protocol that I follow and again that we will provide as a newsletter at hubermanlab.com if you want to look at it in more detail even though we talked about it in the context of what I do again I really want to emphasize that this protocol and the description of this protocol and all its variables is really for you and for you to tailor to your specific needs so please take the protocol into consideration but do not treat it as holy treated as a starting point from which you can adapt it to your specific fitness needs.

vid00009," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast where we discuss science, science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Heuberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and off-the-mology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today my guest is Dr. Peter Atia. Dr. Atia's a physician who's focused on nutritional supplementation based behavioral prescription drug and other interventions that promote health span and lifespan. His expertise spans from exercise physiology to sleep physiology, emotional and mental health, and pharmacology. Today we talk about all those areas of health, starting with the very basics such as how to evaluate one's own health status and how to define one's health trajectory. We also talk about the various sorts of interventions that one can take in order to optimize vitality while also extending longevity that is lifespan. Dr. Atia's uniquely qualified to focus on the complete depth and breadth of topics that we cover. Indeed, these are the same topics that he works with his patients on in his clinic every day. Dr. Atia earned his bachelor of science in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics and his MD from Stanford University School of Medicine. He then went on to train at Johns Hopkins Hospital in general surgery, one of the premier hospitals in the world, where he was the recipient of several prestigious awards, including resident of the year. He's been an author on comprehensive reuse of general surgery. He spent two years at the National Institutes of Health, as a surgical oncology fellow at the National Cancer Institute, where his work focused on immune-based therapies for melanoma. In the fields of science and medicine, it is well understood that we are much the product of our mentors and the mentoring we receive. Dr. Atia has trained with some of the best and most innovative lipidologists, endocrinologists, gynecologists, sleep physiologists, and longevity scientists in the United States and Canada. So, the expertise that funnels through him and that he shares with us today is really harnessed from the best of the best and his extensive training and expertise. By the end of today's episode, you will have answers to important basic questions such as, should you have blood work? How often should you do blood work? What specific things should you be looking for on that blood work that are either counterintuitive or not often discussed? And yet, that immediately and in the long-term influence your lifespan and health span, we talk about hormone health and hormone therapies for both men and women. We talk about drug therapies that can influence the mind as well as the body. And of course, we talk about supplementation, nutrition, exercise and predictors of lifespan and health span. It is an episode rich with information. For some of you, you may want to get out a pen and paper in order to take notes for others of you that learn better simply by listening to it. Just want to remind you that we have time stamped all this information so that you can go back to the specific topics most of interest to you. I'm pleased to announce that the human and lab podcast is now partnered with momentous supplements. We partnered with momentous for several important reasons. First of all, they ship internationally because we know that many of you are located outside of the United States. Second of all, and perhaps most important, the quality of their supplements is second to none, both in terms of purity and precision of the amounts of the ingredients. Third, we really emphasize supplements that are single ingredient supplements and that are supplied in dosages that allow you to build a supplementation protocol that's optimized for cost, that's optimized for effectiveness and that you can add things and remove things from your protocol in a way that's really systematic and scientific. If you'd like to see the supplements that we've partnered with momentous on, you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman. There you'll see those supplements and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding the library of supplements available through momentous on a regular basis. Again, that's libmomentous.com slash Huberman. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes custom neutropics that are designed for your unique needs. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the word neutropics because neutropics means smart drugs. And to be honest, there is no such thing as a smart drug because there's no neural circuit for being smart. There are neural circuits rather for being creative or for task switching or for focus. And as we all know, different sorts of demands, whether or not they are cognitive or physical, required different types of cognitive and physical abilities. Thesis understands this and has created a kit of custom neutropics that are tailored to your needs. To get your own personalizing tropic starter kit, you can go to takethesis.com slash Huberman. Take their three-minute quiz and Thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month. That's takethesis.com slash Huberman and use the code Huberman. Check out to get 10% off your first box of custom neutropics. Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood worked on. For the simple reason, the many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be assessed from a quality blood test. And nowadays with an advent of modern DNA tests, you can also analyze for instance what your biological age is and compare it to your chronological age. And obviously it's your biological age that really matters. The challenge with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests, however, is that you get information back about metabolic factors, hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do with that information. Inside Tracker makes it very easy to know what to do with that information to optimize your health. They have a personalized platform, it's a dashboard that you go to, you can click on the level of any hormone metabolic factor, lipid, et cetera. And it will tell you the various sorts of interventions based on nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, that you can use to bring those numbers into the range that are ideal for you. If you'd like to try inside Tracker, you can visit insidetracker.com slash human to get 20% off any of inside Tracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com slash human to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality. They also have some really unique features because they are customized to your unique sleep needs. I've talked over and over again on this podcast and on another podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. There's just simply no other substitute for a quality night sleep on a regular basis. I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress for well over a year now, and it's the best sleep that I've ever had, and that's in large part because the mattress was designed for me. What you need to know, however, is what's the ideal mattress for you? And you can do that by going to Helix site. You can take their brief quiz, which will ask you to sleep on your side, your back, your stomach, or maybe you don't know, or maybe all three, do you tend to run hotter, cold in the night, maybe you know, maybe you don't. At the end of that short quiz, they will match you to the ideal mattress for you. I matched to the dusk, the DUSK mattress, but again, that's what I need. That's not necessarily what you need in order to get your best night's sleep. But if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to helixleep.com slash human, take their two minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you, and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order and two free pillows. They have terrific pillows, and you get to try out that mattress for a hundred nights risk free. They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it, but I'm certain you will. Again, if you're interested in you go to helixleep.com slash human, for up to $200 off your mattress order and two free pillows. And now for my discussion with Dr. Peter Atia. Peter, thanks for joining me today. Thanks for having me, man. I'm looking forward to this for a very long time. How am I? I'm a huge fan of your podcast. I know that you went to Stanford and worked with a number of people that are colleagues of mine. So for me, this is already a thrill, just to just be doing this. Yeah, well, it's quite a nice question. I have a ton of questions, but I want to start off with something that I wonder a lot about, and that I know many other people wonder about, which is how to assess their current health and their trajectory in terms of health and well-being. Specifically, as it relates to blood work. So what are your thoughts on blood work? Is it necessary for the typical person? So this is somebody who's not dealing with some acute syndrome or illness. And at what age would you suggest people start getting blood work? How frequently should they get blood work? How often do you get blood work done, et cetera? Yeah, there's a lot there. I mean, the way I talk about this with patients is first taking everything back to the objective. So what's the thing we're trying to optimize? So if a person says, look, I'm trying to break 10 hours for an Iron Man. I don't know that blood work is going to be a game-changing aspect of their trajectory and their training. You know, they're going to benefit much more from sort of functional analyses of performance. So I'm assuming based on the question that you're really coming at this through the lens of living longer and living better through the lifespan health space. Most lens? Yeah. And just I think most people have some sense of their vitality or lack of vitality. But I think everyone wonders whether or not they could feel better and whether or not blood work will give them a window into how they might go about feeling better. Yeah, I think it does to some extent, but I also think that it has a lot of blind spots. So I kind of, you know, break things down into the two vectors that make up longevity, which are lifespan and health span. So lifespan is the easiest of those vectors to understand because it's pretty binary. You're a live or you're not alive, you're a aspiring or you're not, you make ATP or you don't end up story. So what gets in the way of lifespan is essentially the forehorsesment of disease, right? So, athletic disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and metabolic disease, which directly isn't the cause of many deaths. But you know, basically creates the foundation to all of those other diseases. So, you know, if you're a non-smoker, what I just rattled off is about 80% of your death. So, how does blood work help address those? It varies. So on the Athroschlorotic standpoint, it's a very good predictor of risk if you know what to look for. So primarily, APOB would be the single most important life-approaching that we care about. I guess playing with that means in a second. And then also, you know, other markers of inflammation and the Thelial Health and metabolic health. When it comes to cancer, blood testing in the sense of biomarkers is not particularly helpful. Outside of knowing that the second leading environmental or modifiable cause of cancer is metabolic ill health after smoking. So, we don't actually know a lot about cancer in the sense of what causes it. It's really stochastic and it's a lot of bad luck. So, we know that smoking drives it and we know that even though epidemiologically we say obesity drives it, what really means is metabolic poor health. It's probably the hyper-insulinemia that comes with obesity that drives it. So, biomarkers help with that, but there's still an enormous blind spot to cancer. We could talk about liquid biopsies aside because those aren't really biomarkers studies, but that way. On the neurodegenerative decide, you know, I don't think we have a lot of insight that comes to understanding Parkinson's disease. But when it comes to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, which is the most prevalent form of dementia, I think the biomarkers can be quite helpful. They overlap a lot with the atherosclerotic diseases. So, the same things that, you know, drive the risk of heart disease or driving the risk of dementia. And then there's some novel stuff as well. If you include genetic testing, which you can get out of a blood test, we get a whole suite of genes, not just apoe, but far more, you know, new on stuff than that. They can also play a role. So, you can stratify risk in that sense. So, in aggregate, I would say, you know, blood testing with biomarkers provides pretty good insight into lifespan. When you get into health span, you have kind of the cognitive, physical, emotional domains. I think here the biomarkers are far less helpful. And here we kind of rely more on functional testing. So, when it comes to sort of the cognitive piece, you know, you can do cognitive testing. In terms of long-term risk, a lot of the things that imply good cognitive health as you age are in line with the same things that you would do to reduce the risk of dementia. So, all the biomarkers that you would look to improve through dementia risk reduction, you would be improving through cognitive health. On the physical side, I mean, outside of looking at hormone levels and things which we look at extensively and understanding how those might. And so, in the end, aid in or prevent some of the metrics that matter, it really is that this is a biomarker, a side thing. I mean, I'd be much more interested in a person's dexa, CPET testing, VO2 max testing, you know, zone two lactate testing, fat oxidation. Those, what I consider more functional tests that give me far more insight into that. And then, of course, the emotional piece, which depending on, you know, who you are, might be the single most important piece without which none of this other stuff matters. You're totally miserable human being, your relationship suck. I don't think any of this other stuff matters. And certainly there's nothing that I'm looking at in biomarkers that's giving me great insight into that. Do you ask about emotional state, where do you try and assess emotional state indirectly when you do an intake with one of your patients? Probably not so much in the intake because I think it takes a while to form a relationship with a patient before that starts to become something that they're necessarily going to want to talk with you about. But I definitely think of it as an important part of what we do. And I think without it, none of this other stuff really matters. Again, the irony of thinking about how many years I spent sort of in pursuit of fully optimizing every detail of everything without any attention being paid to that dimension is not lost on me. And, and look, there are some patients who, that's just not something that's something that's compartmentalized. Maybe they're, you know, they're doing well in that department. Maybe they aren't, but they just aren't willing to engage on that yet. In terms of frequency of blood testing, if somebody feels pretty good and is taking a number of steps exercising nutrition, etc. To try and extend lifespan and improve health span is once a year frequent enough and should a 20 year old start getting blood worked on just to get a window into what's going on. Assuming that they can afford it or their insurance can cover it. Yeah, I mean, look, I certainly think everybody should be screened early in life because if you look at like what's the single most prevalent genetic driver of Athoscarosis is LP little A. So unfortunately, most physicians don't know what LP little A is and yet, you know, somewhere between eight and 12% of the population has a high enough, depending on who you, you know, I had a recent guest on my podcast who suggested it could be as high as 20% have a high enough LP little A that it is contributing to Athoscarosis. So to not want to know that when it's genetically determined, right, this is something that, you know, you're born with this and you only need to really check it once. Why we wouldn't want to know that in a 20 year old when it can contribute to a lot of the early Athoscarosis we see in people. You know, it's just, you know, it's leaving money on the table in my opinion. The frequency with which you need to test really comes down to the state of interventions, you know, I don't think it makes sense to just do blood tests for the sake of doing blood tests. There has to be kind of a reason is something changing. You know, a blood test is for the most part a static intervention. It's a, it's a, it's a look at a window in time. And there's benefit in having, you know, a few of those over the course of a year. If you're unsure about a level, so if something comes back and it doesn't look great. Yeah, it might make sense just to recheck it without reacting to it. But typically, you know, in patients, we might check blood two to four times a year, but we're also probably doing things in there to, to now check like, hey, you know, we gave this drug that it have the desired outcome. You know, you put on three pounds of muscle and lost three pounds of fat did it have the desired outcome. Speaking of tracking weight and fat lean mass percentages, is that something that you recommend your patients to pretty often? I know people that step on the scale every day, I know people like myself that frankly, I might step on the scale three times a year. I don't really care. I care, I pay attention to other things that are far more subjective. Maybe I'm making a huge mistake. What do your thoughts about quantitative measurements of weight, BMI for the typical person? I think they're pretty crude. I think a dex, I'd rather take a dex annually. And then maybe follow weight a little bit more closely to get a sense of it. And so with a dex, so you're getting at least the way we look at the data, four pieces of information. Now, most people when they do a dex, should I explain what that is? Yeah, I think some people might not know what dex is. And in fact, I confess I have a crude understanding of what it is. I tell me if where I'm wrong. And hopefully where I'm partly partially right. My understanding is that there are a number of different ways to measure lean mass to non-leam mass ratio. And there's one where they put you underwater. There's one where they put you into some sort of non underwater chamber. There's calipering. Yep. And then there's the looking in the mirror and pinching and changing the lighting. Yeah, that's funny. If you've done it enough, you can sort of tell my body fat by my abs. Right? So I can sort of tell by, you know, how good the six pack or how bad the six pack is, what the leanness is. And that's actually not a terrible way to do it. There are, you know, a body builder, for example, which I've never been, can tell you the difference between being 6% 7% 8% 10% just based on the degree of visibility within the abs. But basically a dexus scan is an x-ray. So it's the same principle as, you know, just getting a chest x-ray where ionizing radiation is passed through the body. And there's a plate behind the body that collects what comes through. And the denser, the medium that the electrons are trying to go through, the less of them that are collected. So when you look at an x-ray as everybody's probably seen an x-ray, that which is white is most dense. You know, if you had, you know, piece of metal in your pocket, it would show up as a bright white thing. That's why ribs and bones show up as white. And the things that are the least dense, like the lungs where it's just air are the blackest. And everything is a shade of gray in between. So a dexus is just doing that effectively, but it's a moving x-ray. So you lay down on a bed and it takes maybe 10 minutes and this little very low power x-ray kind of goes over your body. And the plate beneath it is is collecting information that is basically allowing it to differentiate between three things. Bone, mineral content, fat, other. And the other is quantified as lean body mass. So that's organs, muscles, everything else. So when most people do a dexus, they get the report back and the reports are horrible. I'd be at to see one company that can do this in a way that isn't objectively horrible. We've created our own templates. So we have our own dashboard for how we do this because we've just given up on trying to use theirs. But the first thing most people look at is what's my body fat? And this is the gold standard outside of MRI or something that's only used for research purposes. So a dexus is going to produce a far better estimate of body fat than calipers or buoyancy testing or things like that. Provided the machinery as well calibrated in the operator knows how to use it. I've heard some people argue that in the hands of like the guy who's been doing calipers his whole life, it could probably be comparable with calipers. But nevertheless, for an off the shelf tech, you know, dexus amazing. You know, of the four things that get spit out of the dexus, we think that the body fat is the least interesting. And so I would rank that as fourth on the list of what's germane to your health. The other three things that you get spit out are bone mineral density. And then the metrics that allow you to compute like to basically compute what's called appendicular lean mass index and fat free mass index. And so those three metrics are significantly more important than body fat. And the reason is as follows, right? So bone mineral density basically speaks to your risk of osteoporosis and osteopeenia. That doesn't sound very sexy to people are age, you know, 50 year old guys listening to this. It's like a big deal. But for a 50 year old woman, this is a huge deal, right? A woman who's just about to go through menopause or has just gone through menopause is it an enormous risk for osteopeenia and then ultimately osteoporosis? Because estrogen is the single most important hormone in regulating bone mineral density. And we can come back and talk about why that's the case. But it's very interesting how the biomechanics of bones work and why estrogen specifically is so important. And this is a huge cause of morbidity, right? So, you know, if you're over the age of 65 and you fall and break your hip, your one year morbidity is about 30 to 40%. But again, just to put that in English, if you're 65 or older, you fall and break your hip. There's a 30 to 40% chance you're dead in a year. Well, bones matter. So, we want to really get a sense of where you stack up for your age, for your sex. And if you're anywhere off the pace, we have to ramp up our strategy and be super aggressive about how to increase that. Or at a minimum prevent any further decay. And are there age related charts for the sorts of things? Yeah, this is this all gets spit out into what's called a z score. So when you're looking at your BMD, it's going to give you a z score. So a z score of zero means, and you understand it's, but it's like, it's a z score referring to a probability distribution in a standard mode. So z score of zero means you're at the 50th percentile for your age in sex. Is z score of plus one, your one's to interdiviation above minus one blow, et cetera. There's also a t score, which is doing the same thing, but comparing you to a young person. And so the t score is technically used to make the diagnosis of osteopenia osteoporosis. We tend to look more at the z score and basically say, look, if your z score right now is minus one in four years, I want your z score to be zero. Not necessarily because you've increased that entire way, but maybe you've increased slightly while it's expected that you would have declined. I see. What are some things that we can do to improve bone mineral density at any age? So it turns out there's a real critical window in which we are malleable. So depending on the age at which someone's listening to us discuss this, you know, if you're, if you're under 20 25, you are still in that time of your life when you are able to reach your potential. So it turns out that strength training is probably the single best thing you can do. And this was a surprise to me because we, you know, we did an AMA on this topic a little while ago and that's when I got, you know, really deep on this with our analysts. My assumption was a running must be the best, like some sort of impact must be the best thing you can do is, you know, I assumed running would be better than swimming and cycling. But it turned out that power lifting was probably the best thing you could do. And I think once you understand how bones work, it became more clear, which is, you know, power lifting is really putting more of a sheer force from the muscle via the tendon on the knee. And that's what the bones are really sensing. They're sensing that sheer force that's being applied through the bone in a compressive way, depending on the bone, of course. And that's what's basically activating the osteoblasts, which are the cells that are, you know, allowing bone to be built. So it's, this turns out to be probably more important for females. Because how high you can get during that period of development say till you're 20 or 25, basically sets your trajectory for the rest of your life. So where we get into real trouble is with patients who, for example, used large amounts of inhaled steroids during that period of their life, because let's say they had really bad asthma. Or patients who needed large amounts of corticosteroids for some other immune-related condition. So during their critical window of development, they were taking a drug that was impairing this process. So, you know, we have some patients like that in our practice, and that's, you know, just in an enormous liability that we're working really hard to overcome, you know, with nutrition, with hormones, with drugs, with training. And, you know, it's, you know, it's just something you have to be aware of. I wasn't aware that, um, inhalants for asthma and things that sort of can impair hormonal density. Yeah, they're steroid based. Some of them, of course, are just data agonists and they're fine. So anything corticosteroid like, and then I always get asked this question, and then I always reflexively want to say no, but I don't really know the answer, so I don't reply. What about topical corticosteroid? Yeah, people will put corticone cream to me. It seems almost inconceivable that a little would have a systemic effect, but then again, what do I know? It's all, it's all dose and, it's all dose and time related. So, you know, if you're talking about like, I've got a little rash under my skin, I'm going to put, you know, corticosteroids on, probably not. But, but certainly with enough of it, put on, I mean, it is absorbed, so it could be an issue. But that's not typically what we're concerned with. I mean, we're mostly concerned with people that are, you know, taking even modest amounts of predenazone for months, years at a time. Or like I said, kids that are using steroid inhalers for years and years and years. Again, I'm not suggesting that if your kids on a steroid inhaler, they shouldn't be. You have to solve the most important problem, and if, as a most important problem, so be it. I think you just want to turn that into, okay, well, how much more imperative is it that our kid is doing things that are putting a high amount of stress on their bones and the other muscles to make sure that they're in that maximum capacity to build? Do you think that somebody in their 30s or 40s or 50s could still benefit from training in terms of bone mineral density and longevity as it relates to bone mineral density? Given that there's this key window earlier, they might have missed that. Oh, yeah, no, no, this is essential for the rest of life because you're now trying to prevent the fall off. So, so basically the way it works is you're sort of from birth to say 20 year on your in growth from 20 to 50, you plateau at 50 men start to decline. But it's really small women start to decline and it's precipitous. And it's related to the drop and estrogen that's with menopause or premenopause. And can we get into any of the broad contours of what that straight training looks like? We had a doctor and a galvan on the show. We talked a lot about ways to build strain versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. I think there's pretty good agreement across the fields of physiotherapy, et cetera, of physiology and medicine. In terms of how to do that, but my understanding is fairly low repetition ranges. So this is anywhere from one to six repetitions typically not aiming for, you know, a pump hypertrophy, that sort of thing. But heavy loads that are hard to move 80% to one repetition maximum or more done with long rest periods. The two to three times a week type thing. Is that about right? If you look at the literature on this, it's going to tell you it's going to differentiate power lifting from weightlifting. In other words, yeah, you do need to be kind of moving against a very heavy load. Now again, that can look very different depending on your level of experience, like I really like dead lifting. Now, I mean, I can count the number of days left in my life when I'm going to want to do sets over 400 pounds. But, you know, I'll pick and choose the days that I do, but, but you know, I grew up doing those things. I'm comfortable with those movements. If I had a 60 year old woman who's never lifted weights in her life who we now have to get lifting, I mean, we could get her to deadlift, but I think I wouldn't make, you know, perfect the enemy of good. I'd be happy to put her on a leg press machine and just get her doing that. It's not as pure a movement as a deadlift, but who cares? Right? We can still put her at a heavy load for her and do so safely. So, now that's it. I mean, there was a study that was done in Australia, and I'm, you know, hopefully we can find a link to it. There's a video on YouTube that actually kind of has the PI sort of walking through the result. I could send it to you. Okay. And it's just amazing. They took a group of older women. They looked like they were in their 60s or 70s who had never lifted weights in their life who, you know, had osteopena and some probably already had osteoporosis. And they basically just put them on a strength training protocol. And it is remarkable to watch these women. They're doing good mornings. They're doing deadlifts. They're picking heavy things up off the ground. I think one woman was picking up, kind of I want to say she was like, picking like 50, 60 kilos up off the ground. I mean, just staggering sums of weight for these women who have never done anything. And their bone health is improving at this age. So the goal, frankly, is to just, you know, never get to the point where, you know, you have to do this for the first time. You know, strength training is such an essential part of our existence that, you know, there's never, you know, it's never too late to start, but you should never stop. Well, that advice. Is it a systemic effect or a local effect? So, for instance, let's say that, well, my mother is in her late 70s. She actually used to be really strong when we were kids. She could move this fish tank. That was in my room long before I could move it. And she's really strong over the years. I wouldn't call her frail by any means, but I certainly think she could benefit from some strength training. Let's say she were to start doing some leg presses or start even with air squads and maybe work up to some push ups. But the effects all local, meaning if she were to just train her legs or just do push ups, would it only be the loads applied to the limbs and muscles and tissues? She's thinking we're all... I think that's where the bulk of it is, yeah. So you need to train the whole body, essentially. Yeah, now keep in mind, the diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis is based on only three locations. The left hip, the right hip and the lumbar spine. So, you know, that's just the convention by which we make the diagnosis. And I think part of that has to do with that's where the majority of the insults occur. You know, not all of the insults. I've seen people that have, you know, because of horrible bone density. They're fracturing ankles in tibia, fibula, like they're having low-tib fib fractures just walking. So clearly bone density outside of those regions does matter, but much of it is really focused on... And by the way, you know, you fall, you break a wrist. So this is a systemic issue. But the majority of the response is a local response because it really comes down to putting a load directly on that bone. And then having that bone in kind respond by laying down more bone. Before we continue with today's discussion, I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor Athletic Greens. Now called AG1. Athletic Greens, aka AG1, is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes. I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day is that it supplies total foundational coverage of my vitamin mineral needs. And it supplies important nutrients that I need to support my gut microbiome. The gut microbiome, as many of you know, supports the immune system. It also supports the so-called gut brain access, which is vital for mood, for energy levels, for regulating focus. And many other features of our mental health and physical health that impact our daily performance and high performance in any endeavors we might be involved in. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to AthleticGreens.com-Huberman and claim a special offer. They're giving away five-free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order. And of course, vitamin D3K2, or vital for all sorts of things like hormone health and metabolic health and K2 for cardiovascular health and calcium regulation. Again, you can go to AthleticGreens.com-Huberman to claim that special offer. You mentioned falling and the problems with falling and breaking things and mortality related to that. I wonder whether or not there are also health related effects of just having weak bones that are not just about falling and breaking a bone and dying a year later. Even though that's obviously very severe. Because I think when people hear about that, somebody will might think, well, I'll just be more careful. I just move more slowly. I'll sit in a wheelchair if I need to. Even though I might be able to walk, if it keys from falling, some people, I think adopt that mentality. What are some of the benefits of having high bone mineral density for men and women that are perhaps independent of risk of injury? Well, I think it's actually the inverse of what you just said, right? It's sort of like, you have to sort of be able to articulate what it is you want in your marginal decade. So we use this thing in our practice called the marginal decade. Marginal decade is the last decade of your life. So everyone will have a marginal decade. That's the only thing I can tell you with absolute certainty. Right? I believe you. There's no immortality. There's no hidden elixir that's going to help us live to be whatever. I mean, we're all going to be in our last decade at some point. An outside of people who die suddenly or through an accident, most of us know when we're in that marginal decade. You might not know the day you enter it, but most people, you know, who are old enough, if you tell them, are you in the last decade of your life? They probably have a sense that they are. So I think the exercise that we like to go through with our patients very early on is have them in exquisite detail, more detail than they've ever considered. So we have to prompt them with like 50 questions, lay out what their marginal decade should look like. Wow. That's a serious exercise. It's a very serious exercise, right? Like what tell me everything that is going to happen in your marginal decade? I don't know when it's going to be under it could be 87 to 97 if we're doing well, right? It might be 79 to 89. I don't know. But I, you know, we would really be in a very nuanced exploration of that topic. And I think until you do that, all of this other stuff is just abstract and kind of nonsense. You know, until a person can tell you what it is that they want to be doing in that last decade, you can't design a program to get them there. I mean, think about it. You know, someone wants to do an Iron Man. We take it for granted that we know what the objective is. I have to be able to swim two and a half miles. I have to be able to get out, take my wet suit off, hop on my bike, ride 112 miles, get off my bike, take the bike shoes off, put the run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like we get it. We know what the objective is. And only by knowing that, can you train? Can you imagine if I said to you, and I'm going to have you do an athletic event in a year, start training? I'm not going to tell you what it is, just do it. Right. It could be playing basketball. It could be swimming to Catalina Island. It could be running 100 miles. You wouldn't be able to do it. So similarly, if we don't know what our marginal decade is meant to be, there's no way to train for it. Do you think this is a good exercise for anyone and everyone to do on their own regardless of age? Here I'm hearing this thinking. I need to think about when my last decade might be and what I want that to look like. Absolutely. I mean, when I say we do it with our patients, that's only because that's the population I work with. But there's simply no reason everybody shouldn't be going through this exercise. And then you sort of back script from there. Yeah. We can't even occur in health status. Exactly. We call it back casting. So the first step we do is once we've really delineated what the objective function looks like, we then say, okay, how do you break down that into metrics that we can measure? So you know, you describe doing a whole bunch of things. Okay, just to let you know, to do that, we'll require a VO2 max of 30 milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram. And the person will say, okay, what does that mean? We'll say, well, that's a measure of your maximal uptake of oxygen. And that declines at about 8% to 10% per decade. So if you have to be at 30, unless just assume you're going to be doing that at 90. So what do you need to be at 80, 70, 60, 50? Okay, here's what it would need to be at 50. Okay, what are you now? Ah, there's a big gap. You're below where you need to be now. So you're obviously higher than 30 now. But if you're only at 42 now and you need to be at 30 and 40 years, you're not going to cut it. You have to be a lot thinner. Okay, now let's do the same exercise around strength and stability. And without exception, most people when they do this exercise will find out they're well below where they need to be. So the gravity of aging is more vicious than people realize. And therefore the height of your glider needs to be much higher than you think it is when you're are age. If you want to be able to do the things we probably want to be able to do when we're 90. I absolutely love this approach. I've never done it in terms of my health. I've always thought about what I want to accomplish in the next 3 to 6 months or next year. So and by the way, that's a great approach. That's forecasting. Forecasting is fantastic. Forecasting is really good at short term things. It doesn't work for long term things. Long term, you have to do backcasting. This backcasting approach really appeals to me because in my career, well, I never anticipate, excuse me, I never anticipate. I'd be podcasting. But that's what I did at some point is an undergraduate. I look professors and I think that looks like a pretty good life. They seem pretty happy. I talked to a few of them and then I figured out what I need to do at each stage in order to get to that next wrong on the ladder and just kind of figure it out in a backcasting kind of way as you refer to it. I think this is incredibly useful because it puts all the questions about blood work and how often they get blood work and what to measure in a really nice context. That's a highly individualized. I've never heard of this before. And I should give a nod to Annie Duke. I used to always refer to this as reverse engineering. But in Annie Duke's book, she wrote about this exact thing and called it backcasting. And I was like, I like the term backcasting better. I think it's more intuitive and reverse engineering. Yeah, there's a real genius to it and I think it has set so many things into the appropriate bins and trajectories. I've heard you talk before about some of the prime movers for longevity and all risk mortality. And I'd love for you to review a little bit of that for us. I think we all know that we shouldn't smoke because it's very likely that we'll die earlier if we smoke nicotine. I'm neither a marijuana nor a nicotine smoker, so I'll on stable ground there, but anytime we see smoking nowadays, people really want to distinguish between cannabis and nicotine. So I am curious about any differences there in terms of impact on longevity. But in that context, what are the things that anyone and everyone can do should do to live longer, basically? How long have you got? Well, you tell me. You tell me. I'd like to live to be, I'd like my final decade to be between 90 and 100. Oh, no, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm getting on this. Please bend from now until you're 90. Well, there's a risk of that, but top contour is fine. I know you've done a lot of content on this, and we'll give people links to some of that more in-depth content. But you know, let's say we saw our short flight from here to San Diego before and lost our close now. And we got takeoff in landing, and we don't want to kink our neck too much by doing this thing. So if I just said, hey, you know, give me the extended version of the 3x5 card. Yeah. So let's start with a couple of the things that you've already highlighted. It's a smoking. How much does smoking increase your risk of all cause mortality? And the reason we like to talk about what's called ACM or all cause mortality is it's really agnostic to how you die. And that doesn't always make sense. I mean, if you're talking about, you know, a very specific intervention like a anti-cancer therapy that you really care about cancer specific mortality or heart specific mortality. But when we talk about these sort of broad things, we like to talk about ACM. So, you know, using smoking smoking is approximately a 40% increase in the risk of ACM. What does that translate to? And that means I'm shortening my life by 40%. No, it means at any point in time there's a 40% greater risk that you're going to die relative to a non-smoker and never smoker. Yeah. Yeah. So it's important to distinguish. It doesn't mean your lifespan is going to be 40% less. It means at any point in time standing there, your risk of death is 40% higher. And by the way, that'll catch up with you, right? At some point that catches up. High blood pressure. It's about a 20 to 25% increase in all cause mortality. You take something really extreme like end stage kidney disease. So these are patients that are on dialysis waiting for an organ. And again, there's a confounder there because there's what's the underlying condition that leads you to that. It's, you know, profound hypertension, you know, significant type 2 diabetes that's been uncontrolled. You know, that's enormous. That's about 175% increase in ACM. So the hazard ratio is like 2.75. Type 2 diabetes is probably about a 1.25 as well. So 25% increase. So now the question is like, how do you improve? So what are the things that improve those? Now here we do this by comparing low to high achievers and other metrics. So if you look at low muscle mass versus high muscle mass, what is the improvement? And it's pretty significant. It's about 3x. So if you compare low muscle mass people to high muscle mass people as they age, the low muscle mass people have about a 3x hazard ratio, or 200% increase in all cause mortality. Now, if you look at the data more carefully, you realize that it's probably less the muscle mass fully doing that. And it's more the high association with strength. And when you start to tease out strength, you can realize that strength could be probably 3.5x as a hazard ratio, meaning about 250% greater risk if you have low strength to high strength. And high strength is the ability to move loads at 80 to 90. So it's all defined by given studies. So the most common things that are used are actually, you know, they're used for the purposes of experiments that make it easy to do. I don't even think they're the best metrics. So they're usually using like grip strength, leg extensions, and like wall sits squats, things like that. So how long can you sit in a squatted position at 90 degrees without support? Would be a great demonstration of quad strength, a leg extension. How much weight can you hold for how long relative to body weight? Things like that. You know, we have a whole strength program that we do with our patients. We have something called the SMA, so it's a strength metrics assessment. And we put them through 11 tests that are really difficult. You know, like a dead hang is one of how long can you dead hang your body weight? Stuff like that. So we're trying to be more granular in that insight, but tie it back to these principles. If you look at cardiovascular respiratory fitness, it's even more profound. So if you look at people who are in the bottom 25% for their age in sex, in terms of VO2 max, and you compare them to the people that are just at the 50th to 75th percentile. You're talking about a two-x difference roughly in the risk of ACM. If you compare the bottom 25% to the top 2.5%. So you're talking about, you know, bottom quarter to the elite for a given age. You're talking about 5x for 100% difference in all cause mortality. That's probably the single strongest association I've seen for any modifiable behavior. Incredible. So when you say elite, these are people that are running marathons that are pretty rapid-clip. Not necessarily. It's just like what the VO2 max is for that. Like my VO2 max would be in the elite for my age group. My VO2 max. You know, but again, I'm training very deliberately to make sure that it's in that. So I wouldn't consider myself elated anything anymore. But I still maintain a VO2 max that is elite for my age. I can say you an elite physician in the pot. And guy all around. But true. But in terms of, okay, so for the point is, you don't have to be a world-class athlete to be a lead here. Got it. So maybe we could talk a little bit about the specifics around the training to get into that, you know, top two tiers there. Because it seems that those are enormous positive effects of cardiovascular exercise. Far greater than the sorts of numbers that I see around. Let's just say supplementary or supplementary. Well, then, and that's, you know, like this is my whole pet peeve in life, right? It's like, I just can't get enough of the machinating and arguing about this supplement versus that supplement. And I feel like you shouldn't be having those arguments until you have your exercise house in order. You know, you shouldn't be arguing about your, this nuance of your carnivore diet versus this nuance of your paleo diet versus this nuance of your vegan diet. Like until you can deadlift your body weight for 10 reps. Like then you can come and talk about this thing. Just like let's just grab with some metrics. Until your VO2 max is at least of the 75th percentile. And you're able to dead hang for at least a minute. And you're able to wall sit for at least two. Like we could rattle off a bunch of relatively low hanging fruit. I wish there was a rule that said, like you couldn't talk about anything else. Health related. Like we can make that rule. And we want to listen to it. I don't know about that. We can make whatever rules we want. We can call it at T.A.'s rule. One thing I've done before in this podcast on social media is just barring from the tradition in science, which is it's inappropriate to name something after yourself unless you were assigned just before 1950. But it's totally appropriate to name things after other people's. I'm going to call it a T.A.'s rule. Until you can do the following things. Don't talk about this. Please refrain from talking about supplements and nutrition. Hereafter thought of referred to and referenced as a T.A.'s rule. I coined the phrase not him. So there's no ego involved. But he's now a T.A.'s rule. Watch out. Hashtag a T.A.'s rule. Okay. Wikipedia entered a T.A.'s rule. In all seriousness and I am serious about that. Dead hang for about a minute seems like a really good goal for a lot of people. At least. I think that's our goal. I think we have a minute and a half is the goal for a 40 year old woman. Two minutes is the goal for 40 year old man. So we adjust them up and down based on age and gender. Great. And then the walls it. What's what are some of the ways it was. We do as just a straight squat air squat at 90 degrees. And I believe two minutes is the standard for both men and women at 40. Great. And then because for some people thinking in terms of you two maxes, a little more complicated, they might not have access to the equipment or the equipment, but they might not have access to the equipment. But I think that's a very good question. So there are really good VO2 maxes to majors online. And you can plug in your activity. So it would be at a bike, run or rowing machine. And it can give you a sense of that. And I don't remember. I used to know all of those. But now that I just actually do the testing, I don't recall them. But it's exactly that line of thinking. Like, can you run a mile in this time if you can. Your VO2 maxes approximately this. Great. And I think somewhere in my podcast realm, I've got all those charts posted of like, this is by age by sex. This is what the VO2 maxes in each of those buckets. Trim it will provide links to those. We'll have our people find those links. And then you mentioned deadlifting body weight 10 times. I just made that one up. That's not one that we include. But something like that. We use farmer carries. So we'll say for a male, you should be able to farmer carry your body weight for, I think we have two minutes. So that's half your body weight in each hand. You should be able to walk with that for two minutes. For women, I think we're doing 75% of body weight or something like that. Yeah. Great. I love it. As indirect measures of how healthy. Yeah. It's basically grip strength. It's mobility. I mean, again, walking with that much weight for some people initially is really hard. You know, we use different things like vertical jump, ground contact time, if you're jumping off a box, things like that. So it's really trying to capture. And it's an evolution, right? Like I think the test is going to get only more and more involved as we, as we, as we get involved. Because it took us about a year. Beth Lewis did the majority of the work to develop this. Beth runs our strength and stability program in the practice. And you know, basically, I just have to have a good time with, like, hey, go out to the literature and come up with all of the best movements that we think are proxies for what you need to be like the most kick ass, you know, what we call centenarian to Catholic, which is the person living in their marginal decade at the best. Well, what I'm about to say is certainly a mechanistic leap, but if you look at the literature on exercise related neurogenesis in mice or brain atrophy or brain hypertrophy, et cetera, in animal models. It's very clear that the best way to get a nervous system to atrophy, to lose neurons, shrink neurons and or lose connections between neurons is to stop that animal from moving or to deenrich its environment, to private of some sensory input or multiple sensory inputs. And the best way to enhance the size of neurons, the number of connections between neurons and maybe even the number of neurons is to enrich its environment and get it moving while enriching that environment. You know, and you're, I think it's, it's very difficult for me to say that the same is not true in humans. And so the first time this became clear to me was in 2014. I had an analyst, Dan Palachar, and I said, Dan, I'm going to give you a project that is vexing me to know end, which is, I want you to look at all of the literature that we have both mechanistic and clinical trial data that talks about Alzheimer's prevention. And I want to know every single type of input, and I want to have a clear sense of via what mechanism does it offer, what mode of protection. And it took Dan, and this was obviously we iterated a lot on this together. And he came back with kind of an amazing presentation that took all, I don't know, nine months to a year of work. And what amazed me was when he came back to it, he said, the single greatest efficacy we can point to is exercise. And I was like, Dan, that's a lot of be nonsense, dude. There's no way exercise is the single best thing you can do for the brain. There has to be some drug you've missed. There has to be some other thing that you've missed. And he's like, no, like, this is hands down the best thing, because you're, you know, it's not just what it's doing to be DNA, if it's not just what it's doing to vascular endothelium. It's not just what it's doing to glucose, just post-line insulin signaling, all the things like, it's just touching every aspect of the brain. And I was very skeptical for about six months, kind of really pushed on him. And I was like, I think you're missing something, Dan, I think you're missing something. And then finally in the end, looped in Richard Isaacson, who's in neurologist that we work with really closely on Alzheimer's prevention. And you know, ultimately it turned into a paper that we wrote basically about this topic. And a few others, because again, you sure it's not EPA and DHA, like that's got to have a bigger impact. And again, there are a lot of things that I think do matter, and there's a whole host of things that we do for Alzheimer's prevention. But I think you're obviously right, there's not one thing that all tell patients is more important than exercising. And by the way, it's not this sort of pathetic recommendations that are made. Like, it's, you have to exercise a lot more if you want to get this maximum benefit. You will get, you know, the maximum benefit comes going from nothing to something. So if you go from being completely sedentary to doing 15 met hours per week, you'll get probably a 50% reduction in risk. So a met hour, a met just for people who don't know is a metabolic equivalent. So we're, we're exerting about 1.3 met sitting here talking. If we were sitting here being quiet, it would be about 1 met. You know, walking really briskly would be about 5 metts. So 15 met hours per week would be 3 1 hour really brisk walks. That's not a lot of work. But just going from doing nothing to doing that would give you 50% of the benefit that you would get from going all the way. Now again, I think I'm personally a little skeptical of how much that's. I think it's probably a bit less than that. I think there's more upside than people appreciate, but the studies I don't think can truly capture that. But look, you know, there's, there's no reason to not be exercising more than that and capture more benefit, even though the rate at which you accrue it is less. So speaks to the health span side of this, which is not necessarily captured in those data. The health span gets back to the functional piece we opened with, which is what do you want to be doing in your marginal decade. Do you want to be able to pick up a great grand kid if they come running at you. Do you want to be able to get up off the floor. Do you want to be able to play on the floor with a kid and then get up on your own. I think those people are thinking, final years of life, they're trying to think, how can they take themselves to the bathroom, they're thinking how they sit off the toilet. I mean, yeah, really basic vegetative type functions, right. At some level. I love this again, this idea of marginal decade and using that as a way to backcast to actual methods and behaviors and protocols at once should be doing on a daily basis. I'll use anicadata as it's now called to site just I know three Nobel Prize winners, which doesn't mean anything except that they did beautiful work, but the point is that they're all in their 90s. So I'll name them because I'm complimenting them for what they've done, not just their work, but what I'm about to describe is that Eric can tell at Columbia. Nobel Prize winner for work on memory, towards a visa of work on neuroplasticity and then Richard Axel who's also at Columbia Nobel Prize winning work for molecular biology of smelling and molecular biology. Generally, all three of them still alive, Richard's younger compared to the other two. All three of them either swim jog or play tennis or racket ball, I think, has Richard's thing multiple times per week. Eric was they're all cognitively still extremely sharp. Still interested in the arts doing science curious about science running laboratories writing books going on podcasts. I mean, it's incredible. Again, that's anicadata. But I was kind of surprised to learn that colleagues that were so intellectually strong were also so obsessed with exercise. I mean, they really are obsessed with their exercise routine and early on linked that to their some of their intellectual vigor over time. I wanted just also he says a jumping off point to ask about one kind of niche thing, but it comes up. I don't know I'm going to out which one of those told me this, but one of those three individuals, I'm choosing excessive amount of nicarate used to be a smoker and I asked him why. And he said because in his estimation, it's protective against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's or at least the nicotinic acetycalling augmentation of nicotine because nicotine is a cilcalling receptor. Obviously, is known to create a state of focus and neural enhancement. What are your thoughts about not smoking? Let's just I just want to be really clear people don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine is going to shorten your life. Just terrible idea addictive et cetera, in my opinion. But what are your thoughts about augmenting acetycalling through the use of nicotine in order to keep the brain healthy and focused? Again, this is one Nobel Prize winner, so it's a truly end of one. But he's so convinced that this matches up with the mechanistic data on acetycalling and cognition that I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. So I can't speak to the AD prevention component of it. I'd have to run that by a couple of my colleagues who I collaborate with on that. But I can definitely speak to the cognitive enhancement piece of it and actually did an AMA on this probably a year ago, where I went into all of the gory details of it and talked about my own use of nicotine, which I'll cycle on and off. I've been doing it for the last 10 years. So what formed do you take it in? I used to use the gum. I don't like the gum anymore. So now I like these little laws and giz. That I have to find a funny story about this. So our mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair mentioned a company company to me a year ago. He's like, hey, have you heard of this company? And I forget the name of the company, but he gave me some name. So I go online and it's like this company selling nicotine. And I'm like, I wonder why he's asked me to do this? Well, I'll just order a bunch and then we'll figure out why because we were, you know, there was some reason we were doing this potentially through investment. So I get up like literally ordered like a lifetime supply of this stuff. And it's pretty good. It's actually it's a really nice little patch because the thing I didn't like about the gum was I hated just the the taste of it. So then the next week I'm talking to David and I'm like, by the way, I ordered all that nicotine stuff you told me about he's like, what? And he goes, oh, the company's name was something else. And it's totally unreligated. It's like, oh, god. So the short answer is I think this stuff is absolutely a concentration enhancing substance. It is addictive and people need to be wary of that. And I'm not addicted to everybody. I personally experience no addiction to it whatsoever. So I can. I could do it every day for 30 days and stop and experience no withdrawal. I could forget about it. It doesn't really seem to matter. You have to be careful with the dose truthfully. I mean, remember, one cigarette is about 1 milligram of nicotine. And a lot of these laws and judges will plow 4 to 8 milligrams into you in one shot. And for someone who is, you know, naive to that, like, I am 4 milligrams is a lot of nicotine in one bowless. So you just have to be very mindful of it. I got a lot of slack when I did this AMA for obvious reasons, but people were like, how can you as a doctor encourage people to use nicotine? I was like, first of all, I'm not encouraging anybody to use it. I just want to be able to talk about the biochemistry of it. And if disclosing that I use it from time to time is an endorsement, then, you know, I apologize for that. But on the list of things that you can do to make your brain a little more focused, I would consider this infinitely safer than what a lot of people are doing, which is using stimulants. I mean, to me, I, you know, I just tell patients out where I like, we are under no circumstance prescribing stimulants. I mean, doesn't stand. Yeah, we're just we're not giving anybody at all. We're not giving anybody five ants or any of these things. Not to say they don't have an appropriate clinical use, but they should be prescribing to the care of somebody who's really monitoring the use case for it. And, and, and, and, and, and, and using that as a tool to enhance, you know, concentration and cognitive performance is not something we're comfortable doing. Yeah, it's rampant on college campuses. I can only, um, arm or daffinoma daffinoma daffinoma, which are slightly different of course, but, uh, so non clinical use, not prescribed for ADHD, but just it's rampant. Recreational use study based use. But the data I've seen on Medafinoma, I'll suggest that it only really provides a no-tropic benefit in someone who is deprived of sleep. Is there data that in a totally well-rested person? There is a no-tropic benefit of Medafinoma. I don't know. I have one experience with Arma Daphno where I took a half a recommended doses was prescribed by a doctor. I went to give a talk. This is an Hawaii. And, um, four hours into the talk at my, uh, co-speaker came up to me and just said, well, first of all, you got a little bit of, uh, spit in the corner of your mouth. And second of all, you have in blinked in three minutes. And third, um, there's only two people left in the audience. There was so lasered in that I got to forgot the context. I'm a little bit of a tunnel vision OCD type. Anyway, but one, that was all it took. I never, I never took anymore of it. It was a powerful stimulant. I take, uh, 300 milligrams of alpha GPC now and again, before some cognitive work, sometimes before workouts. And I do, subjectively feel that narrows my focus in a nice way. But I don't take it more than once or twice a day and more than once a twice a week. I just an example of where, you know, we're talking about exercise versus sort of nutrition and supplements for longevity. I think there may be a whole bunch of things that are kind of interesting around focus, but nothing would compare to changing our environment. Like, I think that if I compare my focus today to my focus when I was in college, there's no comparison. Like in college, I was truly a robot. But I think a large part of it was there was no distraction. There's no email. There's no social media. I mean, I was in college when Mosaic launched in the early 90s. Like, you know, and you had to walk like a mile to get to the computer lab on a big sunwork station to do anything in, you know, some computer code language. So, when you're sitting in your room studying, there was no distraction. And I think that's a far greater component of what it means to be focused than the challenges we have today. You know, my thoughts on this would be if we really wanted to return to a state of focus, we're going to have to individually do something about, you know, our environment. And I don't know what the answer is. Like, I've tried every little trick I can think of like closing my browsers when I'm writing and stuff, but, you know, I'm just not strong enough. Well, like I'll pick up my phone every 20 minutes to look and see if I missed the text message or something stupid. That's pretty infrequent. I did a episode on habits and looking at the data. It seems that people are getting interrupted or interrupting themselves about once every three minutes in the typical workplace. Now that typical has changed with a lot more people working at home. I do put my phone away when I try to work that nothing focuses me like a deadline. A bit of fear based urgency. That's it. Grant deadlines. You know, drop deadlines as I call them or podcasts. And I'm going to record today that nothing works quite like it, but such as like, well, thanks for that off shoot about nicotine. Again, you're not recommending it. I'm not recommending it, but it's clear that the that augmenting the acetylcholine system, which is what nicotine does in its various forms. And some related type of ecology does enhance focus and pretty potently. So I think it's going to be an interesting area for real clinical trials and things like that sort. I love to chat about hormone therapies and hormones generally when Robert Sapolsky came on the podcast. We talked a little bit about menopause in the data around menopause. He's very interested in these findings that I think I'm going to get this right that whether or not women benefit from estrogen therapy to offset menopause really depends on when that therapy is initiated. I don't know if you're aware of those data, but he claimed that if they begin estrogen therapy in the middle to tail end of menopause, the outcomes can be quite bad, whereas if they initiate those estrogen therapies as they enter menopause or even before menopause, then the outcomes can be quite good. What percentage of the patients you treat are male versus female and what ages those patients are of course, but what are your thoughts about estrogen therapy for women menopause and hormone therapies generally for women, maybe even testosterone therapy here about that these days and then we'll talk about men. So our practice is probably 70, 30 male female, so we have lots of women and this is a very important topic. It's also probably, let me think, I just want to make sure I'm not being hyperbolic when I say this. Yeah, I don't think I am. It's hands down the biggest screw up of the entire medical field in the last 25 years. Now again, it's possible in the next hour, I'll think of nope, there's a bigger screw up another another giant. But I don't think I will. I'm pretty confident that I won't be able to think of a bigger act of incompetence than what happened with the women's health initiative in the late 90s and early 2000s, which is effectively the study that turned the entire medical field off hormone replacement therapy for women. So it's important, I think, to explain what the study looked at. So this was a study that was conducted in response to the widely held belief in the 70s and 80s that women should be placed on hormones as they're going through menopause, right? I guess maybe I'll even take a step back, I don't know how much your audience is familiar with how estrogen progesterone work, is it going into that stuff? Yeah, probably worth mentioning a bit of the top contour. Some of them might be familiar with it. We've done episodes on estrogen testosterone, but frankly, as I think back to those, we didn't really go into the biology of estrogen testosterone, you know. Yeah, so, I mean, actually an interesting aside that I always tell my female patients who get a kick out of this. When you look at a woman's labs, you'll see her estrogen, her progesterone, her FSH, her LH, her testosterone, her sex-mobinding, glad that all these things. But based on the units they're reported in, it's a very distorting picture of what the most common endrogen is in her body. If you actually convert them to the same units, she has much more testosterone in her body than estrogen. Interesting. Yeah. I did not know that. Then again, I've never been a woman getting my hormone profile. Yeah, so even though a woman's testosterone is much less than a men than a man's level, it's still more than she has estrogen in her body. Wow. So, phenotypically, right, estrogen is the hormone that's dominating, and so it's that, you know, she has much higher estrogen than a man and much lower testosterone than a man. But in absolute amounts, she has more testosterone than estrogen. Just worth pointing that out. Incredible. So, you know, what's happening to a woman from the age, she starts menstruating, tells you goes through menopause, outside of pregnancy and birth control and stuff like that is she has this cycle, you know, roughly every 28 days, but it can vary. Where at the beginning of her period, we call that day zero, her basic, her estrogen and progesterone are very low. You can't measure them. And then what happens is the estrogen level starts to rise, and it rises in response to a hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, FSH that is getting her ready to ovulate. And she ovulates at about the mid-pointed of her cycle. So, if we're just going to make the math easy, on day 14, she's going to release a follicle from one of her ovaries. And the estrogen level is sort of rising, rising, rising. We love to measure hormones on day five, because I want to have a standardized way in which I measure her hormones. So, our women know if we're in the business of trying to understand her hormones, the day her period starts, even if it's just a day of spotting, that becomes our benchmark and then day five, I want to see every hormone on that day. And if everything is going well, I know what her FSH, LH, Estrodial and Progesterone should be on that day. So, the estrogen rises starts to come down a little bit as she ovulates, and then the loot-nazing hormone kicks on, because it's now going to prepare her uterus for the lining to accommodate a pregnancy. So, now you start to see Estrodial go back, but now for the first time progesterone goes up. So, progesterone has been doing nothing for 14 days, and now it starts to rise. So, the progesterone is the hormone that's dominating the second half, which is called her aeroludial cycle. So, the first 14 days is the follicular cycle, second is the luteal cycle. So, once you get to about the halfway point of that, which is now just to do the math, 21 days in, the body has figured out if she's pregnant or not. And again, most of the time she's not going to be pregnant. So, the body says, oh, I don't need this lining that I've been preparing, I'm going to shed it. So, now progesterone and Estrodial start crashing, and the lining is what is being shed, and that is the men's. By the way, it's that last seven days of that cycle that in a susceptible woman is what creates those PMS symptoms. So, it's like, actually, this is something that you would probably have a better understanding of than me. There is something about this in a susceptible woman, where the enormous reduction of progesterone so quickly is probably impacting something in her brain. So, I think this is a legitimate thing, right? I mean, it's not like, oh, she's crazy because she's having all these PMS symptoms. No. We know that that's the case because if you put women on progesterone for those seven days, those symptoms go away. So, if you can stabilize their progesterone during the last half of their luteal phase, and sometimes we would just do it for the entire luteal phase, just put them on a lodeau so progesterone, all PMS symptoms vanish. Very interesting. I'll have to look up where the progesterone receptors are located in the brain. The Allen brain institute now has beautiful data in teacher hybridization, which looks at the donor, says, Looking at RNA and there are where genes and proteins ought to be expressed in the human brain by using actual human brain tissue sections, has a positive mind. So, I'll take a look at, I think, if you're in the right into the case, what that progesterone emotionality link might be in where it might exist, or what the circuit was. So, then when the estrogen and progesterone reach their nater again, that starts the cycle. So, that cycle is happening over and over and over again. Okay, so it became, you know, well known in the 50s that, okay, a woman is going to stop menstruating at some point, her estrogen goes down. Why don't we just give her estrogen? Because that's clearly going to help with some of the symptoms of menopause. So, what the women experience when they go through menopause, the first symptoms are what are called vasimotor symptoms. So, this is usually in the form of night sweats, hot flashes. So, and depending on the women, this can be really significant, right? These are women who can have a hard time sleeping, they can be having hot flashes during the middle of the day, they can wake up soaked in a pool of sweat. Those tend to pass after a couple of years, and then they get into sort of the more long-term complications of menopause. So, what we call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and then the stuff that we talked about a while ago, which is the osteopemia osteoporosis. A lot of women will complain of brain fog. So, I mean, clearly this was an issue, and it was recognized 70 years ago, why don't we give women estrogen back to replace that hormone? And so, that went on for a couple of decades, maybe last, maybe a decade, and then it was realized, wait a minute, we were driving up the risk of uterine cancer. And the reason for that is if you just give estrogen with no progesterone to antagonize it, you will thicken the endometrium endlessly, and you will increase the risk of hyperplasia, well, you'll definitely undergo hyperplasia, and then ultimately dysplasia. Displasia is precancerous, and ultimately we were seeing that. So, people figured out, well, actually, if you want to give estrogen to a woman who still has her uterus, you have to give her progesterone as well. You have to be able to have a hormone to oppose the estrogen. And then that became effectively in the 1970s, the standard for HRT. So, in the early 1990s, the NIH said, look, we haven't really studied this. You know, we have a ton of epidemiology that says, giving women hormones seems to be doing really good things. They feel better, so they're all their symptoms go away. They seem to have lower risk of heart disease, lower risk of cardiovascular disease, lower risk of bone fractures, everything seems to get better, lower risk of diabetes, but we haven't tested this in a randomized perspective trial. So, let's do this. So that became the WHO. And it randomized, it had two parallel arms, so it had a group for women who did not have a uterus. So these are women that had undergone history, I can be for some other reason, and then it had a group for women that did have their uterus. In the first group, there was a placebo arm, and then an estrogen only arm, and in the other group there was a progesterone plus estrogen versus a placebo. Everything about the way this study was done is a bit wonky. Some of it is justifiable, but it's important to understand. First, the women were all way outside of menopause. So none of these women were started when you would normally start HRT. And there were probably several reasons for that, but one of them is, and I think this is a legitimate reason, they wanted a hard outcomes. They wanted to know death rates. And if you're doing this on women in their 50s, you just weren't going to get it. Right, you couldn't wait too long. Yeah, you got away too long. And if there's only going to be like a seven to ten year study. So they had to do this on women who were much older. They also disproportionately took much sicker women. I believe the prevalence, and again, I'm going to get some of these numbers wrong, and people are going to get all phosphorolated, but you know, I mean, I'm in the ballpark, right. Something like 30, 40% of these women were smokers, the prevalence of obesity, diabetes was enormous. So they, they really disproportionately picked the most unhealthy population they could, that was pretty advanced in age. And again, I think part of that was to say, look, we want to make sure that after seven years, we really know if there's a difference in these causes of death. The other thing is, this is kind of weird. Although again, I understand they're rational for it, but this is a great example of be very careful when you look at a clinical trial, that it remotely represents the patients you're interested in treating. So they also treated no patients who were symptomatic. The rationale being, if we include in the study, patients who are symptomatic, those who are randomized to placebo will drop out. Okay, I make sense in terms of study design, makes no sense if the study design is intended to mimic the real world. That's right. So now let's just keep track of the three issues. We have a disproportionately unhealthy patient population who are not symptomatic, and we're starting them more than 10 years after menopause. The next thing that they did, which again, I understand why they did it, but it's now the fourth strike against this study is, and I've spoken with the PI of the study and asked this question point blank, I'm actually going to have her on my podcast at some point soon to go over this in more detail. Is why did you use conjugated equine estrogen and MPA, which is a synthetic form of progesterone? Horse, yes. It's horse urine is like the collect horse urine, so they're getting the it's it's. It's, of course, is due urinate a lot or at least when they urinate it seems like a large volume of urine from what I observe. You have a lot of experience with it. No, but you know my sister road horses for a little while my high school girlfriend had a horse and that thing, I mean, the the the piece we're legendary. Male horse. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so the conjugated equine estrogen is the estrogen that's collected from from female horses, and then it says synthetic progesterone. And I said to to to to the person I said, well, why didn't you use what we use today, which is bio identical estrogen and progesterone like today. When we put women on estrogen, we use a it's an FDA product called the Vivalve dot, so it's a patch that you just put on and it's esteradial, but it's bio identical esteradial and we use what's called micronized progesterone, so bio identical progesterone. And she said. Well, at the time we just wanted to test what was currently being used, I said totally makes sense, but again, now you have four consensus. You have four considerations that you have to keep in mind. Okay, so despite those four considerations, and I'm going to make a case for you. Why I think the MPA created a real problem in that study, the synthetic progesterone. When the preliminary results were first made available, but not yet peer reviewed and not yet published there was a huge fiasco huge press announcement about it. And I'm suggesting that the women receiving the CEE plus MPA in the group with the uterus had a higher incidence of breast cancer. And that basically became the headline that never went away, though it turned out not to be true. Let's talk about the numbers. What was the increase in the risk of breast cancer in that group, which gets to my, one of my, if you know, you've ever listened to me on the podcast, rail on something. And I have about 3800 pet peeves and counting my laboratory staff know these, no good number of them. So you're all done. You do not want to apologize for having many pet peeves because as long as they have experience and data to support them, it provides. So one of my biggest pet peeves is, and my, my team knows this because sometimes they'll occasionally, you know, they'll do this and I'll have to remind them. You never talk about a relative risk change without an absolute risk accommodating it, right? So, so what does that look like? So the relative risk increase of breast cancer in the estrogen plus MPA group versus the placebo was 25, 27% and that became the only headline. HRT increases risk of breast cancer by 27%. Now, I don't think that's true at all today. But let's even look at the data. What was the ARR? What was the absolute risk increase? It was a difference between five cases per thousand and four cases per thousand. So the ARR was 0.1% one case in a thousand. And it's true going from four in a thousand to five in a thousand is a 25% increase. But it's a completely inappropriate context. I agree. And I feel like headlines of that sort which have come up recently around various dietary interventions, we will, though there at least for not for the time being, are nothing short of criminal because they really distort people's thinking, but also they steer the course of science and medicine for, as you pointed out, for decades, if not longer. And they can really take us off our health track in serious ways. So I'll bring this meandering to a close, which is to say, even though I could spend the next hour talking about all of the ways in which this study was flawed. And all of the very unethical things that were done by a number of the investigators who went out of their way to mask the truth of this study from the world. I'll tell a woman today. We're going to start you on this when you're going through menopause. We're using bio-identical hormones. And if you're upper bound risk of breast cancer is one case in a thousand, you should at least weigh that against all of the other benefits, which I'll talk about. Now, there's something else I want to say because a moment ago I alluded to the fact that I think the MPA might have been the biggest issue in that study. So there were two findings in that study that were negative. One was the small increase in the risk of heart disease and the small increase in the risk of breast cancer. But consider the other group. We forgot about the group that didn't have a uterus. Because remember, those women got estrogen only versus placebo. What was the difference in breast cancer there? Well, this is interesting because it didn't reach the testicle significance, but its p-value was 0.06 or 0.07. So it came very close, but it was in the opposite direction. It was a 24% risk reduction about 1 in a thousand as well. So when you had estrogen plus MPA, you had barely statistically significant. The p-value was 0.05, so it just hits the statistical significance. 1 in a thousand cases for breast cancer. And then you had 1 in a thousand cases, but p-value of 0.07 for reduction of risk of breast cancer. Which to me suggests that the MPA, the synthetic progesterone, was playing more of a role than anything else. The second thing I point out is oral estrogen, which we no longer use, does increase coagulability. It does increase the ability to blood to clot a little bit. And when we look at the more recent data on HRT using hoppical estrogen or patches of estrogen, we don't see that at all. So we see the opposite now. So now we see the risk of heart disease going down in women with estradiol. And some women will be arriving to those treatments with mutations and things like factor 5 light and in other clotting factors. Is it appropriate to say that everyone, both male and female should know whether or not they have mutin forms of factor 5 light. We don't typically test people for factor 5. My wife actually has it, but we didn't learn it until she had help syndrome, giving birth to our first daughter. But, you know, we kind of look for more family history reason to be testing things like that. We take a pretty detailed family history, so we'll kind of look for clotting issues there. We're about. So your reflex now is to put women on these top of us. Well, it's basically have the discussion, right? So here's where we still struggle, right? If it were up to me, I'd prefer for a woman's HRT to be provided by her GYN. Because we want to be able to work in partnership with the GYN who we would like to see an endometriol ultrasound done every year. That's, you know, somewhat argue that's overkill, but you know, we think she'd be shaving a pap smear every year as well. So if we're looking at the cervix, we want to look at the endometriol, we want to make sure the lining isn't too thick. The other thing I should say, Andrew, is today, we now realize that not all women can tolerate a predmig progesterone. So you have to be careful. So assuming again, a woman still has her uterus. The estrogen solves most of the problems, but then you have to decide, can she tolerate the progesterone? And it needs to be, if given, systematically, like 100 to 200 milligrams. And for some women, that is a life-saving intervention. I mean, they start sleeping better, their hair gets thicker, they feel better. But for some women, it literally drives them crazy. It's probably the reciprocal of what we were seeing in the case of women with PMS. So in those situations, we say, great, we're done with oral progesterone. We just use a progesterone coded IUD. So then you get the local progesterone in the uterus for protection and the systemic estrogen. Fascinating. What about oral contraception? For women, so the use of estrogen chronically through, you know, college years or 20-30s, maybe even teens who knows. What's known about the long term effects, Fanny? I gotta be honest with you, I don't think I know enough to comment on it. It's not something that really impacts my patient population. You know, at least in what I see more women are using IUDs for contraception than OCs. I mean, we use OCs sometimes in women who are pre-menopausal for symptomatic control, but we'll typically use like a low-low estrin. So a very low synthetic estrogen, which I don't like using these very much. But if it's the only thing that we can get to control certain symptoms and we'll use it like half per cycle. But it's typically not something we're that experienced with. What about testosterone? Because you mentioned that, you know, nanogram per mill. When you said everything to the same, I guess it's nanogram predestined. Is it would be to kind of normalize the protein? First of all, you can get your gram per mole. Right. Yeah. And so, you know, what Peter was pointing out before is that you look at your charts and they're all in these different measures. And so when you normalize testosterone is actually higher than estrogen and women that's a surprise to me. Do you prescribe testosterone therapy to women ever? We do sometimes, but I do it with much more caution because I don't have the data. Right. So where I'll, you know, what we'll say is look, I mean, we're now really outside of an area where I can point to a lot of data. Like when it comes to estrogen and progesterone, I'll happily go toe to toe with anybody who wants to make the case that it's dangerous. Similarly, when it comes to using testosterone and men, I'll spend all day and I can go through that literature until the other person cries and wants to just call uncle, right? When it comes to prescribes on testosterone. When it comes to estrogen and testosterone and women, don't have that data. And I'd love to see that trial done. So what's the, what's the sweet spot? How do we, how do we reconcile that? So it's not something I consider standard and basically if a woman is, for testosterone, first of all, is staggeringly low. And again, even though her testosterone is low compared to a male, we still have a range. So if it's really at the bottom of that range, she's really having difficulty putting on muscle mass and really complaining of low libido. I think in that situation, we'll go ahead and use topical testosterone. And, and you know, replace her to a level that is still physiologically normal. That's key because when people hear HRT, they think about super physiological. It seems to be the term. Yeah, like I've never seen a single symptom in a single woman that I've put testosterone on in terms of like acne body here, things like that. Like those are real symptoms that you have to be aware of. But, you know, like, literal enlargement and things like that, like that doesn't happen under physiologic normal conditions. I'd love to talk a little bit about one moment replacement therapy in men. When one looks on social media in the internet, there seems to be a younger and younger cohort of guys, people in their teens and 20s showing up to the table thinking that injecting testosteronecipient aid or taking anivar or whatever it is, is going to be a right idea. They're mainly seem to be focused on cosmetic effects. I'm not a physician, so I can't say whether or not they were actually have a gonadl, et cetera, but it seems to me. It seems to me that similar to the Tia's rule as it relates to longevity, that we could come up with a broad contour rule in which if a male of any age is not trying to get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, mining their social connections, et cetera, et cetera. The idea of going straight to testosterone is like a bad idea. That said, just like with depression and antidepressants, there is a kind of a cliff after which low enough testosterone or low enough serotonin prevents people from sleeping exercise, social connection, et cetera. So I do want to acknowledge that. But with that in mind, how do you think about, I'm perhaps occasionally prescribed and direct to your patients in terms of hormone replacement therapy in men, or send their 30s, person in their 40s, who's doing almost all the other things correctly, what sorts of levels do you think are meaningful, because the range is tremendous in terms of blood tests 300 nanograms for desoliter. I think on the low end now in the US all the way up to 900 or 1200, that's an enormous range. What are some of the other hormones you like to look at estrogen, DHT and so on? So, a lot of ton fact there. So, let's start with the ranges, right? So, the ranges you gave are for total testosterone, of course. And we don't spend a lot of time looking at that, the way we use the way we, you know, I used to spend more time looking at total and free when I had when I used more tricks to modulate it. So, I'm actually far more simple in my manipulation of testosterone today than I was six or seven years ago. Six or seven years ago, I mean, we were, you know, we would use a micro dose of anovar to lower SHBG in a person who had normal testosterone, but low free testosterone. What was a low dose of anovar in that context? 10 milligrams, subling, two to three times a week. And of our basically being DHT, it, it, oxandrolone. Yeah, exactly. And again, we're not recommending this. This is actually if you're playing a competitive sport, can get you banned from that. No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It can also get you banned from having children if you do it incorrectly. Yeah, so we're, a micro dose of this has to be small enough that it doesn't impair your body's ability to make testosterone. But anovar has such a high affinity for SHBG that it basically distracts your SHBG from binding your testosterone. Freeing up testosterone. That's exactly right. So the goal was, how do I just give you more free testosterone? So if patient shows up and they've got a total testosterone of 900 nanograms per deciliter, which would place them at, you know, depending on the scale you look at. So we look at that would place you at about the 70th percentile, but your free testosterone is, you know, eight nanograms per deciliter. So that's pretty bad. That means you're less than 1% free. A guy should be about 2% free tea. So that dude should be closer to 16 to 18 nanograms per deciliter. So in that situation that I just gave you, his SHBG is really high. His SHBG is probably in the 80 to 90 range. That's very high. Because I think the upper range is somewhere around 55, 56. Exactly. So we would first backstall for what's driving his SHBG. So there's basically three hormones. So genetics plays a huge role in this. There's no question that just out of the box people have a different, like set point for SHBG. Mine isn't credley low. It might as SHBG is like kind of in the 30s, 20s to 30s. But from a hormone perspective, there's basically three hormones that run it. So estradiol being probably the most important insulin and thiroxy. So we're going to look at all of those and decide if any of those are playing a role. So insulin suppresses it. So this is actually the great irony of helping a person get metabolic healthy. Is in the short run you can actually lower their free testosterone all things equal. Because as insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, and if testosterone hasn't gone up with it, you're lowering free testosterone. So somebody who goes on a very low carbohydrate diet and attempt to drop some water and drop some weight is going to increase their SHBG. After insulin goes up, testosterone, less free testosterone. I could tell the carnivore diet people are going to be coming after me with bone marrow in hand. But then again, after this discussion extends a little further, I'm sure the vegans will be coming after me with celery stalk. So it's the same as the estradiol. So except in the opposite direction. So higher estradiol is higher SHBG. So again, occasionally you'll see a guy with incredible testosterone, but he's a very high aromatece activity person. So he has a lot of the enzyme that converts testosterone into estradiol. You can lower estradiol a bit within aromatece inhibitor, and that can bring down SHBG. Now again, these things individually are rarely enough to move the needle. The last is thiroxine. So if you have a person whose thyroid is out of whack, you have to fix that. But if thir-t-4 is out of whack, you're going to interfere with SHBG. There are also some supplements which I think you've probably talked about these on the podcast. I feel like I've heard you talk about these on the podcast. Yeah, there are a few that will adjust. There is this idea. Now there's a much better review. It just came out. I'll send it to you. I'd love your thoughts on it. And I've been losing it line by line. But I love input. I'm experts like you on the use of Tonga Ali for reducing as hit. In my experience, it does free up some testosterone by which mechanism it isn't exactly clear. And the effects aren't that dramatic. Yeah. Right. They're probably multiple effects. For all we know it increases libido, and it does generally by waving, increasing estrogens, likely, which can also increase libido in some individuals. So we don't know the exact mode of actions. So we've talked about a few. The one that few years back, people were claiming could reduce SHBG was Steaming metals. Steaming metal. Well, I'll just, you're in seems to be cut. You're inating seems to be coming up multiple times on this podcast for whatever reason. Steaming metal extract. I took the the most pronounced effect of that was you could basically urinate over a car and when taking SHBG what the underlying mechanism of that was. I do not know. I took it for a short while it didn't drop my SHBG very much. But it did drop by DHT sufficiently. So then I stopped taking it. I do not like anything that imputes DHT. I don't care if my hairline retreats. I don't care about any of that DHT to me is something to be hooded and held onto because you feel so much better when your DHT is in the appropriate range. And I love your thoughts on that. Yeah, I get some point. It really depends on the guy and it depends on what risk you're trying to manage. Right. So prostate size starts to become one of the issues with DHT. Luckily, my prostate was again to generous low. And DHT, the things that I know can reduce it are things like finasteride, propitia, things like gastroenterate. Right. Things that people take to try to avoid hairloss can dramatically reduce DHT and lead all sorts of terrible sexual side effects, mood-based side effects, etc. But yeah, so I'm not aware of anything that can be taken in supplement form that can really profoundly drop. Yeah, we don't spend much attention on it anymore. Basically, I used to have a much more complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. I mean, it was, I would drive patients nuts with the whiteboard diagrams. I would draw for them when they end. I think they were just like, dude, just what do I need to take? Today we take a much more simple approach. So the first question is, should you or should you have your free testosterone being higher? That's the metric I care about. Is free testosterone is the first most important, the second most important is estradile. And sorry to interrupt, but you said, if you look at your total testosterone, you want the free T to be about 2% of your total. Well, it should be right now. So I might not change that anymore. So in other words, if a guy is at 1% then I know I have to really boost his total testosterone. If he's only going to get 1 to 1.5% of it converted to free, I need to boost him. And that's why I don't care if he's outside the range. Like, now I'll have a guy who's free T, I might have to get a guy's total T up to 1500 to get his free T to 18. I see, so free T is the target. I like to see his. And do you still use antibiotics? I'm saying, sure. Sorry to try and lower SHBG. It's because it's too potent. No, because it's too complicated for patients. You know, it's a drug that can't be taken orally, so you have to take it under the tongue, like, trot or something. Right. But then I had one patient once who even though we told him about 87 times that he was like, swallowing the anovars and his liver function. And he was like, we're talking 10 milligrams three times a week. Is it? How many does? And three months of him or whatever, two months of him swallowing that every time, triple, does liver function test. So it's like, it's just, I was like, you know, it's just not worth the hassle of doing this. For, you know, perfection in reality, we can fix this in other way. So, so the first order question is, do we believe clinically you will benefit from normalizing your free testosterone? We're taking it to a level that's called it 80th to 90th percentile. So upper normal limit of physiologic ranges. That's the first order question. And that's going to come down to symptoms. And that's going to come down to some biomarkers. I think there's two years ago or maybe a year ago. Very good study came out that looked at pre diabetic men. You probably talked about this study and looking at insulin resistance and glucose disposal within without testosterone. And the evidence was overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves glycemic control to testosterone improves insulin signaling. This shouldn't be surprising, by the way, given the role muscles play as a glucose or as a Ressive or on a glucose sink. So now I include that as one of the things that we will consider as a factor for using testosterone. Now, again, it's not the only one. So you can accomplish that with exercise, you can accomplish that with these other things. But then you get into a little bit of the vicious cycle of will having a normalized testosterone facilitate you doing those things better. So, let's just assume we come to the decision that this this person is a good candidate for testosterone placement therapy. The next question is what's the method we're going to do it? Are we going to do it indirectly or directly? Now, we used to use a lot of clomid in our practice. Have you talked about clomid on the talk? I talked too much about it. I know. We talked a little bit about the fact that some people taking things like an astrosol to reduce a romantic activity. Can potentially run into trouble because they think, oh, well, more testosterone good, lower estrogen, bad, and then they end up with issues like joint pain, memory issues and severe drops in libido. And I think a lot of the reason. And even a fat accumulation. So if estrogen is too low, you can develop at a positive in a way that you would otherwise. There's a great new one, then journal paper. It's probably 10 years old now that looked at five, I blew five different doses of testosteronecipionate. So these men were chemically castrated and divided into 10 groups. It's pretty remarkable. Somebody signed up for this study. Yeah. So you were with and without an astrosol and five doses of testosterone. So now you basically had five testosterone levels plus or minus high or low ester dial. And the results were really clear that the higher your testosterone and the more your ester dial was in kind of that 30 to 50 range, the better you were. So if estrogen was too low, even in the presence of high testosterone, the outcomes were less significant. And this is 30 to 50 nanograms, predestine or not 30 to 50 percent of your of one's testosterone. Okay, great. Okay. So we haven't talked, but clomid is, you know, we have not talked a lot about clomid. I'd love to get your thoughts on clomid. So clomophane is fertility drug. It's a synthetic hormone. It's actually two drugs. Mclonophane and I forget the other one. And it tells the pituitary to secrete FSH and LH. So the advantage of clomid is its oral. And it's meant to be taken orally. So, you know, a typical starting dose would be like 50 milligrams three times a week. And if you do that, you'll notice in most men, especially young men, FSHLH goes up. But if a man still has to stick you'll or reserve, he'll make lots of testosterone and response to that. Because that's the first order question we're trying to answer. Is your failure to make testosterone central or peripheral? Yeah. And I think I just want to point out again, correct me if I'm wrong. But my understanding is that a lot of the drugs that we're talking about, the synthetic compounds testosterone, estrogen, things related to growth hormone, etc. We're discovered and designed in order to treat and excuse me, in order to isolate and treat exactly these kinds of syndromes, whether or not it was the hypothalamus, the pituitary or the target tissue, the ovaries or the testies. Correct. Correct. Yeah. I mean, I think the easiest way to go about doing this is just give the hormone that's missing without attention to where the deficiency is. Why this becomes relevant is if you have a 35 year old guy who's testosterone is low, but you can demonstrate that it's low because he's not getting enough of a signal from the pituitary. Why would you bother giving him more testosterone when he has the capacity? He has the late Excel's and the subtoolie cells to make testosterone. He just needs the signal. Sometimes, they're not always just a course of clomid can wake him up. And he's back to making normal testosterone. So he'll do this three times a week, 50 milligrams, three times a week for a short course. Yeah. We would do it for eight to 12 weeks and then we reevaluate. And estrogen and testosterone will increase in parallel. Yes. And again, it depends. You know, a romantic activity is dependent on how much body fat you have and genetics. And if Estrodale gets too high, we think if it gets over about 5560, we will give micro doses of an astrosol. But it has to be real micro doses. I mean, you cannot pound people with an astrosol to give you perspective. The sort of on label use, like if you just go to a pharmacy and order an astrosol, you're going to get one milligram tablets. Like we can't give anybody a milligram. They'll feel like garbage. We have to have it compounded at 0.1 milligrams. And we might give a patient 0.1 2 to 3 times a week. That would be a big dose of an astrosol. Yeah. I think that the typical TRT clinic out there is giving 200 milligrams per male, 1 male, 200 milligrams of testosterone. And once every two weeks, and then hitting people with multiple milligrams of an astrosol, and they're all over the place. I've never really understood. I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but it's kind of blows my mind that these TRT clinics are up all over the place, given how bad. I mean, I see the results because I have patients that come from them. And I don't understand why they're so incompetent. I actually think it's worse than that. I think that they simply don't understand and don't care because it's a pill mill and it's a money mill. I think that nowadays it seems almost everybody who's doing TRT is taking lower doses more frequently every other day or twice a week, dividing the dose and being very, very careful with these estrogen or a romantic blockers. We most of our patients do not take a romantic inhibitors. It's not needed. It's really only the high aromatizers that need it. And so yeah, when we'll talk about testosterone, we'll talk about dosing there because I agree the more frequently you can take it the better. And frankly, you don't need to go more frequently than twice a week because it's so slow. The half life of the drug is, I think it's about three and a half days. It's the plasma half life or something like that. It could be off a little bit, but twice week dosing is really nice. So if you go to like testosterone clinic that's giving you 200 every two weeks, 50 twice a week is the same total dose, which by the way is a physiologic dose. So that's not going to give somebody any of the side effects you would see. You're not going to get acne with that. You're not going to get kind of comastia. You're not going to get anything. The only real side effect you get from that is you will get to stick in our atrophy. That's enough to suppress. Yeah, to maintain fertility, what do you typically do for? Well, so this is where, so I'll finish the story on Clamid because we currently do not use Clamid. And that's that's due to a really interesting observation that we, we made that I don't think has been reported in the long literature yet, which is that Clamid was increasing levels of a sterile that we also happened to measure called dysmosterol. I'm not familiar with that. So in the way that cholesterol is made, it's made by, there's two pathways that make cholesterol. So it starts with two carbons of, it's like a seedle co-way and it kind of marches down a pathway by forkates. And cholesterol is the finished product of both. But in one of those pathways, the molecule right before cholesterol is called dysmosterol and the other pathway is called Leithosterol. So we constantly measure Leithosterol and dysmosterol because we want to know how much cholesterol is being synthesized in the body, not just what your cholesterol is. We want to know how much cholesterol you reabsorb and those markers are really important to us when we're looking at cardiovascular disease risk. So when we gave patients Clamid, we were noticing a almost universal rise in their dysmosterol levels. Now the most obvious explanation for that though I, the last time I looked, I couldn't find clear explanation for this in any of the clinical, like the clinical trials that led to the approval of Clamid. So I don't know if it was described. In fact, maybe it wasn't known. I suspect it is inhibiting the enzyme, which I think is called Delta 24 desaturates that turns dysmosterol into cholesterol. Makes sense if you inhibit that enzyme, you're going to see a rise in dysmosterol. This wouldn't have been a concern to me if not for the fact that Tom Dayspring, who's one of the physicians we work with, who's one of the world's experts in lipids, pointed out a very obscure story, which was that the very first drug ever approved to treat cardiovascular disease. At least to treat hyperclusterolemia was a drug that attacked the same enzyme. So this, this was in the early 1960s, I believe, maybe the mid-60s. This drug was approved and it lowered cholesterol. And it was approved on the basis of lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug for ASCVD is approved on the basis of it lowering cholesterol. That's not a high enough bar. You have to reduce events. Except you show that you're preventing heart attacks and death. But at that time, it was like, hey, it lowers cholesterol. It's got to be good. Well, in the late 60s, it was pulled from the market because events were going up. So cholesterol was coming down. Events were going up. How could that be? We don't know. What we are suspecting is that dysmosterol, which is still a sterile, was potentially more damaging and created more oxidative stress in the endothelium. In the sub-inthelial space than cholesterol. I see. Which would at least suggest to us, and again, we're taking a lot of leaps here that maybe having high dysmosterol, very high dysmosterol is not a good thing. And so once we kind of pieced all that together a few years ago, we were like, yeah, we're just not going to prescribe climate anymore. And we then switched to HCG, which we used to use sometimes instead of climate, but it's more cumbersome to work with. It needs to be refrigerated. It's a much more fragile molecule. Yeah, I think we talked about this once. It's almost like if you accidentally knock over the little bottle, it's basically gone bad. Travel with it is very challenging with it. It's an needle. It's an injection, sub-cube. So easy to administer. It's not I am or anything like that, but it's just more of a hassle factor. But that said, it has the benefit that climate does, which is it preserves to particular function. It preserves to particular volume. So, you know, bodybuilders will often use this in their post-cycotherapy as a way to kind of recover function. And we would just use it now as ongoing therapy for a guy who still has to stick to reserve. So, on its own, no testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just so we had to crank out a bit more testosterone from the testes. Maybe some additional. Yes, and also HCG is a different model. HCG is just an analog of loot-nazing hormone. So it's basically like giving them loot-nazing hormone. So it's going to crush and dodge in a sleut-nazing hormone level, right? Because actually, yeah, and it, and it, and you don't really see much of an impact on LH, but you do see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, I correct that. Both FSH and LH will go down on a high enough dose. Yep. Just as I mentioned, and here I'm not making recommendations, but one supplement I've talked a lot about publicly as Fadogia Grestis, which is this weird Nigerian shrub that, that, You can do this on Tim's podcast. On Tim's podcast and Joe's podcast, and, you know, there was a bit of a backlash because it does turn out that it high doses in rodent studies. They can cause some toxicity to the testies, but at lower doses, it does seem to increase loot-nazing hormone. And after talking about this number of people went out there, did pre-imposed blood work, and the, the consistent effects seems to be an increase in loot-nazing hormone. There's a noticeable effect on test, testicular size and volume, so a lot of people will take this and they're like, oh, you know, they're balls are getting bigger, and so they get all excited that something good is happening. You don't know the long term safety and efficacy of something like Fadogia, whether or not needs to be psyched. Yeah, this is why I'm also very leery of the supplements in this space, because at least when we're using HCG or testosterone, like we have so many years of data. You have to remember how many women are using this stuff for reproductive medicine. So, you know, I think the FDI, the FDA has a lot of faults. I think I have an entire podcast devoted to the corruption of the FDA and all of the mistakes that have been made with respect to their oversight in especially generic drugs. But it's way more regulated than the wild wild west of nutty supplement land. Absolutely. I think that the reason we're talking about things like Tung out of Fadogia was to provide some intermediate discussion between doing all the correct things, but no supplementation or hormone therapy, and then going straight to hormone therapy. I don't want to like the leap from, I can't focus very well to riddle in, right, without a real diagnosis of ADHD to, oh well, maybe some things like alpha GPC low doses of nicotine, right, but I agree entirely. I mean, the sourcing is important, the dosages are worked out empirically on an individual basis, and there aren't randomized control trials, they're just aren't. Yeah, and you know, have kind of like a seven, this is another Peter principle, right, so I've got a lot of patients that come into the practice and you know, during our intake, we go through what drugs and supplements you're taking right now and a lot of people coming, I'm not taking anything Peter, I just you're in your in charge now, like tell me what you think. And then you get a lot of people that come in and they're like, we're going to need next to a few pages for this part of the document. So I give these patients a little homework exercise, which is you have to answer these seven questions for every supplement you take and here's this spreadsheet and let's talk about it. And it basically just runs through like, you know, it's it's basically walking you through the logic of why do you take this molecule and. I think for many people, it's when they do that, it's very sobering, right, they kind of a lot of them will come back and be like, you know what. I don't think I can come up with any reason along this really rigorous line of thinking is to why I'm taking 80% of this stuff. And why know people and actually we know someone the same people were fanatic about like red life red light on the testes, sunning their testes. Putting ice packs on their testes, it's kind of all over the place the number of things that people are trying and doing in order to increase testosterone out, but from their testes is pretty remarkable and that said. Among some of the women I know the number of things that they're doing to try and promote longevity and fertility and in particular skin health, hair health and nail health. Is also kind of outrageous everything from collagen to red light therapies, which may actually have some efficacy in certain cases, but. As an interest there's a higher there right for sure. One of the things that I hope gets a lot more attention is the use of rap a mice and for preserving a very in health. So the animal literature on this is pretty impressive right so in mouse models rap a mice and will preserve a of a of a of a very in life. And so it makes sense right I mean it totally makes sense why the most potent geroprojective molecule we have would also preserve an extend ovarian life at least in mice so. I'd love to see the clinical trials done in in women to test this hypothesis. I definitely want to come back to this because it's a key thing I know the lot of people are just in female fertility out there and going in their male partners so. Going back to so now I understand why you don't prescribe chromophene because of this this monster all potential this monster all link. What about testosterone therapy so less so frequent lower doses less or no estrogen inhibition or a romantic inhibition only a we're only using an aromatase. And we use a rimitex when we do it's just to get that estradiol into the range we want I like to see it between 30 and 50 that that that's the sweet spot and. I don't know I would say like a third maybe a. How do you even a third I'd say probably 20% of men require a micro dose of an astrosol to get into that range most do not. And I'd rather air on the side of being a little high than a little low so I never really want to be below 25 if unless sometimes it's just below 25 and it is it is what it is that's fine but but if we're suppressing it to below 25 I never want to be in that zone. And then yes, so T RT is ultimately you know giving testosteronecipionate is usually what we use injectable so it's supposed to creamer pellet correct. And then you use to use pellets with women. For some who are really adamant about the convenience of it but for a bunch of reasons I just I'm mostly not doing that and I've never been a fan of pellets in men. Can't control the dosage once it's in right know the dose yeah that's obviously a problem but I don't think there's a big difference in putting a pallet into a man and a woman so when you're putting an estrogen pallet into a woman it's like. That big when you're putting enough pellets into a man for six months of testosterone it's two sums of pellets that are longer than my finger so you're putting like a V shape putting this you're putting it into the gluteal fat. So it's just it's just a more morbid procedure and I don't think it's necessary I think if you if you know how to manage it you know through through sort of the injections and now. Yeah, well, especially now if you're doing you know we're having them do sub cue injections anyway so it's not I am they're using five eight cents to a one inch 25 gauge needle which is about the smallest needle you can push the oil through. Once the twice a week depending on and by the way if they're real needle fobs we use ziostead which is a preloaded pen. And are you having all men take H.C.G to maintain fertility and totally. We don't like to use testosterone specifically and men who still want to maintain fertility we just steer them away from that because total sperm count goes to yeah we just say why risk it like we'd rather use H.C.G. Just on itself. Just wait till you're done reproducing thanks for wait till you're done reproducing before we go to testosterone. What are some of the benefits and what are some of the cautionary notes with appropriate TRT meaning of the kind of contour that we're talking about here a lower dose with the yes or no low estrogen control. People what it generally people report how do they feel what is it allowed them to do that they couldn't do or feel before and then in terms of what are the markers to look for is it LDL what pressure water retention acne those kinds of things are there some other things. And then we're using these really low doses so it's pretty rare that we have a patient on more than a hundred milligrams a week of testosterone. I think for comparison like a body builder could easily take 500 to 1000 during a high growth phase. And then some of these guys they go ballistic or they're doing moderate levels of testosterone subunit but they're also taking Diana ball xanodrolone. You know, sarms and a bunch of other things I mean their stacks are kind of ridiculous I mean not notice or expected that sport but I mean people are just in like crazy in that sports right outside of physiology. And I think for 99% people listening they just they look with a here body builder and they just like why would somebody do that anyway right I think that's the tip of the point is a lot of but we owe those guys a great deal of gratitude because they've shown us the boundaries including the women that's right. Yeah, yeah and so so those those those body builders have taught us a lot about like what happens and so yeah the the bloating the water retention acne hair loss hair growth all of those things we understand the truth of it is we just don't see those things in our patients. But 100 milligrams per week is a very low output minor. But it's a physiologic does me really it's enough for those people I mean there's probably the highest we've ever had to go is maybe 70 twice a week. What's the youngest patient you've ever had to put on TRT actual testosterone. Mm-hmm. Probably I'd ask you a question about maybe maybe maybe 40. I think that's great for people to hear because I know that a lot of guys in their 20s are thinking TRT's the way to go and I would argue less you're doing everything else right and you're still hypergonat on your really struggling. Put that put that time off because also the fertility issue you wanted to lay to. Well again it depends if when we say TRT if you're in your 20s and there's no other way I would I would hope you would be steered toward H.C.G. to at least preserve to particular function now again we don't actually know if after being on H.C.G. for 10 years you are pituitary will still work right you won't be able to make your own route. Exactly so so it might be the case that you're going to need something upstream of that like clomid to kickstart it and then we're but again I thought I don't want anybody who's listening to this who's using clomid for fertility to think that there's anything wrong with I was my concern over this became like if you're going to be on this for 10 years is it problematic not if you're using this for a course. If you're using this for a course of IVF or something like that so so again if if if we felt that someone's pituitary was not working I would be happy to put three months of clomid on them to kind of try to see if we could blast it back. Do you have men cycle on and off testosterone at these low doses? Are they taking a month vacation from it? Totally depends you know it's talking to patient yesterday where we're going to do we just decide to change it cycle eight weeks on then eight weeks on H.C.G. So that's going to be a cycle that maintains his testosterone level but fluctuates between endogenous exogenous endogenous exogenous sometimes we'll just do testosterone on off on off and there it's like how much can he replenish naturally but understanding his T will dip during those off cycles. It seems to me there's a tremendous incentive for somebody to develop a molecule that can directly target SHBG besides Oxand who ran animal right if you one could just drop a SHBG just the tiny as bit seems like one could adjust the free tea. And in a way that would be great I don't know why that molecule so hard to target but somebody ought to do it chemistry can't be that hard. I talked with Patrick Arnold about this many many years ago. I wish I could remember what his idea he had a comment about this that at the time made sense and I don't remember what it was because I had that thought to like man. Especially for that subset of guys who have normal testosterone that they're just overbinding it. I'm really glad that you brought up this issue of total testosterone versus free tea and the reason is ever since going on podcast and talking about this stuff and time on this podcast. People will send me their numbers they'll send me their charts and then they'll send photos of themselves and I can tell you while I'm not a clinician and I haven't done fancy statistics on it. There's very little correlation between someone's absolute testosterone and how they appear. I mean, somebody's guys look you know really lean really strong and they'll say oh total testosterone is 550. 480 right and then other people you know testosterone is 860 but they you look at them and you think oh they kind of got to kind of a doughy look to them and so it's got to be this free testosterone. I was estrogen etc. I was also trading and nutrition too. I mean I just think I think for all this talk about testosterone which I enjoy talking about and you know I enjoy talking about the data on you know long-term health consequences of testosterone because it's another controversial topic. I also think people kind of overstated importance. I agree. I think there's a there's a there's a group of people who think if I could just fix my testosterone everything will be better and it's sort of like. No actually that's not true at all really the only purpose in my mind of fixing testosterone is to give you the capacity to work harder. It's really going to help you recover more from your workouts this should just give you a greater ability to experience muscle protein synthesis. So you know if I just give you a bunch of testosterone and you sit on the couch and your nutrition doesn't change and you're not exercising anymore you're not going to experience any benefits of this thing. I mean my testosterone level has fluctuated quite a bit throughout my life and when I think about as an adult not not sort of including when I was sort of a fanatical teenager but as an adult when was I at my absolute most insane physique like my best performance on a dexascan would have been. 30 of 38 years old by dexa I was 7% body fat my fat free mass index was like 23.2 23.3 kilograms per meter squared I mean I was. Huge strong and totally ripped my testosterone was in the toilet I was overtraining like crazy I was you know exercising probably 26 hours a week. Killing it in the gym swimming like a banshee cycling like my life depended on it grossly over trained low T but you know I mean physically looked like twice the guy I am today you know today my T's probably twice as high as it was then so. Now you could say well Peter what if you look T back then how much better could you have been sure but but again I think the take home is. just giving somebody T doesn't do much of anything it probably helps on the insulin resistance front without any other thing but to me that's a waste like that's swandering the gift that it is giving you which is the ability to do more work. work and you know, capture the benefit of it via muscle proteins synthesis. I agree and I think that the psychological effect of testosterone, whether or not it's exogenous or endogenous, is it makes effort feel good. Yeah. At some level, it really seems to do that. And Sapolsky tells me the main reason or mechanistically the main reason that it can do that is by adjusting levels of activity in the amygdala. And so they're some interesting imaging there. I'd love to chat more about the cholesterol pathway. And I know this is a huge landscape as well, but I think we're doing a good job of diving in deep, but not getting stuck in the underlying currents at all. There's tremendous debate about whether or not dietary cholesterol directly relates to or does not relate to serum cholesterol LDL and HDL. Here's my answer. Well, let me put it this way. There are people that argue, I'm certainly not arguing. There are people that argue that if one eats a ton of saturated fat that LDL goes up in HDL. Oh, I know. Okay, but that's not dietary cholesterol per se. No, not dietary cholesterol per se. And then there are people that argue that, you know, any increase in saturated fat intake is going to be bad that you already synthesize enough cholesterol for hormone production, et cetera. I'd like to talk about this in terms of how one should read their charts. My LDL is in what I'm told is healthy range. My HDL is in no-one's healthy range. I do try not over eat things like butter, cheese, and red meat, but I do eat some of those things and I feel pretty good. But most people are operating under the assumption that eating saturated fat is bad and you only do it in so far as you want to taste it. And then of course there's a small group of people that love to eat organs and meats and really pack cholesterol and would argue that doesn't matter if your LDL is eight, seven, the is not going to impact your health. What's the reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated fat, at least in your view? So first let's differentiate between cholesterol and fat just for the listener because we use them, I don't want to make sure people understand. So cholesterol is a really complicated molecule. So it's a ringed molecule. God, I used to know exactly what its structure was. But it could have 36 carbons for all I remember. It is a lipid, so it is a hydrophobic molecule that is synthesized by every cell in the human body. It is so important that without it, if you look at sort of genetic conditions that impair cholesterol synthesis, depending on their severity, they can be fatal in utero. So in other words, anything that really interferes with our ability to produce cholesterol is a threat to us as a species. And the reason for that is cholesterol makes up the cell membrane of every cell in our body. So as you know, but maybe the listeners don't, even though a cell is a spherical thing, it has to be fluid. It's not just a rigid sphere, like a blow up ball. It's got to be able to move in this way to mesh with other cells. It also has to accommodate having porous structures that traverse its membrane to allow ions and things like that to go across. It's cholesterol that gives the fluidity to that membrane. It's also as you're alluding to the backbone of some of the most important hormones in our body, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol. So we have this thing. Super important. Okay. Then let's talk about, can you get cholesterol in your diet? Yes, you can eat foods that are rich in cholesterol. But was known in 1960, but somehow escaped everybody's imagination until finally the American Heart Association acknowledged this a few years ago, is that the cholesterol you eat does not really make it into your body. And the reason for that is it's a terrified. So we have, and not to get too nerdy, but I think people, I think if I really think it's important people understand how this thing works. So we have cells in our gut and innerocytes that they're the endothelial cells of our gut. They have, each one of them has basically two transporters on them. So the first is called the Neimanpix C1-like one transporter. The second is called the ATP binding cassette G5GA. Okay. The Neimanpix C1-like one transporter will bring in any sterile cholesterol, zoo sterile, phytosterol, any sterile that fits through the door will come in. Actually all of that is the cholesterol we produce that gets taken back to the liver, that the liver packages in bile and secretes. So that's what AIDS in our digestion, which is another thing I should have mentioned earlier. In addition to using cholesterol for cell membranes and hormones, we wouldn't be able to digest our food without cholesterol because it's what makes up the bile salts. So our own cholesterol is basically recirculated in a pool throughout our body and this is the way it gets back into the body. It's through this Neimanpix C1-like one transporter. But it gets in there, the body, this is the checkpoint of regulation. This is where the body says, do you have enough cholesterol in the body? Yes or no. If yes, I will let that cholesterol make its way into the circulation. So it'll go off the base allateral side of the cell, not the lumenal side into the body. Alternatively the body says, you know what, we have enough cholesterol. I'm going to let you poop this out and now the ATP binding cassette will shoot it out. It'll go back into the lumenal side in a way it goes. So all of the cholesterol on our body is not a sterified and it doesn't have that big bulky side chain attached to it. The cholesterol you eat is a sterified and an a sterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass through that Neimanpix C1-like one transporter. We probably manage to de-esterefize 10 to 15% of our dietary cholesterol. So in other words, there are small amounts of dietary cholesterol that do make their way into our circulation. But it represents a small fraction of our total body's pool of cholesterol. Again, this was known even by Ansel Keys, the guy who turned fat into the biggest boogie man of all time, Ansel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol. Again, it took the American Heart Association another 60 years to figure that out. But even now they acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol has no bearing. So why is it that it's pretty easy to find studies or at least people with who are highly credentialed from good institutions claiming that eating saturated fat? That's different. Saturic fat read meat. Things that are rich in cholesterol to be more specific is bad for us in terms of our vential LDL. So this is two different things. So saturated fat consumption in many people will raise LDL cholesterol. So it's important to differentiate between what is saturated fat. So saturated fat, of course, is a fatty acid. Just so people understand, totally different molecule from cholesterol. It's very complicated. Ring, structured, multiple rings stuck together. SFA saturated fat is just a long chain fatty acid that is fully saturated. Meaning it has no double bonds. And it can exist in isolation. It can exist in a triglyceride, try a so glyceride. Or a phospholipid or all sorts of things like that. So when we eat foods that contain fat, basically there are three distinctions for that fat. Is it saturated? Is it mono-unsaturated? One double bond. Or is it polyunsaturated? Two or more double bonds. The observation that eating saturated fat raises cholesterol is generally correct. But again, now it makes, because if we're going to start talking about LDL, we have to explain what LDL is. This is another one of those things that's just so grossly misunderstood that it's, it makes having discussions about this very complicated. Let's go back to the cholesterol problem. Rates of every cell in our body makes cholesterol. And almost without exception, they make enough. There are a handful of times, however, when a cell needs to borrow cholesterol from another cell. Okay, so how would you do this? So if you're playing God for a minute and you want to design a system, you have to be able to transport cholesterol from one cell to another. The most logical place you would transport this is through the circulation. And the problem with circulation is its water. Plasma is water. So now you have this problem, which is I want to transport cargo that is hydrophobic in a hydrophilic medium. Can't do it. So if you think about all the things that we transport in our blood, sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, they're water soluble. It's easy. They just move back and forth in our blood with no chaperone. But when you want to move cholesterol, you have to package it in something that's hydrophilic. That's something is called lipoprotein. So we have these spherical molecules that are lipid on the inside, protein on the outside, lipoprotein. And inside, they contain cholesterol and triglycerides. So now you've got this spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol on the inside, and it's chaperone by a hydrophilic molecule that allows it to move through our circulation. And those lipoproteins exist in different densities. So if you run these out on a gel, electrophoresis plate, you'll identify different densities. The density is a function of how much protein and how much lipid is in it. So the highest density of this is called a high density lipoprotein. And the lowest density of this is called a very low density lipoprotein, a VLDL. And then next to that you have an LDL, a low density lipoprotein. And then next to that you have an ideal and intermediate density lipoprotein. So it actually goes VLDL ideal, I'll deal with it anyway. So when people say my LDL is high or my LDL is 100, what are they saying? They're saying the cholesterol concentration of my LDL particles is 100 milligrams per deciliter. So the total cholesterol concentration you have in your circulation is that number that says total cholesterol. So if someone's blood panel says my total cholesterol is 200, it means that if you take all the lipoproteins in their circulation bust them open and measure the cholesterol content, it's 200 milligrams per deciliter. And for all intents and purposes, because the ideals are so that's basically the sum of your LDL cholesterol, your VLDL cholesterol and your HDL cholesterol. Those three things sum to your total cholesterol. What about LDL little a that you mentioned during LP little a's another statement? Yeah, he's another actor. He is a special type of LDL that again, in sort of 10 to 20% of the population is a really bad actor. So that's an LDL that has another apolipropotein on it called apolipropotein little a. The other thing I'll just say on this because earlier I mentioned apob, there are two broad families of lipoproteins. There are those that are wrapped in apob's and those that are wrapped in apo a's. The apo a family is the HDL family. The apob family is the VLDL ideal LDL family. I see. So for somebody who, let's say their total cholesterol is, let's just stay with 200 or some plasticity. What do you like to see in terms of the HDL LDL ratio? Couldn't care less. I only care about apob. I only care about apob. I care about the causative agent of atherosclerosis. Apob is the thing that drives atherosclerosis. And what levels are attractive or repulsive for you when you see levels of apob that are blank? You get really concerned. What depends on the person's objectives? So again, we take a very different view. I mean, we have vitality now, lived and I want to live to be 100. Yeah, if you're having some tape. If you tell me you want to live to be 100, you're going to need to keep your apob below 30 milligrams per desolator. Let's say I want to live to be 100, but I also, well, how about I don't care how long I live, but I want to feel great while I live. Again, it depends, right? Like anybody who's had a heart attack is going to be compromised in their ability to feel well after. Right. So I guess I point, I make say that way because if you're going to tell me that in order to achieve that, live to a hundred level, I'm going to have to give up my personal life and my, no, no, my, my brain functioning, then I'm not really interested. Sure, but to get LDL levels and really, again, people think of it as LDL. It's really apob, right? ApoB is this total concentration of LDL and VLDL. And that's what matters. Those are the big anthropogenic particles. LDL also includes the LP little A. Although the concentration of LP little A is relatively speaking so small that it doesn't generally show up as much in the apob. So we treat apob and basically what it comes down to is you want apob to be as close to the level as it was when you were born. So we start developing heart disease when we're born. That's just the way it is. The autopsy studies make this abundantly clear. When you look at autopsy's of young people who were dying in their 20s and this was first done in the 1970s, it was again repeated. Again, it's always done after we have a war, right? So in the 1970s it was done on people, you know, who died in Vietnam. In the early 2000s it was done on mostly young men, but sung young women who were dying in Iraq and Afghanistan. And we saw without any ambiguity, the cardiovascular disease is already taking hold in people who were 18, 19, 20 years old. And to be clear, they aren't going to die of atherosclerosis at that age. There's still 40, 50 years away from it, but this is a lifelong disease. And we also know that the disease can't really develop until apob reaches a certain threshold. And that's the threshold that most of us get to by the time we're, you know, sort of in our teens. So it's this really young apob level of kind of 20 to 30 milligrams per desolator that makes it impossible to get atherosclerosis. So apob is necessary, but not sufficient to develop a, cvd. Now that, go ahead. Oh, I'm sorry. I was just going to ask what are some of the top behavioral nutritional supplementation if any, based and prescription drug based ways to target apob. Well, nutritionally, you basically have two big ghouls, right? And it depends on what's driving up apob. So apob, remember, is the concentration of LDL and VL DL particles. And what do they carry? cholesterol and triglycerides. So anything that reduces cholesterol and reduces triglycerides is going to reduce apob. Triglycerides are generally driven by carbohydrate intake. So more insulin resistance, more carbohydrate intake, more triglycerides. So we, I mean, clinically, this is readily apparent to anyone who treats patients. If you restrict carbohydrate, you will reduce triglycerides. That, that just happens all day long. But if you reduce triglycerides by raising fat intake so much, it can still raise apob. So, so you have to be able to think about it. So, so in an ideal world, it's, can you lower saturated fat, which tends to be the one that is most driving apob while lowering carbohydrate and then see what you can get. But here's the reality it is. There's nobody with dietary intervention that's going to get to a level of 30 milligrams per desoliter. I mean, I've never seen any of these dietary intervention. Yeah. So what are the other things? It's got to be pharmacologic at this point. Statent type, but interrelationship. You have multiple classes of drugs. So the tried and true is the statin. So statins work by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis. And the net effect of that is that the, so the liver is really sensitive to cholesterol levels. It doesn't want too much. It doesn't want too little. When you inhibit cholesterol synthesis, the liver says I want more cholesterol. So it puts more LDL receptors on its surface and it pulls the LDL out of circulation. That's what lowers the LDL in the circulation. So, again, nine statins in use today, we typically use four of them. The side effect profile contrary to all the sort of statin hating propaganda out there, very benign. Right? 5% of people experience muscle soreness, which reverses upon cessation. You know, cognitive effects. Again, I think it's in terms of actual comparing it in a placebo. No effect whatsoever. Right? So does that mean that you put a patient on it? They won't complain of something. No. But if you look at clinical trials, there's no evidence whatsoever that's statins in pair of cognition. There's also no evidence in clinical trials that they accelerate the risk of neurodegenerative disease. In fact, it's the opposite. Now, we, there's a, there's a, there's a very nuanced case we make, enter, which is we'll look at patients with highly suppressed desemostral levels. We will back off. We, we do want to maintain desemostral above a certain level because of some evidence that is still, I think, very preliminary, but enough for us that we say, why take the chance? We have so many other tools to lower cholesterol. Why would we over suppress synthesis in a susceptible individual? So the next tool you look at is a drug that blocks the absorption or the reabsorption of cholesterol. Remember that Neiman Pixie, one like one transporter? So that guy has a drug called azetamide that just mechanically blocks it. So in people, and that's I mentioned earlier, we measure all those sterols in people. So we also measure things called phytosterols. And the phytosterols give us an indication of how active that transporter is. So the higher your phytosterols, the more likely we're to respond to zedamide. Next class of drugs is a drug that blocks cholesterol synthesis, but only in the liver. So the statin does it globally. The, this other drug called benbedoic acid does it only in the liver. So it has a very similar mechanism to statins, different enzyme, not quite as potent, but way fewer side effects. So any patient that's having a response to statins that's adverse will try this other thing. What's called one more time? Benbedoic acid. Benbedoic acid. The most potent drug of the lot is the PCSK9 inhibitor. So PCSK9, it's a protein that was discovered in the late 90s I believe is responsible for the degradation of LDL receptors. This was first discovered in people who had a condition called familial hyperclastrolemia or FH. So these are people that have incredibly high cholesterol. Typically, their cholesterol level is 300. Their LDL cholesterol is typically, you know, north of 200 milligrams per desolator. This is a disease that is defined by the phenotype, not the genotype. So the phenotype has a very clear definition, which I basically just gave you. The genotype is there's a million paths to get there. There's over 3000 mutations that are known produce that phenotype. This was discovered to be one of them. In people who had hyperfunctioning PCSK9, this protein was just constantly hammering and destroying the LDL receptors. And so their LDL would be huge. And by extension, their total cholesterol would be. So in 2006, Helen Hobbs and colleagues discovered an opposite group of population. People who had LDL cholesterol naturally have 10 to 20 milligrams per desolator, which would be an APOB of about 20 milligrams per desolator. And who never got heart disease? They were immune to heart disease. No matter how long they live. And they had the opposite. They had hypofunctioning PCSK9. And so that was 2006, the New England Journal of Medicine, that basically got a whole bunch of drug companies, hot on the trail of producing a drug to mimic it. So now we have these antibodies. And they're wildly effective. What percentage of your patients over 45 do you have on either a statin or on one of these other hospitals? Often it's in combinations. And I would say 80%. We have to remember what our objective is. Like we're in the business of trying to make sure people live as long as possible. And you have to take a sort of worldview of this. Right? If you like what's the most prevalent cause of death globally? Is it cardiovascular disease? Yeah. And how close is it? So the last year before COVID kind of messes up these numbers a little bit. But if you go to 2019, 18.6 million people died of heart disease. Number two, cancer, 10 million. Like nothing is in the zip code of atherosclerosis. And if you remember what I just said, if you, if you had, if you took everybody in their 20s and reduced them to a level of that of a child, you'd make a CPD and orphan disease. So the question I don't want you to do more. Why don't we hear more about this? I realize there's some nuance. It's not straightforward. It's not as simple as saying, eat less cheese, red meat, and watch your LDL get on a statin. But why do we hear so little about apobie in the general discussion? Social media is such a skewed landscape as we know people shouting into tunnels of wearing clarity. You know, some are beautiful, bronze tunnels with clean walls and others or sewer lines. And they all converge in the same place as we know. But why do we hear so little about this? I mean, I'm not on a statin, but now I'm beginning to think that maybe that might be a good idea to consider one of these other compounds. I don't know the last time I looked at my apobie specifically. I'm guessing my physician did. But why don't we hear more about this? This is the sound so important. It sounds like the most important conversation because all the hormone stuff and all the stuff about smoking and head injuries and ADHD and all the rest, I mean, is irrelevant if you're dead. Yeah. It's a good question. I don't think I have a great insight as to why this isn't more front and center. I think the bigger problem is why don't we even understand how to think about it? I mean, and there's a whole chapter in my book I'm working on that really gets to this problem of why aren't we looking at a thrust grosses in terms of treating the causative agent instead we look at modifying tenure risk? So that's the fundamental difference between what I call medicine 2.0 and medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, which is what we're generally practicing today. When it comes to ASCBD says, like, we will treat you. We will lower that LDL cholesterol. They still don't talk about apobie, but that's a very American thing. If you go outside of the United States, everybody's talking about apobie. It's in the guidelines in Europe and Canada everywhere else. The United States is very stubborn on this and it's due to a couple of really weird personalities in the lipid world. But the paradigm is when your tenure risk reaches 5%. And there's a 5% chance that you're going to have a heart attack stroke or die in the next 10 years now it's time to treat you. Medicine 3.0 says, that's not the way to think about it. You treat the causative agent. If there's a causative agent, you treat it. If blood pressure raises the risk of heart disease, you lower blood pressure. If smoking raises the risk of something you treat smoking. The reason that the risk model is so bad when you're looking at 10 year risk is age is the biggest drive risk. If you take a 70 year old with perfect lipids and perfect blood pressure and perfect everything, the 10 year risk of ASCBD is probably 4 to 5 times higher than the most unhealthy 30 year old. It's not even close. There's a lot like I disease. There are exceptions of course. We always say the biggest risk factor for going blind from glaucoma is being an older person. Frankly. Right. So if you could identify what the risk factors are for glaucoma, imagine if the paradigm was we're only going to treat it when your risk of blindness reaches 5%. Which isn't triggered until you're old enough anyway. Wouldn't you rather know that when you're 30 and say, wait, if maybe being in the sun without sunglasses or using this type of eyedrope or something like that has a negative impact, I would rather know that sooner. So that's the fundamental difference. It's a philosophical difference with respect to prevention. And I will acknowledge that in one element of prevention, I make no consideration. I am only coming at this through the lens of the individual. I am never coming at this through the lens of society. That makes my life easier and it makes the problem I'm solving easier. I don't have to answer the quality adjusted life your problem. I don't have to ask the question, is it economical to treat people at 30? I don't know the answer that question. But I also know that when you're trying to solve really complicated problems, the more you can simplify the better. So I've just acknowledged openly not solving that. If you want to criticize me for it, that's fine. Let's be transparent. But all I care about is the person I'm sitting across from. And in that situation, it's really their decision if they can justify the cost of treatment. An esoteric question and then a less esoteric question. The esoteric question relates to something that I think is a little bit niche, but not necessarily so, which is peptides and stem cells in PRP. I don't want to go off on too much of a tangent on rehab, but I know you've done a number of posts on social media recently that we're, I have to tell you, I really thought full and I really appreciate that you're willing to share your own tissue rehabilitation experience and point people that because this is a landscape that a lot of people are in and they don't know how to navigate it. And a mutual friend of ours not to be named sent me a text and said, I'm going to be talking to a Tia and what do you know about studies on things like BPC-157, this gastric peptide that anecdotally, again anecdotally, people report getting injections of this into shoulder knee, et cetera, and feeling so much better, so much faster, but there really aren't good studies, controlled studies. And you hear all the same sorts of things about like the rich plasma PRP, which someone tells you they're a lot of stem cells in them, they're lying, they're not a lot of stem cells in them. And you hear also you're about stem cells, which are not FDA approved, at least in this, you know, for most uses in this country, but are certainly people are flying down to Colombia and getting injections. And what is your understanding or experience with things like BPC-157, specifically, because peptides is a huge landscape, we should probably do a whole episode of them, peptides. Things like PRP, PRP is now approved for, I mean, women are getting injections of this into their ovaries to improve a fall-clecum. We know this, people are getting injections of PRP into every tissue and organ in it, help men are getting injected into their penis, so I hear for all sorts of reasons that are unclear to me. What's the deal with PRP, BPC-157, and stem cells? Do you ever see interesting effects? Are you curious about these compounds? Do you prescribe or direct people towards these? The FDA approved ones. Yeah, so short answer is I'm definitely curious about them, and I'd love to see the work done, but I also think this is about as wild wild west as it gets. PRP less so, but certainly stem cells and peptides. And, you know, I just think, if you're going to do something without a clinical trial, you got to show up with a lot more data. Right? So let's use RAPA mice and as an example, right? I'm a huge proponent of RAPA mice, and you can say what Peter, how can you take or prescribe RAPA mice and for zero protective effects when we do not have a human clinical trial demonstrating that it lengthens life? And the answer is because I have 84 other pieces of data that all point in the same direction across every model organism going back more than a billion years. And that's really different from Joey, Sammy, and Sally did this thing, and I think it works. And they just can't be compared. Now, I have no idea if stem cells work. I have no idea if BPC157 works. I have no idea, frankly, if PRP even works, though it might seem to have some efficacy in some indications. For example, maybe when it comes to early hair loss, maybe when it comes to certain joint issues. But the reality is, like, I think we just have to accept the fact that everything we do has an opportunity cost. And that opportunity cost is sometimes financial. But I actually find a lot of times it's in time and effort and energy that goes into something. Now, when I was, you know, waiting to get my shoulder surgery, this is an injury that I've had forever, right? This is an injury. This injury was actually probably the greatest source of discomfort I had swimming in the past 2000, so that's the tells you how long I've had this injury. But, you know, I sort of knew at some point, like, I'm going to have to have it fixed. And I sort of went down this rabbit hole, like, hey, is there anything I can do to avoid having surgery, you know, with, with, infusing a million stem cells into it work. And in speaking with, there's many orthopedic surgeons as I could, the answer was kind of unambiguously now. And by the way, it doesn't mean you wouldn't feel better if I injected a bunch of stem cells into your shoulder. There are a lot of reasons that might make you feel better, just like there are a bunch of reasons you can feel better if somebody injects saline directly into your joint. So, so the, the question is, is it going to fix the underlying problem? And if so, will it do so by what mechanism? So, I'm pretty sure that if you took a thousand people with my particular injury and injected them with stem cells, it wouldn't do a thing because of the nature of my injury at a completely liberal tear. Are there some injuries that might benefit from it? Yeah, possible. So, the question is, how would you design the trial to narrow down your patient population correctly so that you might see a signal? Because the other risk of doing a trial is you have too much of a heterogeneous patient population. It's, you don't know what the heck you're really doing. And you get meaningless results. You get a null result when in fact, there's a small signal, but you were underpowered to pick it up because, you know, you only had 10% of your patient population that was the right patient population to get that. So, you know, will we ever get there? I don't know because I don't see what the incentive is, right? You have people who are making money hand over fist doing procedures on the basis of, I'm not sure what, what would their motivation or incentive be to sort of see this legitimized? You'd really have to be able to say, well, there really needs to be sort of a pharma angle to this. It's sort of one of the wishes I had, right? Like if I was a billionaire, I feel like the way I would probably waste all of my money would be running clinical trials on stuff nobody cared about. Yeah. It might just like, I was. I would join you because that would be yesterday we recorded a sit down with somebody from Caltech who works on aggression and rage and things and other things related to that and has identified peptides that are approved, the FDA for other reasons that seem to adjust anxiety, might even adjust aggression and pathologic aggression. And when often to a long description of why none of these drugs exist on the market for the treatment of psychiatric illness and yet probably would work. And what's missing is a billionaire or a billion dollar company that is willing to invest in something that very likely will work, but the market value isn't quite there or it failed in a previous trial and so no one wants to touch it with a ten foot pole. Hopefully someone will see this will be incentivized to provide this sort of venue for that kind of work that we're talking about. I have to ask. But I want to make one other point Andrew, which is to me the problem with a lot of these things is it gets, it's a crutch. You know, it sort of like we talked about with like, hey, just fix my T-man and everything's going to be fine and it's like, no, that's just the beginning. You know, what I worry about when I see people who are clamoring for this stuff is a lot of times they don't realize that whether it's psychologically or otherwise, they sort of say, well, now that I've had this thing done, I don't have to do the hard work of the real rehab. I mean, if I've learned anything through my shoulder surgery and I'm now three and a half months out, how's it feel? Amazing. I mean, look, I still can't do a lot of stuff. It's going to be, you know, a while. I haven't even been able to shoot a bow yet and it'll probably be a year before I'll go back to, you know, long dead hangs and heavy dead lifts. I mean, I don't maybe nine months, but it's, you know, I'm not there yet. But what I learned through a really amazing pre-hab and rehab process is like you just gotta do the work and it's freaking hard. Shoulders are the most tedious boring thing in the world. I mean, three days a week, I am doing four days a week. I am doing one hour of just dedicated stuff for this shoulder that is super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But I mean, I have faith in the methodology, right? And I think a lot of people are saying, just shoot the stem cells into me and I don't have to do any of that stuff. And the reality is, I think that's a very dangerous place to be. You ever tried BPC-1-5-7? Yeah, we tried it. We had, you know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, we had a bunch of patients ask about it. So, you know, my view is, okay, I was pretty convinced that there was no safety downside to it. So I was like, well, I wouldn't prescribe it to a patient unless I tried it myself. So me and another doc in the practice Ralph, we did it for, I don't know, a couple of months. I didn't notice a single thing. Interesting. Well, thank you for that. Shifting to a less esoteric, but and I think probably more important topic overall, metabolomics. I'm talking about this before we set down to record. What is what are metabolomics? Why should we be thinking about them? I have some idea of what it might be about, but most people I think are not thinking about metabolomics at all. And for those that are, I'm sure they could learn more. So tell us about metabolomics and what you'd like to see more of in the world of metabolomics. Yeah, so omics is just the term that we used to describe the study of of something. So genomics, right, is like the broad study of genes and, you know, proteomics, the broad study of proteins and things like that. So metabolomics is just the study of metabolites. And metabolites unlike a lot of these other things, there are relatively finite number of these things, many of which are known, but some of which are not known. So glucose is a metabolite. The CdlCoA is a metabolite lactate is a metabolite. And so the question is, what do we know about these things and how they work? And more importantly, what do we know about certain physiologic states and the metabolomic profile that results from them? So let's use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands the data are unambiguously clear, exercise produces about the most favorable phenotype imaginable. So if you wanted to take a genomics approach to understanding that you might look at is there a change in the genome when you exercise? And the answer is probably not, but maybe if you looked at the, you know, methylation patterns and epigenome, you could look at epigenomics studies. But you might instead look at kind of the proteomics side of that, like what is gene expression doing? And there you would see a lot of changes. Well, what I don't think people are really understanding, although there was a very interesting paper that just came out two weeks ago, that looks for novel metabolites that are changing. As there are huge signal in a metabolomic profile that looks different in the state of exercise versus non-exercise and could that represent part of how exercise is transmitting its benefit through the body? You know, people always talk about the holy grail of metabolomics would be, can you find pill to mimic exercise? And I think the answer to that question is going to be undoubtedly no. For a couple of reasons, one, even if you could mimic the longevity sort of lifespan, parts of it, you could never mimic the health span parts of it. But what if you could do both? Right? What if there were small molecules that can replicate some of the protective benefits of exercise and you could combine those with exercise? What if those could be treatments for other disease states like diabetes? Things like that? So that's why I think this field of metabolomics is relatively untapped. And I think, you know, potentially the next sort of frontier. Speaking of frontiers, I hear a lot nowadays about GLP1 and pharmacology that prescription drugs that mimic or increase GLP1 directly, who could on like peptide. People are talking about this as the blockbuster obesity drug. I haven't heard this much talk about a drug to adjust human body weight favorably since the discussions of fenfen when I was in college and then of course fenfen was pulled from the market because people were dying, not left and right, but enough people died that they pulled it from the market. Which, by the way, is an interesting story. You know, it was the anantomer that they chose to use that was the wrong anantomer and what it resulted in was God, I think it was like some mitral valve. Yeah, it was an MVP. Yeah, it was something in the mitral valve. Yeah, I think the court attendant, a were rupturing and the mitral valve. And it was mostly young women I think were getting, you know, horrible pulmonary diseases a result of it. Probably pulmonary hypertension or something like that. But there were, you know, two anantomers of the drug and had they just use the other one. This issue wouldn't have happened. And there was a stupid reason why they made the choice to use the one they did. And it's where those things were once you make the mistake, you're never going back. It's not like that company could say, okay, we want to do over, but we're going to do it with the right version. So it's a tragic outcome. But but you're absolutely right. I think the GLP1 agonists are have more efficacy. And, you know, for all intensity and for everything we can see certainly seem safer. Are you excited about them? Yeah, I mean, I think we're just seeing the kind of tip of the iceberg. They're not miracle drugs, right? They come with problems, right? Which is, you know, they're, they're, they're catabolic across the board. So patients are losing fat, but they're losing muscle as well. So, you know, just sent all the Jim Jockey's running from some agutin all. That's all you have to say. All you have to say now is about something is that it's going to drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's skin hair or nails. And it's like people, it could extend life to being 250 years old and people are gone. Humans are human. That's a neuroscience and psychology issue, not a biology medicine issue. But I'm pleased to hear that you're excited by them, because I hear a lot of excitement. Yeah. I haven't heard anything disastrous about them. It takes a while to get people up to dose. So if you're looking at semi-glutide, the dose that was studied. So they did a one-year trial or maybe it was a little over that maybe 60 weeks. But it took about 16 weeks to get the patients comfortably up to 2.4 milligrams weekly, which was the dose that they ultimately stayed on. In our experience, when we use it, we don't even usually go up to 2.4 milligrams. We can usually get enough benefit between one and two milligrams. And we usually move people along a little bit quicker. But we've definitely had our sheriff patients who can't tolerate it due to the nausea. Interesting. Which might be part of how it's working, right? It's sort of suppression of appetite, which if taken to an extreme can produce nausea. Interesting. Yeah, I think most of the effective of semi-glutide is central, not peripheral. So I don't know. I saw one paper that GLP1 is acting both on cells in the periphery to cause gut distension. In some ways, there sort of make people feel full through promotion of literally mechanical receptors that make people feel as if their stomach is distended, even though they're stomach is empty. And then perhaps some central hyperphalanmic effects. Is that? Yeah, I think it's doing, I would bet 80% of its hyperphalamus. It is also improving insulin sensitivity in the periphery. But I don't think that that's accounting for much of its benefit. Super interesting. And there's next gen versions of these that seem to be more long lasting. So right now, if you look at coming off semi-glutide, you're going to see a weight regain. So there's newer versions that seem to preserve the weight loss even off the drug. So it begs the ultimate question, which is like, what's the total use case for this going to be? Is this going to be a drug you cycle on and off? Or is it going to be a drug that a person has to stay on indefinitely? And if so, will they become tacky-flactic? Will they gain a resistance to it? So it's still super early days on these things. My hope is that it would be a little bit like the way that you described testosterone and estrogen therapies that would allow people to do more of the behavioral work that's absolutely required for health spend in my spend. Yep. And we've also seen on the flip side of that, you can cheat through semi-glutide, right? People who, you know, you can drink a lot of calories and sort of get around the drug. So, you know, for example, like, you know, we always encourage patients who want to lose weight to really just eliminate alcohol. Like that's like that's the cheapest, easiest trick to lose weight. And so if you're still drinking a lot of alcohol, which is incredibly caloric and just drinking a lot of caloric stuff, we've seen that that's less, this is just anecdotal in our patients, but we've seen that that's it's easier to get around the benefits of the drug that way. I so appreciate your answers today. First of all, they were incredibly thorough and pointed towards real-world application. I also just want to thank you more broadly for the work that you do, because obviously you have this incredible clinical experience and patient population that you work very closely with. But I see you really as one of the few, both clinicians and I realize you're an MD, did you do a PhD as well? No, but I consider you a scientist clinician, clinician scientist, is the appropriate wording of that, of course, in the way that you really still drill into studies in detail. I know a lot of clinicians, not all of them do that for sure. And the fact that you're so hungry for the new incoming knowledge as well as the old literature. So it's an incredibly rich data set in that brain of yours and I really appreciate you sharing it with us both in your podcast, in the upcoming book, which I think we'll certainly have you on here again in anticipation of that, but I know I and a ton of other people are really excited for the book and in the way that you approach social media and podcasts and going on podcasts. Thank you so much. I learned a ton. I know everyone learned a ton. Thanks, Andrew. Great to be here, Matt. Thank you. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Dr. Peter Atia, all about the things that we can do in order to maximize our lifespan and health span.

And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science."
vid00010," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast where we discuss science, science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today my guest is Jeff Cavaliere. Jeff Cavaliere holds a master of science in physical therapy and is a certified strength and conditioning specialist. He did his training at the University of Connecticut stores, one of the top five programs in the world in physical therapy and sports medicine. I discovered Jeff Cavaliere over 10 years ago from his online content. His online content includes information about how to train for strength, how to train for hypertrophy, which is muscle growth, how to train for endurance, as well as how to rehabilitate injuries to avoid muscular imbalances, nutrition and supplementation. I've always found his content to be incredibly science-based, incredibly clear, sometimes surprising and always incredibly actionable. It is therefore not surprising that he has one of the largest online platforms for fitness nutrition supplementation and injury rehabilitation. Jeff has also worked with an enormous number of professional athletes and has served as head physical therapist and assistant strength coach for the New York Metz. Again, the content that Jeff Cavaliere has posted online has been so immensely useful to me over the years that I was absolutely thrilled to get the chance to sit down with him and ask him about everything from how to train in terms of how to train. I've had a lot of great training and endurance training and how to stretch. Indeed, we talked about nutrition, we talked about supplementation, we talked about how to really avoid creating imbalances in muscle and in neural control over muscle. It's a wonderful thing that's really wonderful about Jeff, he really has an understanding of not just how muscles and bones and tendons and ligaments work together, but how the nervous system interfaces with those. We talked about the mental side of training, including when to bring specific concentration to the muscles that you're training and when to think more about how to move weights through space and think more about the movements overall. I'm certain that you'll find the conversation that we held to be immensely useful and informative for your fitness practices and also for how you mentally approach fitness in general and how to set up a lifelong fitness practice. One that will give you the strength that you desire, one that will give you the aesthetic results that you desire, one that will set you up for endurance and cardiovascular health, basically an overall fitness program. I really feel this is where Jeff Cavaliere shines above and beyond so many of the other PT's and fitness so-called influencers that are out there. Again, everything is grounded in science, everything is clear and everything is actionable. And while we do cover an enormous amount of information during today's episode, if you want to dive even deeper into that information, you can go to atkleenex.com where you'll find some of Jeff's programs. You can also find him at Atkleenex on YouTube. There you will find videos, for instance, like how to repair or heal from lower back pain. Something that I actually followed directly long before I ever met Jeff has over 32 million views and that is not by accident is because the protocols there again are surprising and actionable. They relieved my back pain very quickly without surgery. So I'm immensely grateful for that content and it extends into everything from again, high-purchasing for endurance and straight training and so on. Again, it's atkleenex.com as the website atkleenex on YouTube and also atkleenex on Instagram. The UberMinLab podcast is proud to announce that we've partnered with Momentus Supplements. We've done that for several reasons. First of all, the quality of their supplements is exceedingly high. Second of all, we wanted to have a location where you could find all of the supplements discussed on the UberMinLab podcast in one easy to find place. You can now find that place at livemomentus.com slash huberman. In addition, Momentus Supplements ship internationally, something that a lot of other supplement companies simply do not do. So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US or you live abroad. Right now, not all of the supplements that we discussed on the UberMinLab podcast are listed, but that catalog of supplements is being expanded very rapidly. And a good number of them that we've talked about, some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus and other aspects of mental and physical health are already there. Again, you can find them at livemomentus.com slash huberman. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1. I started taking AG1 way back in 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason that I started taking AG1 and the reason I still take AG1 twice a day is that it covers all of my foundational health needs for mental health, physical health, and performance. As I mentioned earlier, it has vitamins and minerals that cover any deficiencies I might have in my diet. It also has probiotics and the probiotics are key for supporting the so-called gut microbiome. The gut microbiome are trillions of little microbi bacteria that live in our gut from our throat all the way down to the base of our gut. That support everything from our immune system to our hormone health to the so-called gut brain access. That is, our gut and our brain are in direct communication with one another in ways that support our mood, our ability to think and overall brain health. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash fubremen to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Vitamin D3 and K2 are essential for an enormous number of aspects of your mental health, physical health, and performance by impacting things like hormone regulation, calcium regulation, and cardiovascular health. Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash fubremen to claim that special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 sleep. 8 sleep makes smart mattress covers with heating and sleep tracking and importantly cooling capacity. I've talked many times before on this podcast and on another podcast about the close relationship between temperature and sleep. That is, your body temperature has to drop by about one to three degrees in order to fall asleep and waking up involves heating up of your body by about one to three degrees. Now, some people run cold during the night. They need to heat their sleeping environment. Other people run too hot during the night. I'm one such person. I tend to wake up in the middle of the night if I get warm at all. I'm able to cool my sleeping environment in a very precise way, even so precise that I can control the temperature at the beginning, middle, and end of the night, so that I fall asleep easily, stay deeply asleep, and wake up feeling better than I've ever felt before. The pod pro cover by 8 sleep is their most advanced solution on the market for thermal regulation. It pairs dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking if you want to use that. Also, it's a nice feature that it will vibrate in the morning and wake you up. I'd rather like that vibration feature too. You can add the cover to any mattress and start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. So again, it can be customized to your sleep needs. If you want to try 8 sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com slash hubrimon and check out the pro pod cover and save $150 at checkout. They currently ship within the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Again, that's 8 sleep.com slash hubrimon to save $150 at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka. Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two all-american swimmers from Stanford, and everything about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses is made with performance in mind. That said, the aesthetics of Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses is superb. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order to be able to see clearly. Roka understands this and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses in a manner such that when you move from say a shady area to a brightly lit area or when you are in different lit environments indoors, you can always see with crystal clarity. And they won't slip off if you sweat. In fact, they were originally designed for exercise. You can wear them well running or cycling, but they have a terrific aesthetics. So unlike a lot of the so-called performance or exercise glasses that are out there that make people frankly look like cyborgs in my opinion. Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses look terrific. You'd be proud to wear them to work, or out to dinner, or when you exercise. If you want to try Roka glasses, you can go to roca.com. That's ROK.com and enter the code, Huberman, to save 20% off on your first order. Again, that's rocaROKa.com and enter the code Huberman at checkout. And now, from my discussion with Jeff Cavalier. Jeff, such a pleasure for me to have you here. I'm glad to be here. It's amazing. I have a long time consumer of your content. I've learned a tremendous amount about fitness. Both in the weight room, cardio, nutrition, things that I've applied for over a decade. So for me, this is particularly meaningful. And my goal here is really to ask a bunch of questions to which I'm interested in the answers, but also for which I know the audience is really curious about. So one of your mantras is, if you want to look like an athlete, train like an athlete. And I think that's something really special that sets aside what you do from a lot of other very well qualified people do. And in terms of the use of weights and resistance, whether or not it's body weight, or weights in the gym, or pulleys versus cardio, you know, in terms of overall health aesthetics and athleticism, is there a way that you could point to, you know, the idea that maybe people should be doing, you know, 50% resistance training of 50% cardio, maybe it's 70, 30, maybe it's 30, 70. And here I'm talking about the typical person who would like to maintain or maybe even add some muscle mass, probably in particular areas for most people, as opposed to just overall mass. Although we'll talk about that later, and people want to maintain a relatively low body fat percentage, and being good cardiovascular health. What's the sort of contour of a basic program that anybody could think about as a starting place? I think it's like a 60, 40 split, which would be leaning towards weight training, you know, strength and, and, and then, you know, the conditioning aspect be about 40%. So if you look at it over a course of a training week, I mean, five days in a gym would be a great task. Obviously not in the gym, it could be done at home, but three days training, one day when I was a Friday, conditioning Tuesday, there was a, you know, two days. It's a pretty easy roundabout way to split that up. Of course, depending upon training goals, and as you said, the aesthetic goals like that will shift dramatically, but if you want to see the benefits of both, that's probably the effective dose for strength training and the effective dose for conditioning at the bare minimum level. And then being a much better performer, in conditioning wise, you're going to want to do more than that. And in terms of the duration of those workouts, what's your suggestion? I've been weight training for about 30 years running for about 30 years, and mainly for health, and have found that if I work hard in the gym or at resistance training for more than 60 minutes or so, it's very hard for me to recover, start getting colds, I start getting weaker from workout to workout. But amazingly, at least to me, if I keep those workouts to about 10 minutes of warm up and 50, 5, 0 minutes or so of really hard work for resistance training, and I keep the cardiovascular work to about 30 to 45 minutes. I feel great, and I seem to make some progress, at least some place in the workout from workout to workout. I mean, it's those are good numbers, because those are kind of numbers that we usually preach. We try to keep our workouts to an hour or less. If possible, now depending upon the split that you're following, if you're on a total body split, there's just going to be more that has to be done in a given amount of time. Again, if you're training primarily for strength, that could prolong the workout, because the longer rest time is in between sets. But in general, when you're not focused on that one aspect, but the overall health picture, then you can get the job done in under an hour. And again, I always say on top of if you want to look like an athlete training, like an athlete is you can either train longer, you can train hard, but you can't do both. And I really believe that the focus for me, I have a busy life, I have a lot of other things that I do believe it or not, and it's like, I want to go hard and I want to go get out. And I find that my body also responds to that, I think a lot of guys about it respond to that, and particularly, as you start to get older, I think it's the length of the workout that actually causes more problems than the intensity of what you're doing. And particularly if you're warmed up properly, like you said, I've found personally that my warm-up has had to become more of an integral part of my workout than it ever has before. I never, I could get in the gym when I was 20, and I'm going right over, I'm doing the one set, two sets, I'm ready to go. And I never do another workout warm-up set for any of the other exercises I do the rest of the day. That's not sure anymore. And I found that as long as I'm willing to sort of give myself a little bit of a warm-up, the intensity's not what bothers me. You know, I'm very much in control of the weights that I use and it doesn't bother me, but if I start to go pretty long, I start to feel achy, or I start to have problems. So again, depending upon age, that also plays a factor in the length. But again, I think everybody can achieve an standard program, can achieve the results that they want within an hour. In terms of splits, you mentioned splits. And so for those who aren't familiar with this term splits, it's really which body parts are you training on which days. Seems like almost everybody follows a weekly workout schedule, the body of course doesn't care about the week. There's no reason that once every seven days or twice every seven days makes sense physiologically, it's just the bite doesn't work that. But that's the way life is structured. I've seen you discuss three days a week, whole body workouts. I've heard of splits like a pushing one day, pulling another day, legs another day, a day off repeat. I mean, there's so many variations in this. What are some general themes that we can throw out there? And in order to avoid the huge matrix of possibilities, you have some wonderful content that points out. And we will cap in our caption show notes, we will link out to some of those that are different ways to design splits. But in terms of giving people a logic of how to think about splitting up body parts, what's governing the split? What are the rules and the logic that dictate a split? For me, the first rule is, will you stick to it? Right? Like if you, because there are split, I don't particularly like full body splits. I was actually talking to Jesse about that the other day. I don't necessarily like to have to train everything. Of course, the volumes will come down per muscle group. But if you don't like to do that, and you actually don't look forward to your workout because you're dreading having to do everything. And feeling maybe too fatigued by the time you're workout's over, or the fact that those generally do take a little bit longer and don't fit into your schedule, I don't care how effective the split is. A split not done is not effective. So you need to find one that fit. So maybe you go into an alternative option like a push pull leg is like you mentioned. That could be done either one cycle through the week. And I'm one day one day Friday split, or it could be twice in a week, so you're actually training six times where you repeat it. You know, pull push legs, pull push legs, or, you know, however you want to do it with either a day off and between the three days or at the end of the six days. And again, that actually impacts your schedule. I've broken that down before, whereas if you put it in between the three days, it's good because you're giving yourself an extra rest day in between. But it starts to shift that day off every week as we wrap around. So for those guys that were choosing that seven days schedule, a lot of convenience in our heads, you know, it starts to mess with that off day. So others like to just keep it predictably, let's sound a Sunday and train six days in a row. But that's a better way to maybe group similar muscle actions together, which I think I definitely prefer that because if I'm going to be training, you know, pulling movements, at least there's a synergy between them. And I feel like I'm looking to achieve one goal that day. And then, I mean, quite honestly, you can go back to the bro split days. And those still work effectively. There's a reason why they work in the past. I think that science shows that there's smarter ways to do them these days. Like you can, you can come back and hit a related muscle. So you could do, let's say, five steps on one day and then come back two days later and do back, realizing again synergy between the exercises there. Your biceps are going to be restimulated again. So you could figure out ways to make that work. But the thing that I think is is effective there is that tends to be one of the ones that people like the most because they can go in, they get their pump, they feel good. It's pretty solely focused on one muscle group. Is that the definition of a bro split one one? One super group that I see. So it's very much geared towards strength and aesthetics, really maximizing. Yeah. Chest body. Probably more more aesthetics than strength. Yeah. Yeah. You're just going to be the bro. Yeah. But again, like, you know, in here, I am a science guy and I can appreciate the benefits of a bro split, especially because again, like, to what end? Who's who's goal are we are trying to achieve here? There is or are you know, like, I mean, if I'm applying my standards and my goals or even like athletic ideals, but they just want to get in shape, then it's perfectly fine to do a, to do a bro split. And that instance, if you're sticking to it again and you're seeing the results that you want to see from it. But they're able to, you know, really keep their focus on one muscle that get to focus on, you know, like it looks a lot of times people struggle with the way of an exercise feels until their second or third set. Like, they don't have that purpose set of ability to kind of lock in an exercise. So spending a few not only sets them the same, you know, exercise, but then doing another exercise with the same muscle group helps them to dial in a little bit better and get more out of their training. Yeah. And I think it's interesting. I think important question early on when I started resistance training, which was when I was 16 high school. I got in touch with and I was learning from Mike Spencer. So I'm so interested in that. Yeah. And Mike was very helpful, very, very helpful. We got to be friendly. So I just read his book on it. Get a chance to ask myself jealous. Well, I back then, no internet, I, you know, I paid by Western Union type thing to send them some money for the back of the magazine. And then he got on the phone with me and my mother at the time was like, why is this grown man falling in the house? And he gave me a very straightforward split, which was shoulders arms one day. He had to be taking two days off and then training with legs and then two days off and then chest and back, etc. And that's a very, very, very, very, sort of, you know, breaking them down that way, chest and back or chest and bives, you know. Yeah. And he worked very well for me. I probably would have because of my age, I think. And because it was the, I was untrained. But largely untrained, I think it would have grown on many different programs, but it worked very well for me. I eventually just just made that in every other day things. So shoulders arms day off legs day or two off because it makes legs right, at least for me. I'm not training the next day. And then I'm not doing much of anything athletic the next day and chest and back in a repeat and so on. And the reason I found that helpful is I almost always recovered between workouts. The, the six day a week program of push pull legs, push pull legs to me seems excruciating from two standpoints. One is at least with my recovery abilities or lack of recovery abilities. I can't imagine coming back feeling fresh. And the other one is if I, if I'm in the gym more than four days a week, I really start to fatigue about the whole psychological experience of it. Whereas if I'm in there three or four days a week, in other words, if I put a day off in between each workout, I really want to be there and I get in there with with a lot of fire. And I'm also doing other things on the off days. So I think that I love that you mentioned the split that you'll stick to and that you can bring the intensity to because I think that that's really important. I sometimes hear about two a day training. I've done two a day training twice in my lifetime, both times I got sick two days later. Yeah. That's correlation, not causation. Yeah. You know, but. Is there ever an instance where two a day weight training makes sense for the non drug assisted typical recovery ability person? I actually, I think it makes sense in some scenarios, but it doesn't make sense practically for a lot of people's schedules. So like if you could break down, let's say you were going to do even a, you know, a, a, a, some version of a total body session, or maybe like you're going to do an upper lower split, right? You can do an upper workout and do the anterior chain or the pushing portion of that in one session and then come back and do the pulling session later on at night if you had the opportunity to. The thing that you've benefited from there is the freshness of focus. Again, like something in my head sack is sacrificed by the time you get towards the latter half of whatever workout you're in. To the same point, you may be for like when you start to approach that 50 minutes an hour, you know, mark you are either losing focus, you're losing energy, you're losing contract availability, you're losing something. And if you're relegating whatever it is, the pulling portion of that to the end of that workout something suffer so that okay, and that if you realize that's happening, then maybe you switch them up the next time you do the workout where the pulling portion of the upper workout goes first. And then the pushing goes later so you're at least not just continuing that cycle, but at the same time if you were able to kind of split them up, you get a chance to kind of take a break, you can have that freshness of focus again, and you could actually get a better effort in because again, I think effort drives the results. So if the effort is not compromised then you should be able to do that, but systemically is that problem. And I think that it is a problem for a lot of people, it's just hard to, it's hard to read the engine up a lot of times the end of the day, you know, you warm that thing up once, it's like that car in the winter, you get it going once you're lucky, okay, now you gotta drive it the rest of the day, but you know, you put it in the garage and try to start the next day, it's a problem. So, you know, young people can get away with a lot more than older people could, you know, I've never had a strong recovery quotient, but if I stick to this one day off in between. Every once in a while, two days in a row, training maybe because I have to travel and I want to make sure I get all the workouts and kind of thing. I seem to be okay. I like your example of warming up the car, spoken like a true East Coast, East Coast, or those of us from the West Coast. Yeah, took a moment there, but, you know, I, we, we focused on the East Coast and the Midwest get it and certainly from from Europe. In terms of the mixing up of cardiovascular training and resistance training, same day, different day, which one should come first, which one should come second. If one main goals, again, everyone listening has different goals are most people would like to either maintain or gain some muscle. I don't know many people that want to lose muscle. I mean, Tainer gained some muscle usually in specific locations on their body. Most people would like to be a bit leaner or a lot leaner. There are a few people out there that are either naturally lean or don't want or actually just want to gain weight. But assuming that people want to get leaner, put on some muscle, maintain muscle, and want to have a healthy heart and a healthy brain, which basically requires a healthy cardiovascular system. How would you incorporate cardiovascular work into the overall weekly regimen? So again, I think that the, you know, the bare minimum was probably twice a week in terms of cardiovascular. If you want to have some semblance of cardiovascular condition, but I think most people who actually need it more or want to pursue it more than that are going to need more time to do that. So at some point, it can't just be relegated to a day off or a day off from the, from the weight training workouts. So at some point it has to occur on the same day, you know, and in that case, I just like to put it. That is, you're not your primary goal, but you're looking more for the just the overall picture, you know, the aesthetics you mentioned putting muscle on in certain areas. Then I would put it at the end of the workout because you don't want any weight compromise. The weight training workout. And as we've sort of referenced a couple of times already the intensity of those workouts is important. And we know there's a strength component to those workouts. Also that is going to, you know, have the helpful stimulus for growth. So the conditioning, the cardio, that stuff done prior to any training, you know, straight training workout is likely going into an inferior ability to perform at your best. So unless it's just done for a quick little warm up in the beginning, but then it's not sustained long enough really to be a benefit for cardiovascular condition. So I just like to, you know, put that at the end realizing that even if my effort level is lower, my output is lower. If it's still placing a demand on my cardiac output to get that conditioning effect because I'm fatigued, it still hasn't demand on my cardiac output. So it's still achieving its goal, but it didn't interfere with my main goal of being able to increase my performance in the gym. Got it. And in terms of the form of cardiovascular training, I've seen you do a number of, I have to say, very impressive high intensity interval type work. So, bird be type work or push ups with, you know, with crunches mixed into them. Anyway, people can see your videos to, I didn't describe those in the best way, but rather than on the treadmill or out jogging for 30, 45 minutes. Is that because you prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training or is it because you live in called Connecticut. And you don't want to be out jogging on the roads in the middle of the winter. I think all the above, I mean, those are factors from a personal level, but I think that if you are. If we could blend. Function across these realms and not have such a delineation between, this is my way of training and this is my conditioning, but figure out a way to blend them together. I always think that you've got a better opportunity to get that more well-rounded result. And I like to kind of mix up that straight conditioning work and also some of the footwork, you know, drills. We have, we have some high expectations for guys that come into our programs, like to just do some footwork drills, like ladders or lion drills or something. And you know what happens, people become intrigued and interested. Like, I never, I haven't tried this in a high school, you know, and maybe come interested in just the challenge of it. And then as we become almost distracted by the challenge, we're now like finding ourselves conditioning. And I always think that's an important part that sometimes you've got to draw people in to show them what they might be interested in. And from the output or the effect of it, I just think that when you're able to blend some of some, you know, still maintain some of that strength training into the exercise. So as you mentioned, let's say I'm doing some kind of a push-up or a burp, I mean, there is, there is an anorobic component to that that is going to be helpful. That rather than just walking or just jogging. Not just not to say that that isn't an effective means for strict cardiac conditioning. It's one of the ways that we've had for, you know, centuries, you know, to do it. But I just think that if we can blend it, then it becomes maybe a little bit more interesting. And you get some of those crossover benefits and it doesn't become so segmented in terms of what we're trying to do. I love the idea of bringing some mental challenge and some desire to improve a skill while we're doing it. And it's not something that I thought I'd be for and it simply because I've overlooked it, but it makes sense because my sister who's reasonably fit, although I'm always trying to get her to do a bit more. She always asks me, you know, what should I take? And I'm a, I don't believe her in supplements, some for certain people in certain instances, but I keep telling her, you know, it's the behaviors are going to end. Nutrition are going to have the greatest outsized positive effect. And she loves things like dance classes and things or kickboxing these kinds of things which, so it makes sense that if you can hook somebody on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect and kind of trick them into doing more cardio. Right. So to speak, that's terrific. Also, the neuroscience is in me just has to say, forgive me, that any time you're engaging that, you know, that two sets of motor neurons, ones in your brain, the upper motor neurons and the ones in your spinal cord, any time you're engaging those upper motor neurons, which are for deliberate, well controlled action, you're doing a great thing for your brain in terms of brain longevity. So I'm now I need to incorporate some actual skills in the brain training. Going back to weight training a bit, one of the most important things I learned from you over the years was that when training to increase muscle size, to really think not so much about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles. Yeah. I also heard this from my friend Ben Pockolski, who's a very well accomplished, he was a bodybuilder now. He's into other aspects of fitness, teachers fitness, but don't move weights, challenge muscles unless you're trying to power lift or something that's sort of which I'm not immensely helpful. But the other thing that I learned from you that a combined with that was this idea that certain muscles will grow better and get stronger much more easily. Maybe even will recover better because of our ability to contract them really hard. And this, what I call the Cavalier test, which is, at least if I could paraphrase the so-for instance, if I can, it's always the bicep isn't it? Let's use the calf or the bicep. If you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit, it almost feels like a cramp or a cramp or you can flex your calf to the point where it really cramps up a little bit. And then you're nodding up. That's a pretty good indication that you're going to be able to stimulate that muscle well under load if you're doing the movement properly. And that's the feeling to actually aim for each repetition, maybe even throughout the repetition. For me, this completely transformed my results. And this was, I think maybe five, six years ago that I first heard this from you, body parts that for me lagged behind that I thought maybe genetically weren't going to work for me. Immediately just started growing, right? And I was getting stronger and stronger. And I thought this is really something so much so that I've dedicated a portion of my research along with in collaboration with another group to try and understand what's happening in these upper motor neurons in the brain that can engage the muscles even more. And that it's not just about progressive overload or putting a pump into the muscle that it's really this mind muscle connection is a real thing when it comes to predicting results. And that you can get better at it. So, for giving me, for paraphrasing your incredible content around this, it made a tremendous difference for me and a number of other people that have passed that along to. But what can you, first of all, how did you arrive at that? Because we hear about the mind muscle connection, but I really heard it first from you. How did you arrive at this kind of cramp test, the Cavalier test, as I'll call it? It's always weird when people name things after themselves and science, but other scientists can name things. So there is now officially the Cavalier test is whether or not you can cramp the muscle in the absence of load just flexing it. So the point where it hurts a little bit, that would be an in a good indication that you could grow that muscle well. So how did you come up with this? I mean, it just, honestly, it's something that made sense to me because during my workouts, even as a young kid just starting out, I always wanted to know what is it working. A lot of people ask that question more something you'd think. What is this supposed to work? And a lot, I don't know if you've ever noticed, but when people ask that question, if they're being trained by a trainer, and the trainer is saying, well, just do this, do this exercise and they'll show you how to do it. But then they'll say, but what is it supposed to work? Where am I supposed to feel this? People did it just inherently ask that question a lot of people will. I was one of those that did that, and I asked that question, now because I knew what I was doing, but just because I don't know, I wanted to know what was supposed to be doing the work. Once you do that and you start to seek that out and say, okay, well, the bicep is what's supposed to be doing the work, then I want to make sure the biceps do in the work, right? So then I would just sort of really tweak the movement to make it do more work or feel more uncomfortable. Or get a stronger contraction knowing if that's supposed to do the job. It wasn't until PT school learning, oh, well, you know, flexion of the elbow is the brachialis and the biceps responsible for supination. You start to learn other components of it, but all I wanted to know was to bring my arm up in a curl, what is supposed to do the job. So I would seek out ways to make that happen better. And when I was able to do that, I could feel the stronger contraction. And I just, I don't know what it was. I was no visionary. I just felt like I knew that that was going to be better for me. If the muscle I was trying to grow was being stressed more effectively. So when I was attempting to do this across different exercises, I would notice that what I could do potentially on a curl where my arm is up, you know, where you ask me to flex my biceps that position, I couldn't do if I was, you know, doing a concentration curl or I couldn't carry over to a cable curl. And that shouldn't really change, right? Because the function is still largely the same. There's still elbow flexion, there's still supination, like why am I not able to do it there? And that's when it sort of occlude into me that like, you're my muscle connection on not just your mind with one muscle, but on every exercise matters. And it varies from exercise to exercise. And even if you don't gain muscle size from doing that, although I think it's very hard not to, especially for you not used to doing that, there's a term I like to call muscularity, you know, which is a difference, right? It's the level of sort of resting tone in the muscle. That improves dramatically. You know, if you can learn how to just start to engage that muscle better, the muscularity, the resting tone of that muscle is harder, it's more, it's more at attention, it's just more, it's more alive. You know, and that's all driven from being able to connect better neurologically with the muscle that you're trying to train. I've talked about a lot. In efficiency is really what you're trying to seek in movements when you're trying to create hypertrophy. When going when strength is your goal, efficiency of the movement is what you're looking for. You're looking to have muscles tied together and work well efficiently, the chest, the shoulders, the triceps to get a bar off of your chest during the bench press. You're not looking to make it a very inefficient, you know, leverages for your chest to try to grow your chest and a bench press. You're trying to let the whole package come together for a greater output. But when you're trying to go and create muscle hypertrophy or even this muscularity that I talk about, you need to seek ways to make it feel more uncomfortable, right? If you don't feel the discomfort that you're doing something wrong, and I struggle to this day on certain muscle groups to still do that, even knowing what I'm trying to work and knowing what the goal of everything I'm preaching here. It's very difficult for some muscles and for certain people to do this on certain muscles. But as you mentioned, practice does help, and the more you become consistent and deliberate with what you're trying to do, the more of a result you actually get. It's a couple of really poor boyads I'd like to delve into further. First of all, my hunch was always that the muscle groups that grew easily, most easily, and that I could contract hardest without any. The first time I did the Cavalier test got 10 out of 10, we give it a 10 out of 10 scale, you know, it could just like cinch isolate those muscles, cinch them grow them easily. I mean, there's certain why parts I want to say which ones because it doesn't really matter. That I always felt like if I just did pushups that I would grow and these muscles are far away from any of the muscles that are supposed to be involved in pushups, even though I like to think I'm doing pushups correctly. You'll tell me if I'm not. But some of that I think is genetic and some of that has to do with the sports that I played when I was younger. So I swam I played soccer, I escaped word, and then later I boxed, and so the muscles involved in those sports were always very easy to engage later when I went into the gym. So I guess it perhaps a call to parents, you know, having kids do a lot of dynamic activity seems like it might be a good idea. The other thing is this issue of muscularity, I have so glad you brought that up. There are and I have to imagine a large number of listeners who don't want to get bigger. They don't want to take up a larger clothing size. They don't want to take up more space. In fact, some of them would like to take up less space, but they want that quality that you're describing, which is that, you know, oftentimes you hear it more than the, here I'm stereotyping a bit, but with kindness, you know, you hear a, for women who are having weight training, they say, I don't want to get big often. Sometimes they do, but most women that I've helped weight train were talked about weight train say, I don't want to get better. I want to get tone, right? And I think what they're referring to is this quality of muscularity. 100%. This idea that at resting or at close to rest or any times when reaches out and grabs a glass that the muscles almost look like they're kind of twitching underneath the skin. And yet it's not serenrapskin anatomy chart types skin. So this thing of muscularity or resting tone, you know, has a physiological basis. I think it's how readily the nerves are communicating with the muscles. And you're saying that by learning to engage the muscles more actively, the resting tone or muscularity can improve. Have you seen that both in men and women? Yeah. And do you think this is something that takes upkeep maintenance or that you know, once you develop that and also you can just kind of let it coast. So I think like everything that keep your requires upkeep, you know, user-lose that I do believe firmly, but like I think that it's the development of the connections can be harder than the maintenance of the connection. As I said, I still struggle to this day for myself with, you know, unnamed muscle groups, you know, also, you know, but like, you know, there's just, there's just certain. Areas that are harder for your brain for whatever reason to just develop that connection at that type of level to create create that extra strong contraction. But I think that it with proper dedication and focus and I'll go right out and say, you know, calves is one of the areas that I don't necessarily have a great connection with. And I also obviously must not care so much because I don't put in the time and effort to create that connection as I could. So I think what might happen is, you know, yeah, there could be a struggle there, but then with with struggle comes to interest. Because you're like, well, I'll screw it on. I'm a, I'm a calf, not, I'm not going to do anything about it. You know, so I think if you put the, the required effort and the time and repetitions that you will develop that and once you do develop it, it's going to stick around a lot longer than it would had you not invested any time into it at all. You know, not requiring as much of that, but I mean, I, I don't know, like, you know, you mentioned now when you train it's like, you're, you're just part of how you train now like you're going hard, you're trying to, you know, really forcefully contract. You're not just moving the way I say from point A to point B, but you're like trying to contract the way through that range. That is a mindset that I try to put into whatever they, I'm doing unless, of course, I'm focused on us strength exercise where I'm just trying to lift a greater amount and use all the muscles together. But when the goal is in efficiency for high-perchography, I am really trying to create that contraction and it's just part of my training. So I guess that, you know, the for consistency sake as long as I'm training is happening. You know, if I, if I get away from training, there's not happening at all, but you know, even there, I probably, another embarrassing admission probably will, you know, Will, mindfully do it throughout the day even when they'll wait in my hand, you know, and certain muscle groups whether my abs or my arm or my shoulders or something. I'm doing something just to sort of engage the muscles. And I do think that some of that sort of, an aim practice actually helps by the time you go back into the gym. You just kind of keep that, you keep that, that connection going. Well, it certainly obeys all the rules of neuroplasticity, you know, the, the fire together wire together mantra, which is the words of my colleague Carla Schatz. Hold true for all aspects of neurofunction, including nerve to muscle. So these flexing throughout the day or the, the deliberate isolation of contracting a muscle throughout the day is without question engaging neuroplasticity. And if you were to do fewer of those repetitions, you're going to get less engagement of the nerve to muscle connection. I can say this with with with a smile and and with confidence because one of the first things all neuroscience students learn is about the neuro muscular junction because it's a, it's a really simple example of where the more times the nerve fires and gets the muscle to contract the stronger that connection get receptors are brought there, et cetera, et cetera. There's a whole bunch of mechanisms for the topic of another podcast, but basically that practice throughout the day is it makes total sense and works. And there's no, there believe me, there's no science behind that in terms of, you know, the application of it. You do it when you catch yourself doing it, you know, time and time, you know, but it is definitely something that's easily done, when you could actually put them inside bigger hyper created skin. So I have to first login, back to face a new one, just in this, really handy thing, to start think this is a carried out here right now, so all the boundaries that these websites have, whatever that community we're pushing around here, so everyone does that outs and thinking, well, it's a really huge, but progressive level of Cookie jeddle and So to speak. Yeah, certainly obeys the laws of nerve to muscle physiology. One to just touch on a couple of things. If the goal is to challenge muscles and one is dividing their body into, let's say, you know, a three or four day a week split or so or maybe up to six, how do you know when a muscle is ready to be challenged again? I've heard, okay, every 48 hours is protein synthesis increases and then we'll get into this and then it drops off. But frankly, if I train my legs hard, I can get stronger from workout to workout or at least better in some way, workout to workout, workout to leg workout, training them once every five to eight days. If I train them more often, I get worse. So whatever that 48 hour to 72 hour thing is somehow my legs don't obey that, but, you know, or maybe something else is wrong with me, but I'm sure there are many things else wrong with me, but how do you assess recovery at the local level? Meaning at the level of the muscles, we'll talk about soreness and getting better, stronger and more repetitions, et cetera. And then the systemic level, the level of the nerve system. And I'd love for you to tell us about the tool that, again, I learned from you, which is actually using a physical scale because it turns out, this is that it will let you tell what the tool is, but that tool is also actively being used for assessing cognitive decline and cognitive maintenance and cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's and dementia. I'd make a total sense. Makes a total sense. I, all right. So regarding the first part of the question, like, you know, how do you, how would you kind of dictate when a muscle is recovered? So I do think that what you're experiencing is totally real. That different muscles recover at different rates. And I've always been so fascinated by this concept. I've talked about internally with my team, but like, I feel like what we really need the holy grail to training is going to be when we're able to crack the code on an individual basis when a muscle is recovered and that is going to dictate its training schedule. And the fact that you might have a bicep that could be trained, you know, via a pulling workout or regular bicep that I can't work out. Forget the split at the moment. You might have a bicep that's able to be trained that can be trained again the next day, you know, and then the next day and then maybe you need a day off after that. But like, you know, in that, that can vary from person to person for sure and it can vary from muscle to muscle in that person over the course of time. As you mentioned, because the systemic recovery is going to impact all those muscles anyway, but let's say you're systemically recovering every muscle itself is going to have a recovery. And I think what's fascinating is that when you talked about before, we like to train this week or we have a like the way our mind looks at training. Well, if that was the case with the bicep, that bicep is a slave to the rest of your training split. You know, it's like, well, why does it have to be also at the end of every safe day or, you know, or whatever, when it might be spawned better to something much more frequently. And your legs are also being thrown into that mix. There's a Mike Menser concept where he's like, you know, trained it, you know, one set and be done for 14 days. I mean, you know, there's there's such a variability between muscle groups and you're you're linking them all together. I think that coming back and using muscle soreness as a guideline for that is one of the only tools we have in terms of the local level, you know, we don't really have, you know, being able to measure, let's say, CPK levels inside of a muscle would be amazing, you know, at a local level to see how, how recovered that muscle is, but that becomes fairly invasive, at least to my knowledge, it becomes fairly invasive. So, what are our tools? I mean, I think that at the basic level, that's the one that most people can relate to and easily identify and then use that as a guideline. And if you're training when you're really sore, it's probably not a great idea. And it's probably good indication that that muscle is not recovered. But at least hearing what you and I are saying here might be a comfort to the person and say, yeah, it is possible that it's not recovered just because 48 hours is the recommendation. And just because research points to muscle protein synthesis needing a restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe you're not necessarily there yet. And for that muscle, you're not there yet. So it's all really interesting stuff, but as far as the the systemic, you know, recovery, I think there's a lot of ways people talk about resting heart rate measured in the morning, all different kinds of core temperature and things like that that might become altered in a state of non-recovery. But grip strength is very, very much tied to performance and recovery. And when I was at the meds, we used to actually take grip strength measurements as a baseline in spring training all the time. Now obviously, as a baseball player, you're gripping a bat, you're pitcher, you're gripping a ball. Like, you know, having good grip strength is important. So if we've noticed that we had a very weak grip, it's just a good focal point of a specialized training component for the summer. Every day with those guys. No, we would do it in spring training. We'd do sort of a baseline entry level measurement and then we would measure it throughout the season, maybe once every two weeks or three weeks. And the idea there was to manage a recovery, measure the recovery. I just gave it away, you know, to determine overall recovery, your grip strength is pretty highly correlated. So we have found that with one of those scales, those old fashioned bathroom scales that like, uh, bat bat them beyond or wherever you can get, which by the way, almost impossible. I believe just in our searching for the last scale to put in that video. And we almost couldn't find one because everything is like digital and, you know, like this, I'm looking at the old fashioned dial controls. It's like old Mac and Toshpock here. So there's a huge market for them in old phones. I had one. Keep your phones now in 30 years. The lean phone now, where the lot of the lot. So, you know, I wound up, you know, finding one and it's a great tool for just squeezing the, the, the, the scale with your hands and seeing what type of output you could get. Um, and I think we all can relate to this when you just visualize, imagine the last time you were sick or that we're, or just try this, you know, next time you wake up in the morning. When you first wake up in the morning, you're still groggy. Try to squeeze your hand. Try to make a fist as hard as you can. You're going to sit there and grade your fist because it won't contract as hard as you know it can. You don't have the ability to just create the output. And that is because in that state, you're still sleepy, you're still fatigued. You're, you're not even awake at, at the, you know, the, the whole level at this point. Well, that is, that is still an actual phenomenon that happens that, you know, a lack of recovery, or lack of weightfulness, or whatever you want to say is, is going to lead to a decreased output there. So when you start to measure that on a daily basis, you can get a pretty good sense of where you're at. And I think when people start to see a drop off of 10% or so or even greater of, of their, grip output, um, you really should skip the gym that day because I don't think there's much you're going to do there that's going to be that, that beneficial, even if it is the data train legs or whatever day it is. I, I love this tool. It's simple. It's low cost. If you can find such a scale, I guess you could also find one of those grippers that, um, and you can do this in a very non-conitative way, um, but better would be a scale where you could actually measure how hard you can squeeze this thing at a given time a day. Uh, it draws to mind just a little neuroscience factory in the world of circadian neurobiology. One of the consistent findings is that in the middle of your nighttime, the weight people up and they'll say do this test. Right. In the laboratory, they use a different apparatus, but essentially the same thing. And in the middle, the night grip strength is very, very low. Yeah. And you know, mid-morning grip strength is high and as the body temperature goes up into the afternoon, grip strength goes higher and higher and higher and then drops off. There's a circadian rhythm and grip temperature. So you probably want to do this at more or less the same time each day. If you're going to use it, but I think it's brilliant and, um, in its simplicity and its directness to these upper motor neurons because that's really what it's assessing your ability. Again, it's about the ability to contract the muscles hard if you can't do that. You're not going to get an effective word. Yeah. I mean, they're certainly more sophisticated tools to as a, as a PT that we have a hand grip dynamometers. And we can, we can measure one side at a time too. I'm not really, I'm getting a little bit blinded by the fact that both hands are squeezing into that scale and I don't get really a left-right comparison. But even at that level, that could give you a little bit more detail, but that comes into the cost as a pretty expensive devices. But if it's, listen, if you're an athlete, you know, the 200-300 bucks that cost to have one of those would be well worth, you know, the added investment. Well, and I'm sure some of our listeners who want one too because there are a lot of tech geeks out there, um, not tech industry geeks, but if you like, like tech you hear, what's it called again? It's a hand grip dynamometer. I'm grip gun and a done. No, I'm not a problem. I said, I'm a tough one. I'm a tough one. I'm a tough one. I'm a tough one. I'm a tough one. I'm a tough one. I'm a tough one. I'm a tough one. Action, and by me, an a terrible botched at West Coast version. Um, thank you. Well, we'll put that in the show notes also. Um, I think recovery is key. We always hear about sleep. Grow when you sleep and incidentally you're brain, you stimulate learning when you're awake, obviously, but the reordering of neural connections happens in sleep. This is why sleep is the way to get smarter. Provided you're also doing the learning part. This leads away to get stronger, provide you're also doing the training part. You've got some really, you've put out interesting content over the years in terms of even sleep position. One of the major changes that I made to my sleep behavior is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the road. Right. And I'll tell you, this had a profound impact on several things. First of all, my feet have always been the vein of my existence. Broke them a bunch, skateboarding. They, and I noticed when I'd run, I'd get shin splints and then I started to notice that my feet sort of you're the PT. They're kind of floppy. And you know, as if I was pointing my toes slightly all the time at rest, if I was. And I realized that based on listening to you previously, that my sheets were wrapped tight, not hotel tight. Right. Right. And what's the thing in the hotel's get a fit in? And I started releasing the sheets at the end of the bed. Yeah. And I also started doing some tibialis work. Yeah. Front of shin's work, essentially. Change everything. My back pain from running my shin splints disappeared. My posture improved although my audience will tell me that it still needs improvement. There are always five or ten people that wants it up straight. I've actually had chairs and tarman on their dress. Very nice chairs. I saw I'm trying my, I'm trying there. But this is fascinating. Right. The position that one sleeps in. I, unfortunately, any have never had any shoulder issues and I'll come wood. But maybe you could just talk, talk just a little bit about sleep and sleep position for sake of waking position and movement. This, I think, is a very unique and very powerful way to think about sleep. This podcast has done a lot of episodes about keeping the room cool, getting sunlight in your eyes, etc. How to get into sleep. But you've talked about physically what positions might be better to sleep in. So please, please, uh, enrich us. Yeah. I mean, first of all, there, you know, some people's opinions of that type of content is that you know, you sleep in the, the position that's most comfortable. So you ensure that you're sleeping. Oh, great. I understand that. We all want to sleep. That's the golden we put our head on the pillow. It's actually fall asleep and wake up in the morning and not know what that'll happen unless you had a dream. But, you know, beyond that, there are certainly physical components to sleep that that is why a lot of times people wake up and say like, that you can incur pretty serious injuries and sleep. People will wake up and have like a shoulder that did not bother them at all, be humming the next day or even for weeks after because of the one sleep position they put themselves in in a prolonged way and they happen to have a deep sleep even through the discomfort. Um, that can do actually some some damage. So it's understandable that the body can incur some strain and stress if you're sleeping in the wrong way. One of the things I say right off the, the bad is sleeping on your stomach doesn't really have many benefits. You know, you're, you're putting yourself into a position that is depending upon the, the, the orientation of your, your mattress or how many pillows you're using, put your basically putting yourselves into excessive extension a little on bar spine, which for most people isn't very good. If you're, if you're a disc patient, I guess that might be helpful, you know, for for relocating the disc, but I mean for the most part, your hands are then usually not at your sides, but they're up under your arms. So you've got them into sort of internal rotation up over elevation in your head. It's just not a great position. You also have to crank your neck for one side of the other in order to breathe or you're going to be your face down straight into the pillow. So I would skip that one. And there's some people that are total belly sleepers. And I, and I would just say, listen, I don't think that is the, the most helpful long-term way for you to sleep, try to adopt a different position. Sleeping on your side oftentimes is is also brought along with that. The legs knees coming up towards the chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen, we're doing enough of that during the day. Yeah, we're doing right now. We're doing it right now. We're doing it right now. We're doing it into the 10 hours, the right hours or something like that. You know, and it just is reinforcing, you know, and as we said too, you know, let's say you trained that day. You're just reinforcing muscle shortening overnight. You know, where the body is healing and trying to create some, you know, changes in your body. But one of the reasons why I recommend stretching or static stretching prior to going to bed. I people don't really want to do it at that point because it could take 10 minutes, five, 10 minutes. I'm gonna put in on how many muscles you have to stretch. But, It's good to sort of try to establish just longer length temporarily prior to going into a state where you're going to be not moving and recovering and creating new changes in the muscle. So, you know, that kind of, I don't say it doesn't rule out the side sleep, but the side sleeper could be very, very helpful for somebody that has apnea or other conditions. So, again, it's not at all or nothing approach, but it's just something that you need to pay attention to. When you are on your back, like you were talking about, and your feet are wedged underneath a tight sheets at the end of the bed. And most of us, unless we consciously are pulling them up, don't prefer our beds that have really loose sheets at the end of the bed. It's hard to make the bed in the morning. Right. So, it's like you're going to want to have, you know, them tight. Well, I'm saying, as you experienced, you know, you're going to have these, these, you know, prolonged plenary flexion that's going to likely lead to shorter, you know, calves over time. Because you're lacking all that length for that long period of time that you could have if you just loosened up the sheets and allowed your feet to just, you know, hang out where they are. Now, the resting position of the ankle is not endorsed the flexion is going to be still in some plenary flexion, but not being driven down and pulled down into that position. And I think what happens actually is people who get uncomfortable that way, even in their sleep will shift away from that by turning either onto their side or stomach. So, there's definitely an impact of the body position in sleep and figuring out the best way that you can still sleep, of course, and get your rest. But have a line of fly towards what is doing to your body and choose the one that's least, you know, abrasive to your body is the way you should go. Terrific and again, it's really helped me and I'm a big believer based on good science out of Stanford and elsewhere that, you know, as much as we can be nasal breathers and sleep, we probably should be, I don't know if you've done any content about you're taping the mouth shut with some medical tape, but you know, the benefits of nasal breathing and sleep are pretty tremendous, but it takes a little bit of training for people to do and that training is very simple, it's a little piece of medical tape. So, again, a topic for another time. I'm glad you mentioned stretching, I was going to ask about stretching a little bit later, but let's talk about stretching. When's the best time to stretch for particular types of results and maybe you could define some of the different types of stretching. So you just mentioned a little bit of, would you call it light stretching or, okay, I'm completely naive here on stretching, so let me just say I can think of stretching where I hold the stretch and really try and lengthen in air quotes. So I want the PT's jumping all over it. I don't know what it is, but nutrition and the PT's online are really, they've got pitchforks in both hands. That's the recent, that's the recent evolution I think. And that's the interesting as much, but the PT's have become a little bit angry these days. I see, well, I always say with feelings of powerlessness comes aggression, very good, folks. So in any case, they're stretching where I'm, you know, trying to consciously lengthen again in air quotes, the muscle, I'm not yanking on the limb or bobbing up and down. Maybe you could define the different types of stretching for people. Maybe give us some rough guidelines about whether or not to do it cold or warm before training after training, etc. So yeah, there's obviously there's a lot of different types of stretching there. You could get even to, you know, p and f stretching and things that are a little bit more, you know, niche, but like in general, the two basic forms of stretching are active stretching and passive stretching. And you're, you know, your dynamic work and your passive stretching is done with the goal of trying to create an increase in the flexibility of the muscle. So whether you're actually increasing the length of that muscle or, you know, more so what you're doing is increasing the resist, or decreasing the resistance of that muscle to one and stay at a certain level of flexibility. So when we can sort of take the breaks off and allow that muscle to allow us more range of motion, we're inherently increasing flexibility without necessarily having to increase the length of that muscle. That is usually done at a time far away from your workout because they have shown where this type of stretching done prior to an activity. And it could be like a structured activity like lifting or it could be a little bit less structured like competing in a sport in a spontaneous type way. That there is a period of recalibration that is needed after doing this because you're disrupting the length and relationship with the muscle that causes you to not necessarily be able to rely on these. So if you talk about before stored motor and grums in your mind in terms of this is the pattern for how I swing a golf club say, you know, and now introducing a little bit of flexibility or add a flexibility or range because of the stretching I did before. It takes maybe a whole or two or three to match up again. Oh, this is the, this is what he's trying to do that golf swing thing I that I remember again, like it's not remembering the every component like I have to bend my right wrist back 10 degrees and then I have to bend my elbow and I have to break. Like your body stores these patterns for motor efficiency. So and when I have to start matching up that stored pattern with what's feeling new because of the increased range. I can then pair a performance and again, it could happen even a gym workout where you're talking about your first second set there is set. Where maybe the repercussions aren't as big because I'll just do a few extra sets but in performance if you screw up your first three rounds you play on a PJ tour and you shoot you're six over after three you're you're done, you know. So I think it matters there. As far as the dynamic you know, so we relegate that as I mentioned sort of towards the end of the day when it's not going to impact performance. But even maybe have the additional benefit of creating the the feeling of length or the increase or decrease in resistance to this length. At a time when I know my body is going to try to tend to heal and heal shorter never longer but heal shorter. So if I can introduce a little bit of that extra length or or decrease resistance to that length it's a better time to do it. So I think it promotes a better recovery. If I want to start sorry to interrupt us. Stretching later in the day because I'm intrigued by this concept of heal shorter. So part of the healing and recovery process means a shortening of the muscles. This is the tensing up and sleep. Could you elaborate just a bit on that and then sorry to break your flow, but then. So you know just basically you know what was been shown is that when when the repair process musk the repair from let's say strength training during the day. The repair process usually results in a muscle that is slightly shorter rather than increased in length. You know it's just that it's you know muscles prefer to sort of you know ratchet their way down into that that contraction and then. You know maintain that that that more comfortable length tension relationship. So when you're sleeping it tends to you know air on the side of shorter rather than longer when ideally we don't really want that we want to maintain is much of that length because with more length. We actually have more leverage right that muscle has more leverage to contract if it was all the way contracted you know you really can't obviously we know generate much force and a muscle that's already maximally contracted. So I think we we want to do something that we whatever we can whatever little weapons we have in our arsenal that could allow us to do this prior to sleep and again it's just making a conscious choice to do it a time of the day that makes a little bit more sense. Dynamic stretching is really not done for that purpose of trying to create any type of of feeling of. Increasing the the potential length as you said of the muscle but more so the readiness of the muscle to perform. And increasing you know exploring the ends of that range of motion in a more dynamic way so you're not hanging out there and disrupting that length tension relationship is just sort of touching the ends of those barriers so that when you feel movement again. It feels looser it feels more ready and obviously the same time warming up blood flow all the benefits we get from just warming up in general so like you know that's that's the series you've probably seen a bunch of times but like. You know legs wings and you know butt kicks and you know lung walking lunges and all type of touches toe touches all those kind of drills those active stretching drills or. You know lunging with rotations of the upper body to try to get some of the thoracic spine involved to those are the drills that people will do prior to training that are both excitatory in terms of just the nervous system but also helpful for just the general warm up the body because the blood flow. But from a muscle ready to standpoint not impairing the performance while the same time exploring the increased ranges because as you know the first. To touch you do is not as high as the last touch touch you do. It doesn't even include the. The chin touch touch attempt. Right. So like you know those those are going to improve with each subsequent rep and I think that's what people actually like you when you can see those. Those actual changes from rep one to rep seven. You just feel ready you feel more alert and ready to go and you're workout. So the dynamic type of stretching. And I mentioned earlier on you know like what I've had to do to sort of increase my warm up focus. You know I think that's more of what I try to do these days. I try to be a little bit more alert to the fact that. You know my body's not ready. When I was when I was working with Antonio Brown I remember like he would spend 20 minutes 30 minutes on all dynamic work. And I've never seen anybody spend that long on their dynamic work but like. He said he just didn't feel right and ready to go unless he did a lot of that and I mean you know his his dynamic stretching routine would be a workout for most everybody. You know it's crazy how much he did. These pro athletes are amazing and you've had the great fortune of working with and improving their their abilities. But I can only imagine because I also imagine he's pretty strong in the gym also. I mean you know it's only it always makes me the guys that make it to that level no matter what sport they do. They're so gifted in everything you know like David Wright used to make me laugh all the time with the meds because. No matter what I ping pong you know like anything he because of his hand I coordination like anything you know great at jump rope. I remember he hadn't done a lot of jump rope and I I think jump rope's one of the best things you could do from a conditioning standpoint. It's actually fairly interesting is not just you know it's not too harsh on the joints depending on you know even though it's a ballistic move. And he wasn't after me that you know if you listen to this he's gonna want to kill me but I was better at him than jump ropeing when the only things I could do. And then I gave him about five days and he completely blew me out of the water to the point where I could never keep up with him anymore. He made it look effortless it's like that's where the athlete in someone comes out no matter what they pick up they're good at it. And I think that when you see guys like this in the gym like their strength levels tend to be pretty damn good and their abilities or coordination their their everything just tends to sort of be good at that level you know and it sort of amazing me why those guys can go pick up a golf club. You know and go shoot 72 you know and and having never really played you know they're just they're just naturally good at whatever they do. Yeah, I have a couple I'm smiling because I have a couple really close friends who did a number of years some several decades in the seal teams and I don't know that there's skill level at everything is so high as as you're describing for athletes but their level of competitiveness is beyond. I oceans one with one there's no chance that I'm gonna you know out swim pat ever ever he actually goes back and forth sometimes just check up on me. I'm which I appreciate thank you Pat I'm in the round yet but the but in addition to that you know we could play horseshoes and it's like this switch that just flips on like he's gonna murder. Very nice guy right in general they tend to be honest but but the level of competitiveness. Well they're fun real they're trying to beat themselves and I'm trying to beat you that's right I'm not even in the time of the competition you're not even there. Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Now we'll feel. It's true it's a remarkable thing I'm glad you mentioned jump rope thing I used to skip rope for warm up for boxing. Yeah, yeah, it was typically like three or three minute rounds or something like that but I'm glad you brought it up because skipping rope is something that obviously has a cardiovascular component there's the condition component there's timing and and it is kind of interesting. Right you can it's frustrating when you don't get it especially on the air if you're using a proper rope. I'm just curious if you could just give us a quick skipping rope one on one you like to see people jumping with both feet and toes will we'll link to a video if I'm sure if there was one and I missed it. Do you like to see people doing high knees you like people basically like shuffling you want to see people doing double dodge what do you want to see people doing over time. All of the above maybe not double dodge but all all the above I mean I think that that's the cool thing about it right like once we sort of master the skill because for all of us that. First jump with the two feet going together is a challenge because you just got time that rope you got time you jump and then we get bored as we often do as humans we get bored what we can doing what I take on new challenges so then it becomes one like at a time or then it becomes side to side hops right all those things are beneficial. I believe neurologically to enhancing the ability to do the skill as a whole but also just because. I'm such a believer in training in all three planes so like just doing straight up and down versus now I can do front to plane side to side motion and then I can even do small little twists or corkscrews recall them. It requires a different you would know more about better than I do there requires different neurological patterns to be able to coordinate that because you're changing the orientation of your body in space so it's not just. I'm changing the exercise but I'm changing how my body interprets that exercise because what's happened to my body in space so I I love you know whatever people lined up doing but I am amazed there are people I just started following this young woman on instagram who is like. I give her a plug out of these like Anna skips or something and she is ridiculous like I watch her and I'm like mesmerized of what she can do with the rope you know it's it's like. Is extremely athletic endeavor believe when it gets to be at that level in the speed and the precision in the you know and and you know I think one of the goals that you want to be able to have is. To where you're feeling is if you're almost effortlessly dancing without a rope like where you're just bouncing off of the ball of your foot. It's an important skill to learn to whether you go back to run or you know or even even jog right just like you know more casual running learning how to land is so important. One of the drills that people should try is like try to jump on your heels so just stand up pull your toes off the ground. All right and just jump from your heels and land on your heels you'll feel it in your jaw you'll really feel your jaw rattle when you land on your heels there is no shock absorption capabilities through your heels mean time a lot of people land on their heels a lot when they when they run and you're just your bodies not built to absorb the forces like the ball of your foot could it's really built as a spring. And the in the foot is a to me as a physical therapist the foot is always being one of the most you know you talk about having bad feet I have flat feet it looks like I got flippers if I took my if I took my shoes off like I like learn when wearing scuba fence. There is no there is no adaptability of that foot to the surface you know when it's completely caved and flattened like that the job of this of the foot is to be adaptable well there is maybe there is some adaptability because it's so floppy. By the same time at some point that critical junction when you're going to then step through and you need to be able to push off the foot has to actually changes in the mid foot itself to become. A rigid lever as if they call it you're you're going from a mobile adapter to a rigid lever that rigid lever literally locks up the mid-tarsal joint to become solid so that you can push off of it with leverage. If you lack that capability all those stresses that are supposed to be born by the foot go up into the ankle into the knee into the hip into the low back. So learning how to land and start to train your your body to a to experience ground reaction forces the right way. Is so critical to all other function and all their disability up the Canadian chain and jumping rope is like one of the best ways to learn how to do that great. I I own a jump rope I'd love doing it in the morning while I get sunlight in my eyes it's actually a protocol I picked up from Tim Ferriss. The mentioned because you know listeners of my podcast and I'm like a broken record with get sunlight in your eyes even through cloud cover it's just sets your sleep rhythms and your waking rhythms of the yada on and on. But sometimes they be kind of boring for people and I want to get them off their phone so jumping ropes also just a great way to wake up. So jumping rope can be a the cardio workout the 50 or 30 minutes. I mean there's sort of that hybrid that we're talking about before like you're not you're not necessarily dropping down to the ground doing burpees, but I just look at it as a more athletic endeavor because of the coordination involved. Then just simply walking or jogging. And you it's not much of a equipment requirement very minimal cost could even use a rope or for something if you. Although we even struck people that he used no rope and just pretend. You know and just move the arms right. You're never going to hit the rope which is good, but you know at the same time. So you're never going to know if you're doing it wrong, but at least you can you can move through the and get the same benefits through the feet. I love it. I love it. I told myself before sitting down with you today that I wasn't going to focus on specific exercises because there's such a wealth of incredible content that you put out there that people could just put into YouTube or elsewhere and arrive at the proper way to do a channel or a differ. For whatever purpose, but there's one exercise in one particular motion that I'd like to discuss for a moment because I believe that. Learning about this cautionary note from you is one of the reasons that I've maintained steady training for 30 years with no major injury knock on wood. And that's the upright row. You know one thing that whether or not be weight trainer or not. I'm going to say to this podcast and since we need to be this out or no. Do you get beef about this? No, you know what? We always get beef in any social media platform where we're put out, but like, no, I guess I get some from it, but I'm fully prepared to defend myself. So, but here's the reason for asking about this. I never really cared much for upright rows. It's not exercise I tend to do, but one thing that's apparent in all my colleagues and every child I see and every adult I see is that. Almost everybody is an inward rotation now. So folks think if you stay, I think I learned this from you also. If you stand up straight and then you just point your thumbs out like a thumbs up, but you're just pointing your hands are down. Your point your thumbs straight out. Ideally, they would go straight out. Most people, the thumbs are going to be pointing toward one another because most people are starting to look somewhere between a. A non human primate and a melted candle. Yeah. You know, bent at the hips, it's out of the right from too much sitting. We're all sitting, we're an inward rotation, but I learned from you that the upright road compromises some important aspects of our shoulder mechanics and can be actually sort of a dangerous movement in some ways. I'm sure there's a safe way for people to do it. But so I've always made it a point now on the basis of this advice to a not do upright rows, but I wasn't doing them before, but to really strive for external rotation on things like bench dips on a number of different things. Whenever I can, I try and go into external rotation and provide you know, without looking like an idiot walking around with my palms facing outward. Please tell us about internal external rotation. The upright row is one aspect of that, but why this is so important, not just for weight training, but as it terms a posture in mechanics and not looking like a melted candle or partially melted candle. I actually love it. I am happy to talk about it because I love, I love the shoulder as a joint. I think the PT is tend to fall in love with certain areas and the shoulders one of the cool areas for me, it's like the foot is, but like the shoulder has the most mobility in the body of any of any joint. But it's also got the least stability, right? There's always that trade-off of mobility, instability. So, your stability comes from you know, certain muscle groups and one of the ones that the only muscle group that you know, the only muscle group that actually externally rotates, the shoulder is going to be the rotator cuff, okay? And unless you're devoted to training through external rotation, it exercises that are going to externally rotate the shoulder, you're not training that function. And it's so easy for us in everyday life, especially those that aren't training, to not ever really undergo any of those stresses that could be beneficial to counteracting what happens freely and naturally, which is internal rotation. So, when you think about the imbalance created just by nature and how we live our lives, internal rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation, so you need to address it. And the reason why you need to address it is because you need to normalize those bio mechanics to the shoulder if you want their long-term health. And one of the functions of the shoulder is to raise our arm up over our head. And if we do that from an intranely rotated position, we're going to have a higher likelihood of creating stress inside that joint. Funny thing is, I talked about before my PT brethren, you can be somewhat angry these days, I don't know what happened, but further angry, you know, they want to discredit the existence of something like shoulder impingement, which I don't know how, I mean, certain study, look at we both, we all read studies and we studies will say one thing one day and potentially conflict entirely in a different direction. Some studies will point to the non-existence of a shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, we have, thankfully, digital motion x-rays that will literally show the impingement occur in real time, in real function. And that's one of the limitations I'm off on a tangent here, but like those types of x-rays are that type of fluoroscopy that we have nowadays. Like, gives us such insight that we never have before because we're taking static x-rays as someone laying down on a table. You know, when I want to see what happens when he actually raised my arm up over my head, in function and they end the tools now exist to do that. We see that the problems occurring because in order to get normal mechanics and free up the joint maximally inside, you need to external rotate as you raise the arm up. So if your muscles aren't firing and they're not necessarily as strong as the internal rotation bias that pulls them in, you're asking for trouble every time you do that. Well, this exercise is literally putting you in elevation and internal rotation. And if you were to walk into a PT office and someone said, I think he's got an impingement. Will you diagnose him? There's a test called a Hawkins Kennedy test. And I would put you in the position. I know we're not visible at this point through the podcast, but I'll put you in this position here. Where I have your arm elevated and your hand pretty much under your chin, pushing downward on that to create that internal shoulder rotation. Pretty much the exact position that we're in when we're holding a bar in an upright row. Some will say, well, just don't go so high, go only up to the level of the chest, but you're still in this intralial rotated position. The thing that I think frustrates me the most about the exercises that I have an alternative. And the alternative does the same thing in terms of helping the muscles grow by simply fixing the bio mechanics to the exercise, but just allowing the hands to go higher than the elbows. So instead of the elbows being higher than the hand, which drives you into interrotation, if the elbow is lower than the hand, the hand being higher here, I'm an extra rotation. And I could do something called a high pull and still get the same abduction of the arm and still get the same benefits of the shoulders, the delts and the traps without having to undergo any of the stresses that would come from the somewhat awkward movement of an upright row. And for those listening, we'll put a link to a short clip of what this looks like, but basically what Jeff is doing and tell me if I'm describing this incorrectly or correctly Jeff is taking your two thumbs and pointing behind you and, you know, so elbows up kind of near the chin and pointing behind you like, go ahead of that way. Like somebody directing the airplane like come back and back and back. I feel like what they call that is I think it's called semifurin is the action of like where they direct the planes or something. And so if you're talking about the planes or whatever someone will of course tell me I'm wrong about that too, which is why I say these things because I like being told what the correct answer is. In any case, so this replaces the upright row and probably doesn't number of other important things as well. Again, listen, when I without naming names or programs or anything that when I got involved and when I got involved in in athlete next time, I first started you know my online presence. There was a very very very popular program that was out there that I just for fun, I wanted to as a PT, the nerdy things we do, but I wanted to evaluate the workout structure and I went and I looked at every wrap over the course of a week. And there were something like you know, 890 repetitions or something done and zero of them were dedicated external rotation of the shoulder. So if you think about it, I mean, it was a very popular program that was done by a lot of people, there is no there was no focus at all, no dedicated focus towards creating a balance to an action that is so predominant. And remember it's not just because we sit with that posture, but the fact that our chest can internally rotate our lats can internally rotate. There's like muscle other big muscles that participate in things that we do every day that will further internally rotate the shoulder. The only weapons we have for external rotation are those little rotator cuff muscles and three of them actually three of the four. And the job is to sort of actively and consciously train them through really the boring exercises, right? Like you've seen them with the band you you anchor a band to a pole you stand with the band in the opposite hand. So if it's anchored to the pole on my left side, I've got the band in my right side and you see people where they kind of rotate their hand towards the back. Again kind of what you're saying, but at a lower elevation, taking the back of my hand to try to point it to somebody behind me. Well, you know, that is that it is one of the ways to train the muscle. It's just a one function of the shoulder external rotation of the shoulder and you need to do it. And again, it's not that if somebody was doing more external rotation work could they absorb the upright row better probably because as they elevated the arm, they probably have a little bit more of a contribution from the rotator cuff. And so to what one of the functions is to centralize the head of the humorous inside of the Glenoid, you know, the capsule. So as it rises up, it stays central as opposed to migrating up because the deltoid likes to pull up. So if the rotator cuff has some ability to counteract the upward pull of the del. So it can maintain a more healthy relationship with overhead movement. So just realizing that that that that functions only gain through doing these exercises. You know, we would probably dedicate more time there, but the rotator the upright row might be better absorbed by that person because they have a little bit more strain. But again, why? Because if you have an exercise that does the same thing for what you're trying to do musculially to build the muscles that it affects. Why wouldn't you just do it where you can still see actually pick up more repetitions of external rotation. You know, so you're getting none of the harm all of the benefits. I see zero reason to ever do the upright row. And people will argue, this is the way they argue that I've done this for 30 years and I've never hurt myself. And I always say, yeah, yeah, like I listen, the goal is to not hurt yourself ever. So even if you, it's sort of like, you know, the championship game, you know, you might play the game of your life, but if you lose you lost. And when you get into the end of the, you know, the record books, you're still lost. So even if you had the game of your life, you lost. I don't care if you do it for 30 years, no pain. You're still doing it. And there's no pain. I'm giving you an option that's going to give you the same results and the exercise that you're seeking. That's why you're doing the exercise without the possibility of having the, you know, the bad outcome from it. So, you know, I get a little bit, you know, defensive of the, of the, of the move, but I feel like it's like why would you do that, you know? It makes, it makes, it makes, it makes us being able to train for a long period of time and feel good, you know, no, I, I, I'm proud to say, you know, and I don't have the kind of genetics, we're like we don't have a lot of impressive athletes in our family tree or anything. There's, you know, some fit individuals, some less fit individuals, but I really believe it's about putting in the work consistently over time. And the more, the more often you can wake up not in pain, the better. So, you know, I think that being an external rotation has often as possible is good. This is actually a good friend who's a yoga teacher told me this is also a problem with the yogis, you know, a lot of all the downward dog stuff. For those listening, you can think of inward rotation as like thumbs down, just like thumbs down and mergotation doesn't bad, but less thumbs down more thumbs up as external rotation. So for those just listening, maybe that gives a visual, the more exercise you can do an external rotation, the better it seems on average. I'd love to chat with you just a little bit more about biomechanics and this is a personal thing that again, your content really helped solve for me. One is, I thought I had lower back pain, but I had sciatica, so badly that on a few trips, I worked trips years ago when I was doing a lot more international travel. I mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes. I mean, really excruciating pain. I didn't want to take medication. I wanted to do back surgery. In the end, turns out it wasn't a back injury at all. And one of the things that helped fix it was just learning about this thing called the medial glute. And you had a video that said, fix back pain and then you quite accurately saved that some back pain isn't really about the back at all. And had me do an exercise or allowed me to try an exercise where I lay on my side and since she pointed my toe down and a top toe down almost like pointing a toe down. And then would slowly lift the leg up while pointing the toe down. Maybe I got it. You're correct. And then holding that and there's a muscle that sort of sits at the top of the glute. It kind of peaks out every once in a while. You can feel it there with your thumb, which is I think you had push back on it. Yeah, but creating that mind muscle link again and there with proprioception, the actual feeling of a muscle literally with it with a limb. We know the based on the neural circuits for movement that that enhances the contract all ability of a muscle. So like if you touch your bicep, you literally can contract it more strongly. And this makes total sense based on neuro muscular physiology. So having to do that repeatedly. I started doing that in my hotel room and the pain started to disappear. And then it came back again the afternoon. So I did it again in the afternoon. So this is something I did for three or four days and loan behold a back pain's gone. I handed this off to my father because he like me has a slightly lower right shoulder. I think our gate is probably thrown off by this is probably genetic who knows. He handed off to somebody. You know it turns out that we don't suffer from back pain. And in fact now I don't suffer from rain pain because I was doing this exercise, which I think is helping my low of my medial glute. Two reasons why I raised this one. I know a lot of guys who have this right side sciatica because people keep the wallet there is one idea or left side sciatica. There are a lot of people male and female who think they have back pain when they don't actually have back pain. And the other thing is that is about a general question about biomechanics or statement about biomechanics. I had of a feeling that a lot of what people think is back pain or knee pain or neck pain or headache or shoulder pain is actually. The consequence of something that's happening above or below that side of pain. And this is a whole landscape of stuff related to PT and recovery and pain management. But maybe you just educate us a bit on this and why this works. What is the medial glute? Why did it make my so called back pain disappear? And how should people think about pain? And I like to use this segue to get into deeper discussion about pain and recovery. So this is definitely like a big cornucopia of PT stuff here. But like this is why I love. So first of all that video, it's my proudest video that I have. And the reason being is that it's helped so many people. Like we get comments on that video every day. I don't know how many of you have just got an out 30, some of it. There's a lot of you will link to it. There's a lot of you. And why honestly it was a little bit of an afterthought video in terms of it's origin. I think that that day maybe Jesse was having some problems or something like that a little bit of low back pain. And I showed him and it helped right away. I was like, well, we can make a video on it because this will help people. You know, not everybody. If you have a real disc problem that's not going to help. You know, because you're not changing the structural problem that's there. But as you said, a lot of people don't, you know, and even in disc issues, you know, a lot of them are not operatives. So you would want to try these things first. As far as what you're sort of experienced, sometimes that's that gloop media is really tight and it's down. And that's that's again from poor bio mechanics up and down the Canadian chain. It can actually press on the sciatic nerve and give you what they call pseudo sciatica. You know, where it is. And I like you're you're making it up. It's not like you're not feeling that pain over that same sciatic distribution. But it's not caused from a disc. It's not caused from something mechanical there. It's caused by the fact that this gloop media has has posthently become a problem for you or weak, you know, because you don't train it. And you need to address it. So like unlike not unlike any other muscle in the body, there are common trigger points in common areas where the muscle will become tightened or painful or spasm. And you can basically apply pressure to these areas to and then sort of thread that muscle through the pressure by pushing down through there. And then contract in the muscle, which is why you go through that action of, you know, I think we call it tostabber, but like stabbing down and lifting up and stabbing down and lifting up, making that gloop media through its function. So there's basically kind of working underneath the downward pressure of the finger. And that tends to help you to almost, you know, need out what might be that trigger point. And that's why people can see immediate relief there because once the trigger point lets go, it feels like, in that's what the comments are on that video like my god. I couldn't walk, I but on my hotel floor. I did this and I'm fixed. And meanwhile, then, you know, it could come back because your body is like, well, I like being more like this, this is how I've been, you know, in grain to be. So I might come back, but then when you do another round of it and another round of it, and then finally it starts to say, alright, I'm not going to do that anymore. It kind of eases up and you can relieve yourself of those trigger points. You can do that up and down the back, there's other people that get that in that sort of inside their shoulder blade, you know, that same type of cramping in another area. But once that takes place, well, then the job that I think people have is like, become educated that, you know, the gloom media is different than the gloom axiomists. You know, like, their functions are different. You know, you have to work on not just extending the hip, but also abduction of the hip, external rotation of the hip. Same thing as in the shoulder. And this is actually segway nicely into what into the whole concept you were talking about. Like, the body is like a mirror image. The hip is like the shoulder, right? The ankle is the wrist. The foot is the hand. Like they're, they're, they funk the knee is the elbow, they're two hinge joints. They function that way. Well, with the shoulder, you've got that mobility that comes from having all that freedom of motion, but the stability is lacking. Well, the same thing with the hip. Like you've got mobility, but if you don't fully stabilize it by training all the muscles of the hip, and if you don't strengthen the external rotation of the hip, then, you know, you're, you're going to have issues. Like it's not biomechanically going to work the same way. If you think of the body as a series of, you know, bands, you know, pulling in different directions at different levels of tension, you know, you're being pulled into one direction of the other, just by the balance of tension from one week area to one, dominantly tight area. And you need to make sure that you can sort of balance this out in order to eliminate some of the adaptations and compensations that happen. So what I say when we look at sort of the, the body as a whole, most often wherever you're feeling the pain is absolutely not to blame. There's not to blame. It is somewhere above or below as you hint to that. You know, you're talking about the, the knee is like my favorite example of it. Whenever you have knee pain, I tell you 10 and I just, which I have forever. I've had a, you know, bad bad cases of 10 and I just were squatting is very difficult for me. It's not the knee, the knee is the knee is literally a hinge joint that, you know, there's, there's a minor rotation capabilities and knee, but it's a hinge joint. And it's being impacted by the hip and the ankle and the foot, as I said before, how critical the foot is. If you thought of the, of the knee being the, like the middle of a train track, where the femur down your thigh and your shin down below your knee, where the train track, what happened if the foot collapses at the bottom, all of a sudden that train track on the bottom gets torqued just a little bit. Well, who's going to feel that the most, the area where it's torquing, which is at the knee? So the stresses are going to be felt there. Meanwhile, the problem is the foot or the problem is the ankle. People that are chronic ankle sprainers, you know, are almost always going to wind up having back pain because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations in the ankle, that then gets connected through the chain because now, once I distort the ankle in the shin, now the knee is trying to maintain its ability to hinge smoothly. So it torques on the femur to do that. Well, the femur is now inside the hip joint pulling on the pelvis and the pelvis is at a wax. So it's really, it's really as fascinating. Like it's one of my favorite things about how the body works is like how it interconnected it is and how one little thing somewhere causes repercussions somewhere else. And the easiest way to find out what your problem is is to say, okay, I know where my symptom is, but I got to find someone who can help me find the source somewhere else because it is going to be usually either above or below. Mostly usually below because it usually translates up to kinetic chain. But usually it's going to be below where the real source is. So people with low back pain usually have hip issues. Weakness is tightness is flexibility issues. It's almost always below. When you get to really high performance athletics though, it almost works the other way. Like where we have pictures who can't, I mean, I'm always fascinated by guys that have Tommy John issues, you know, in their elbow right pictures like if you can't externally rotate the shoulder that we talked about again, the ability to get your shoulder back and the external rotation. Well, your arm has to get to a certain position for release of the baseball and if it can't get there because you can't externally rotate the shoulder to get there, then the elbow has to sort of torque more in order to allow the arm to get back further. And it will try to take some of that motion from a joint that's not really again another, you know, the hinge joint really capable of doing that. So it starts to stress that media level ligament to get a little bit further back because the shoulders not working. And that just ultimately places trying the elbow. So when you see a guy that has pain that floats around a picture that floats around their arm, all that is is sort of this balance of compensation. Once his elbow starts hurting, then he can't do the range from the elbow. So he tries to dig a little bit further back in text or rotation and then the rotator cuff gets inflamed. And then he feels that's inflamed. So by the way, during that time period, it takes some of the straight out the elbow so the elbow feels better. And he decides, okay, now I got the extra rotation, but I'm getting too much of that. So now I start strain in the elbow again and it keeps going through this cycle. So your body is very smart and it's going to compensate every single time. It's going to find the compensation, but there's no guarantee that that compensation doesn't leave you with a whole host of other issues. Yeah, it's fascinating. And another lifetime I would have gone and been a PT, although it sounds like the community of among PT's online. But they're with the listeners. We're with people, but it's like, yeah, scientists and neuroscientists can get into pretty intense battles. You know, coming from the academic community, you know, the etiquette is so different online because I was saying, you know, I think in person, people would probably behave a bit differently. You're hand and say hello. Yeah, he's a good hand and say hello. And and there's also, look, I'll just be very direct about this. There are a lot of people online for whom they're only content is pointing out the misunderstandings or alleged flaws of other people. There's like the, it where it's like that bulk of their identities, which to me is sort of a sad existence, but, you know, there's always more to gain by thinking about what's possible and what's new and what's good. Yeah, but you know, teach their own demise or win. I mean, questioning what's out there is help sure. It's normal is great. It actually sparse conversation. But as you said, some people's existence is solely to find things to, you know, nag about and not actually with the goal being to advance anything, but rather just to, you know, Yeah, in the world of science being skeptical, but not cynical is encouraged. But I always say that the longer that somebody's in a career path, it certainly in science or medicine, and they realize how hard it is to, you know, to do various studies. Once they publish a few studies, generally they sort of get a better understanding of how the various things are done. In any case, another, along the lines of, of pain and pain relief and misunderstandings about the origins of pain and the body, one of the great tools that I picked up from your content, which is benefit. I know in a huge number of people is, I think I used to hold weights sometimes in the tips of my fingers as opposed to in the meat of the palm of my hands, and I had elbow pain. And I always thought that I felt it most on tri-step exercises and pushing exercise, and I thought I was doing those exercises wrong. Turns out I tore the end of my pull ups or my bicep work. I was letting the weight or the bar drift into my fingertips. Yeah. And the mere shift to making sure that my knuckles were well over the bar or that the weight was really in the meat of my palms, because completely ameliorated that. For reasons that you point out and maybe you could just share with us why that is, you know, this kind of finger pull exercise. Usually when someone says pull my finger, it's like a bad middle school or a elementary school joke. Well, this is what I've pushed your finger. Yeah, right. Yeah, this is fascinating. This is because it just shows again how intricate the body is and how responsive or over-responsive it can be to something so little. And, you know, what you're talking about is that when you grip a bar where there'd be through a curl or where there'd be, and this is mostly pulling exercises, because the tendency for the bar is going to be too fall out of your hand, not like with pushing exercise, where it's kind of, you're pushing your hand into the bar. So on a bench press say, that bar can drift just by gravity, we're doing it doing it's thing or fatigue of the hand grip strength. So we start to drift further away towards the distal digits, right, through those last couple knuckles that we have on our hands. And though our hand can still hold it there, the muscles are not equipped to handle those types of loads. And that can start at a very, I'm not going to say, light, but like, you know, it can start it, you know, dumbbell weight, you know, 40 pounds, 30 pounds, you know, even 25 pounds, or something depending upon the overall strength levels. But then when you start to apply it to something like your body weight with a chin up, right, because that's natural for the bar to somewhat kind of float down towards your fingertips. And it actually is a little bit easier to perform the exercise with that sort of like fall grip little hook grip at the end, because you're not going to engage the forearms into the exercise, you're not going to start pulling down. But at the same time, while it could help you to perform them better by getting the back more activated, if you have weakness in these muscles, because it's not a thing that happens to, if it's not one of those upright row type things where I think this is happening to everybody. This is happening to people that have these inherent weaknesses in this in this in these muscles. You or having done enough of the gripping in the fore in the middle of the hand, you know, for long enough, but it starts to put that stress on these muscles that are ill-equipped to do this. And to handle this, and it starts to, it's particularly on that fourth finger, you know, which is part of the muscle we call the FDS, the flexor digital that is just too much for the handle. And that comes all the way down and meets right at the middle elbow, right on that spot that you can say feels like someone's knifeing you right in the middle in that middle elbow. And in middle, up kind of the lightest sort of they call it golf or cell, though, is something that a lot of us deal with in the gym. It's one of the most common inflammatory conditions people get from the gym, and it all comes from this positioning of the dumbbell or barbell or hand on a pull up bar over time. So the easiest thing to do is just grip deeper so that what you're doing is you're using more leverage from the palm to encapsulate the bar or the dumbbell or whatever, and you're not putting that pressure really distally right on that last digit because that's where the that FDS muscle is most strained. So you're just almost eliminating that from the equation. And it's one of those exercises that the load can exceed its capacity pretty quickly, so that like, you know, it may be a selling cable of handling 30 pounds. And then when you're doing a chin up and it goes and it drifts so far that it's now you're the say you're 200 pound guy. You've got, let's say, a hundred pounds through one arm and a hundred pounds. This is simple to simplify math that obviously is all set by other muscles, but hundred pounds to one arm, a hundred pounds off of a muscle that can handle 30 is not going to take many repetitions to strain it. And you're going to feel that maybe by the time that sets over or certainly by the time that workouts over the next day you wake up, you've got that notable stabbing pain. For someone feels that the best thing would be to determine, okay, what exercise would I do that we're pulling and where the bar could have drifted deeper. And further from the me to my palm into my fingers and figure out a way that deep in that grip when that happens though the best thing to do with most of these inflammatory conditions is not do any of that stuff for a little while. Ever just for a little while there's always things that you can do around it. I'm not saying ever do I say like don't go to the gym or don't find something you can do. But I'm saying that particular exercise that you feel the pain on while you're doing it never smart idea to do that exercise when it's inflamed. If you are doing exercise and it hurts you probably shouldn't do the exercise because another, you know, the reason for the variability of exercises there's so many other options that you can do that will train similar muscles or even the same motion and not cause that stress. So I mean a cable cable curl would be much easier to do that on than let's say a chin up where you don't have the control over the weight like you do by moving a pin on a stack. So you know I think that that that is a common thing that people find and the best thing to do is just figure out how deep are you gripping that bar you're going to find that oh my god I didn't realize that because it was just even though you might start a set in a good position and it drifts away as you go. Yeah I think that's what was happening me and I'm very conscious of this now and again for me it's I haven't had this elbow pain at all so that's great you know very fortunate so again a dead a gratitude to you never I thought there's some wrong in my elbow basically. And I thought maybe with tennis elbow I don't even play tennis so there you go. And other aspects of recovery and very variables for recovery I think you and I both put out content about the use of cold and I think we can summarize it by saying yeah does seem like cold water immersion immediately after. Hiperch of your strains workouts might be a problem but a cold shower is probably not a problem. What about heat. Do you do you personally use heat and cold. You know, hot baths hot compresses you and by you do I mean you personally and athletes that you coach or people that you coach. What are your thoughts on the use of heat and or cold? Well I think you know it might just be inherited practice from the days of you know trainers of you know since the baby with you know what we in baseball we used a lot of cold following performance you know just because. The idea would be there there is some especially pictures you know there is some inflammation that is abnormal you know the arm is not really designed to do what they do especially at the at the speed that they move it and everything else so we would use you know ice as a pretty standard practice after that. But not not a lot of heat you know and I use a lot of heat and of course from the recovery or the healing aspect that actually becomes rather personal preference they found now. After let's say the first 12 to 24 hours you know where you really trying to control information of what you know might be an injury but then it then it can kind of shift the personal preference because the heat can bring blood to the area also and then the you know the cold has it sort of anti. Inflammatory effects like there's a balance between which ones working better for you so there's really no standard anymore for heat or cold in that way but from a standpoint of like post workout healthy status. I haven't used much heat or cold in terms of what we do you know we cover the topic of the cold showers and to try to dispel the myth of the. You know even people saying that there's trying testosterone releases and you know all kinds of stuff that you know listening to hear all kinds of things because people like I think. The idea just turn in the water cold and be in it for 30 seconds and then all of a sudden magically growing three times your size. Is intriguing a lot of people and that's why they ask these questions because they're like that would be a hell of a lot easier than going to the gym and training hard. But I'm always fascinated by some of the stuff that that you talked about fact we started talk about some of the stuff in terms of cooling and what it can do performance and that was you know like. There's a month tap territory there that I think you're you're finding out about. Yeah, what we fun would be to bring the cool myth technology from Stanford this is Craig Heller my colleague Craig Heller's lab at Stanford's done really important and amazing work in this area but then it moved on to some other things. He's also working on Down syndrome and he works on a number of other really important topics that scientists often do but I have access to this cool myth technology no relationship to the company by the way we'd love to come out to your facility and and we can do the. Blind type studies blue blocker. Yeah exactly exactly and and see how that goes in with somebody advanced as advanced trained as you that's probably the best thing to do so content for the future. Yeah, I think he didn't call their are kind of staples in the PT world and I does seem like people use them slightly differently but they are they are kind of the macro nutrients of recovery there along along a sleep. I. What I do have a question about precision of record keeping do you keep a training journal. Do you recommend people keep training journals are you neurotically fixed to you know cadence of movement and are you looking at the do you have a buzzer going off for night when it's 90 seconds. It's 90 seconds rest is at 90 seconds rest I confess I have my slow workouts and my faster workouts and they scale with whether I'm training heavier with longer rest or whether or not. Maybe midway through workout I'll shift over to doing higher repetition lower rest this is kind of my you know crude way of keeping time but I'm not you know will be just to kind of watch the clock but I'm not neurotically fixed to the buzzer. No more of my on social media during my workout so which is actually a way to really improve workouts is to just not be on social media. I can't claim them not guilty of that sometimes I am on social media but sometimes I'm trying to post something well that's different. It's a good question. But I mean I I'm not necessarily. alright me this случ head Bye this wasn't this a long time not only so I in the arms I'm being rejected It's a passion a mind is a true zone so i the I'm ok you'll each in fairly much in a new part of life but in general too that's retired if you have your children to have birthday would appreciate without joining professional Call and thank you so you my family be safe and spectating with a friend who comes from the residency. But I recognize the value it has to a lot of people. It goes back to the whole my muscle connection idea that we talked about in the beginning. Like there's a lack of awareness for all aspects of training, especially maybe isn't like you're interest level. And we're talking to you and I from a position of interest. Like this is what we do. We enjoy just how our bodies work and understanding how they work. Some people don't care. They just want the end result. But journaling and keeping track of that raises awareness to where like, oh my god, I happen on Instagram for the last seven minutes. And I was supposed to be back at my next set in 90 seconds. Like there is a training effect of that. You know, if you're training for metabolic overload, you've blown that opportunity because you have it, you know, your rest time was very, was very important to that protocol working as it should. If you're training for strength, maybe the extra few minutes doesn't matter so much when you get back on the bar, you might find, I mean, you might find that it's a better response for your body to rest even longer than you've been told three, four minutes, five minutes. And so that way may be it helps. But I think that anything you can do to increase your awareness of your performance and also give yourself some objective goal. Whenever we have an objective goal, it's a lot easier to actually obtain it. When you're just there to get a pump and you're just there to lift how you feel that day, you have to be incredibly disciplined in all other aspects of your workout in order to make that effective. And I've done that too. I've actually been able to do that too, but again, the level of repetitions I've accumulated over the course of my life and the amount that I read about this stuff. And I think I'm able to get away with that. But I think more often than not, what I'm doing is not journaling, but journaling in my head, exactly what I think people should be doing and that is getting a specific effect from what you're trying to do. It's not so haphazard. You want to get a specific effect. Just like any other experiment that you're doing. You're doing an experiment on your own body with your own ways, which to me is one of the most empowering things someone can ever do. When they get bitten by the bug for exercising and training, and I like to use word training either rather than exercise because it's a purpose behind it. But when they get bitten by that training bug and they start to see actual changes in results, you know, empowering that is, because we can't really control that many things in our life, unfortunately. And so there's some things that happen to us that we really wish never happen. And those are not something that we can do anything about. But this is one thing that we can do are best to avoid disease entirely. We can't predict when we're gonna die. We can't, you know, do those things, but we can certainly decide to show up into the gym that day and get a workout in or go for a run or do something. And by doing that, you're giving yourself, I think a better chance of a higher quality of life. So any of you can do to increase your awareness of it and keep you on track with that is like I'm endorsing fully. Couldn't agree more. I couldn't agree more. The, there's a topic, it's sort of a dreaded topic, but I think it's an important one and that's the topic of nutrition. And rather, again, to specific meal programs, which would take hours and probably wouldn't even manage to scratch the surface even with hours. We could talk about principles around nutrition. What are sort of the themes that you think people should keep in mind and when thinking about how to eat generally? And pre-training and post-training are two particularly sensitive times for most, or times that people want to know a lot about, you know, what should they be for training or can they train fastage, what should they eat afterwards? But just in general, what do you think are some axioms of nutrition that really hold? And I ask this, because not because there's a lot of debate about this, but because you've been around this space a long time. And you've seen what works for you, obviously, but for other people too. You know, what tends to work, what tends not to work. And how should we think about nutrition? I mean, look, you've touched on it a bit, but like, you know, nutrition can be a touchy subject for people. And I understand where that comes from. I've talked about before. There's a dogmatic tendency to nutrition. And there's a reason for it, because it's an area that people struggle with. More than anything else. And the reason why people struggle with nutrition is because the commitment is extremely high. You could start a workout program and actually get to the gym three to five times a week. That's five hours based on how you and I were discussing it before. Well, what about the other 23 hours of each of those days? There's opportunity to eat incorrectly or unhealthily every one of those hours. People wake up in the middle of the night to go eat. You know, like there are things that you can do that can cause amazing amounts of damage to your longevity in the 23 hours, not the one hour, the 23 hours. So when people finally figure out a way to make that work for them, it's very passionate. And I understand their passion. I do, like I put out, so my approach, my approach is like, I've always been sort of a low sugar, lower fat guy. I've made the mistake of going no fat years ago and I paid for it. I was like in college. And back in the day, we were the same age. We read all the magazines in the hour. That was what we had, we haven't been there in that then. So we were reading magazines and the recommended path was to go no fat. It helps you to become hypercolored very easily because the density of the calories, and a gram of fat versus a gram of carbohydrates are protein is nine versus four for the carbs and protein. So if you're cutting out grams of fat on a daily basis, you're quickly cutting out calories that allows you to get leaner. Well, of course, as everything, I mean, a little is good and a lot is better. So I would cut all of them out or almost all of them. And at the age of 22, 21, I'm like standing at a stop at a bit university Connecticut waiting for the tram to come and bring me to campus. And I couldn't even open my eyes because the light was blinding to me. It was normal sunlight. It was blinding to me. The photos sensitivity I had, learning later on after a few more courses that I took there in biology, how necessary fat was for the development of healthy cells. I realized what was going on. Then nothing else. Other stuff, skin was bad, hair was falling out, all kinds of stuff. So I think that the approach to decreasing fat so it's not excessive because again, I'm not colorately, denser could be in having lower sugar. I don't, I'm a firm believer in sugar is really pretty toxic and something that we would all do better getting rid of a lot of it. That is the best approach for, I believe. Again, in my opinion, personally for the overall big picture because though the people can take exclusionary approaches to nutrition and taking carbs out or eating only fat proteins or again, I'm not saying it doesn't work for you. And if it's the first thing that actually allowed you to gain control of your nutrition to the point where you actually saw results and got to a healthier way, then I always say then do it, then do it, but just make sure something you can do forever and doesn't bring up on other repercussions. But I think that non-exclusionary approaches to diets are the most sustainable for the rest of your life. And when I, and all I'm interested in from a nutrition standpoint is something that's sustainable. So when I preach what I preach, I've been doing this since I was 15, 14. People say like, how's he get so ribbed? How's he get? I have been doing this for four, since it's for how many years? 30 years? 30 in low sugar? Yeah, 30 years. And in the beginning it was a slow shift I had to make where I was like, I went from the worst diet in the whole world. I was even when I was 14 years old, my breakfast was, I talked about this in my times, but like, and amends, I would eat anamends, you know, donuts in those long road. Yeah, the lost posture. Yeah. And even took the whole out of the donut. Yeah. It's probably the crete. Exactly. Why would you delete the middle of the donut? There's the crumb, the crumb donut there. I would eat donuts. I can taste it in my, I don't like sugar very much, but over the years I've lost my appetite for sugar. Right. But as you talk about the end of the donuts, I can literally smell and taste the frosting. And to me now it's disgusting, but back then it might have been appetizing. Probably have like really good information on this, but like my ability to actually remember, I know, and they've said smell is very evoking of memories. So there's a smell is unlike the other senses, because there's a direct line literally from our sense of smell to the memory centers of the brain. It doesn't have to go through any intermediate station. Okay. So my ability to actually recall exact taste of all the stuff that used to love is enough to satisfy me, to not engage in those things now. It's crazy that is. I almost get my fill to remembering because of these strong senses of memory of what it was like as odd, I used to taste so good. Okay, that's good, I had it. Fantastic. That's, well, that's, we know the neuromodulator there. That's dopamine. Yeah. The dopamine release from the thought of something, most people when they get that dopamine release, it causes a triggering of the desire for more. Right. People think of dopamine as pleasure. They're dopamine that there's a great quote called the molecule of more. I didn't write the book unfortunately, but someone else did. And it's a great book and it's really about how dopamine we think it's about pleasure, but it establishes great. So you're able to satisfy that and it's a very adaptive thing for you because you are indeed very lean. Yeah. And that's one of your kind of hallmark things and as a professional who does this in the public space, that's important when people are out there talking about getting lean and you look at them and you're like, you know, maybe you need to do the protocols. It's a huge advantage, but yeah, I think that it sounds like you've cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. Yes, yeah. I mean, but not avoiding certain things that I think are easily avoided if you realize that, I think that we have enough science and literature out there to prove that the altered path is a better path. You know, I feel like if I was just doing it because I wanted to be lean, I'm not quite sure it would have held for so long. Well, and we have a guest that who's episode has been recorded for this podcast who runs an eating disorder clinic at the University of Pennsylvania, medical school studies, binge eating disorders, and Erexia, OCD, and he will go on record, and obesity, and he will go on record saying that these very highly palatable processed, high sugar foods of the sort that we're talking about. Donuts and so forth, that they are actually dangerous, right? That there are elements of the way that they engage neural circuitry, he's a neurosurgeon, that reshape the brain in dangerous ways. And those are his words. And we have tech elements. Yeah, it's not just elements. I mean, I think not just elements, right? Yeah, they're coming out with what? With donuts. Yeah, they can't catch us. Right? Sure. Right. In any case, so in terms of what you do eat, how do you structure that in terms of, when you look down at a plate, you've done these, and you've described this before, but I think it's just a beautifully simple description, because I think a lot of people don't want to do calorie counting in all this. And how should people think about what to eat? So yeah, I have what I call plate method. And it's just simple because it works for me. And again, if you're struggling with real eating issues, these mechanisms become immediately less effective because you're having maybe a emotionally triggered eating. And you can't stop at one plate. I mean, you can get the plate right, but if the portions are out of control plate, right, plate has the dimensionality of the time. I can't do it. More multiple plates, you know, like second and third plate, right, right, right, right. Like then, all these things can be challenged, but what I would I say is, when you have your plate, then you just simply look at it as like a clock, right? And if you just make a 920 on the clock, so one arm goes over to the 9 and one of the arms goes over to 20, well then you're basically, you're gonna take the second largest portion of that because you're gonna get to make the line towards 12 o'clock too. And the largest portion is gonna be your Fiber's carbohydrate. So that's the green vegetables, right? So whether it be broccoli or Brussels sprouts, or Sparious or, you know, pick your favorites, you know, like those are the ones that give us a lot of the micro nutrients we need, they're the ones that are generally, you know, except that it's more healthy. And they're also gonna provide the fiber that's gonna be both beneficial in terms of its impact on insulin and also just through filling you up, right? And then I take the next largest portion of that and I devote that towards protein. And I think it's really important, especially for anybody active, the more active you are, the more you embark on trying to build muscle, you're gonna need to have protein and every meal so I have that. And again, you know, we're talking cleaner sources of protein, but like I am, you'll never find like boiled chicken on my plate. Like I ditch those days when I was 16 or 15 or 16. Like I realized after reading those bodybuilding magazines that maybe the low fat things stuck for too long, but the, or the no fat things stuck for too long, but the boiled chicken and, you know, a steam broccoli thing that ended quickly for me, because I really am not gonna eat this forever. So I'll have some sort of fish or chicken but it will be, it will be cooked in a way that's like, you know, it's got maybe some sauce on it or it's got some, maybe it's tomato sauce. Anything to just make it a little bit more palatable and interesting without blowing the value of the meal. And then that last portion is where I put my starts your carbohydrates. And again, that's the part that some people say exclude them entirely because they're not healthier. They don't work for you or they're not, you know, but official long term. For me, it's been a God said. And I do think I'm like most people, my body craves those carbohydrates. I choose things like sweet potatoes, which is my favorite, you know, or I'll have rice or I'll have pasta, I'm Italian, so I'm like pasta. And I like, I will have those things. I'm not excluding them, but I don't put them in the portions that you would generally find. You know, my wife and I will go out and we'll go to restaurant sometimes because we travel quite a bit or use to at least with baseball too. There's a cheesecake factor ever really went. And I love cheesecake factor. But like the way they structure meals is, it's all rice on the bottom and a little bit chicken on top. And I mean, it's a plate full of rice. That you wouldn't find me make a plate that way. I'm gonna just devote that portion of the plate to the Star Trek carbohydrates. And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility in terms of portion control. Because those are the foods, again, probably, you know, dopamine driven that are most easily over-eaten. I always ask the question, what's the last time you ate 10 chicken breasts at a meal? Like you're getting sick of it after maybe two or three. But you could eat a whole hell of a lot of carbohydrates, Star Trek carbohydrates because they're just so satisfying. And I think those triggers, as you said, the want more, like that's what happens, right? You just keep even when you're feeling full, you want more. And that's the biggest danger to carbohydrates. So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them, then you can still enjoy them. If you can't develop that discipline for whatever reason, then maybe they do become something that you have to work yourself around or adopt a different eating style. And as I said, I'm never to the point where I'm not trying to be dogmatic in my approach. I'm always trying to say, this is how I do it. And I'm a believer in it, just like everyone else is believer in their method. But I'm open to the idea that something that works for you and gets you to a healthier weight and a sustainability. Like that is good. That's good for me. Provided doesn't introduce other issues. Something one can do consistently. That's something I picked up from you over the years. What can you do consistently? And for me, that also meant when and how can I eat? What can I eat consistently? That will also allow me to be alert after lunch. So I can actually get some work done. Or eat. I like to train faster to the morning, but I don't do any long-term fasting. It just so happens that I'm fine doing water and caffeine in the morning and training in the morning and then I eat my first meal afterwards. But I get carbohydrates at night. So my glycogen is stored. I think carbohydrates are wonderful. I just don't eat them in excess. So to me, I feel like when what you describe is a very rational, literally balanced approach. And obviously there will be variations for people who are dealing with obesity or diabetes. Or I've got friends that are on the pure carnivore thing. I have friends that are vegan. And it's always impressive to me when somebody can stick to anything consistently. Except when they're sticking to just poor behavior. Or that's something impressive about that. So I think that's very helpful because I think there's a, for the typical listener of this podcast, the online content that people see, the battles are very confusing. They're distracting. Because people really think, oh, there's a right way in a wrong way. And it sounds like the way that one can eat consistently over time that's healthy. Certainly fewer processed in sugary foods. I think almost every day. Everybody over there. Yeah, almost everyone agrees on that, right? So I think it is a, it's a calorie manipulation through some other method. So even, even, intermittent fasting, like you said, that could be, it's for people that are grazers. Like if you are a grazer and your real problem is portion control over the course of the day, but you can respond to a rule that says no, you're eating between here and here. You can obey that rule. Well, you're not gonna be able to graze during the times that you might be doing additional damage. So sure, there's other hormonal benefits that people will talk about from that approach, but from a longevity standpoint and habit forming standpoint. If it's fixing the habit that you're breaking too often by eating throughout, whenever you feel like you walk by a food, it's good, you know, and it works. And again, it's, it's, you know, people can, we'll tell you you can probably eat whatever you want to eat as long as you're eating within those. That window, but I think the more responsible people who are practitioners of that will say, no, you still want a void process sugar and things like that. So, and that's just a mechanism of eating that really a diet, but like it's, I think that people, I hate to be as basic as it sounds with that, but it's for the exact reason that if it's that 23 hour day phenomenon that's like, you know, you said you're impressed, it is impressive. It's so hard to control all of our behaviors and food being one of the hardest thing. I don't want the biggest temptations for people. You know, learn how to control that for so long and then do it day after day after day. Whatever that mechanism is that works for you, is impressive, you know, and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a believer in it, you know, I think that's the, that's how I feel. I just feel like people need to be able to be given some rains to be able to, to find what works for them. Well, I love to eat and one of the beauties of weight training is I feel like I can eat plenty for my age and I'm not as lean as you are, but I'm happy with where I'm at. It could always do better. You know, with each year, actually, I'm getting better, probably because I'm eating cleaner, because I also have someone to cook for me now. And we like, and we like healthy food and so we're very fortunate. I don't think we have any packaged food in our home. We can start making sour crowd at home. I don't make it. Yeah, she makes it. Well, my wife actually, you know, she, she, she, turned me on to a tip that I actually shared with the whole channel, which was like, you can go to, we have a student Leonard's around our big, for grocery store chain around us, and they have a catering department. And, you know, they're often used for catering big parties and, you know, big tubs of, of a girl chicken, but like really good grilled chicken. Again, not the boiled chicken, but it are big tubs of super tentos. And we'll, you know, we'll get a bunch of those and show go over and show get them, then she'll sort of arrange, you know, them on plates and put the plates in and like, I'm okay with repetitive eating. I think more people are probably okay with repetitive eating than they think. I think that when you actually break down how many different breakfast varieties, like variations do you have three, two, two or two, and I have some of them. So like, I think when people do this more variety for dinner, probably, but like, even there you're probably five different types of dinners, you know, over the course of, you know, a week or a month. Well, you know, if you have that ability to identify the things that you like, and again, no plan is gonna work if you're eating stuff you don't like. It's not gonna work forever. Nothing will. You have to really enjoy what you're eating. As long as these variations of this meal are something you really enjoy, and there are limited versions of them, the reproducibility of that is simple. You know, it will take some time, but if you're fortunate enough in our case to have somebody who can prepare for you, now that's even part out of the equation, you know? And it's like, it just makes it very simple. But I do think, when you tally up all the costs of medical care that are spiked by having poor nutrition and you then offset that by what it might cost you to invest in a faster strategy, like this catering trick or whatever it might be, you'd be best off figuring out a way that maybe reallocate some of your money to preparing this because you know how important it is to your long-term health and longevity. If you can figure out your nutrition issues of everyone listening to this podcast can figure out their nutrition issues, this whole world will be different. That is like, we want what the largest sources of disease and pain and discomfort because people really struggle in nutrition. Yeah, and it's a huge problem. I mean, the OVC, it is an epidemic in this country. It's a very, very serious. Also, a lot of highly processed foods are more expensive than health here, too. When you really break it down, even the better source of high quality foods are right there on par less than the processed foods for sure. I've got a couple other questions as it relates to training because I think that one thing that a lot of people wonder about, I mean, we could do this in kind of a true false method, just to get through some of these. I feel like I'm gonna write it, please. Exactly. Men and women should train differently. The science of it will say false. The, and again, not to generalize, but kind of the point you touched on earlier today, I do find that casually interested women in training will migrate more towards certain types of fitness, like kickboxing, like dancing, like low rest circuit type. Yeah, yeah. And I think, again, whatever is that you're going to engage in regularly is what you should do. Physiologically, no. And I think if we can get more women to feel more comfortable in the gym, performing the same exercises in the same, in receiving the same training benefits and working on progressive overload. And like, yeah, we've hit the Holy Grail. But I think that it's a big bridge that has to be gapped still because, you know, there's just some reality to listen, there are very, my wife is a perfect example that's living a very complicated busy life. We have two young boys, their twins. And her attention and focus is there, you know? And it's like, she doesn't do this for a living like I do. And if she can get a decent workout and she's happy, you know? But she's not necessarily working on her deadlift PR, you know? And so I think that that would help her and serve her in the long term to work on increasing her PRs and different lifts and building her strength progressively. But in her life right now, it's not necessarily in the cards to have the time to focus on that. So would you then discourage this other thing that she might find interesting? Like some boxing, you know? There was a little, I don't remember the brand, but like one of those punchable boxing stand-up things. You know, she enjoys it, you know? And you know, like anything to get to get you moving is going to be preferable, but I don't think that necessarily physiologically there's a, there's a difference. You start weight training pretty young. Yeah. But yeah, I messed around with my brother because he was older years, four years older. So I was kind of messing around with ways, probably 12 or 13 with the five pound dumbbell. Okay. Yeah, you hear that young kids shouldn't work out with the weights. I don't know what the going standard is. And now they say, you know, shuts down long bone growth plates, you know, this sort of thing. You've got two young boys, adorable kids, by the way. Yeah. I wanted that one of the things that is very heartwarming is to see you're in a great shape, you're extremely bright. You know, you're craft, you love your craft. You work with Jesse who we'll talk about as well. It's great, you know, which is great. You know, that there's a camaraderie there and having great teammates as part of a business or to work out with us, just makes life better. Let's just be honest. I'm grateful to have great teammates for the podcast and my lab, of course, as well. But to see your boys and your dogs and the whole picture, you know, it's a, you know, I'm sure it has a lot of contours and complexity that we don't know about and shouldn't know about, but it's a beautiful picture. And will they wait, Train? I've seen the videos of one or both of them hanging from the boys. These kids have naturalism telling you that. I wonder where they get it from. I don't even, you know, I don't even encourage it. I'm not going to be the dad who's sitting there and say, let's go, some more. All right, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we got our two days here. I'm not going to not going to do that, but they have a natural interest in the gym. They just sometimes like to be out with daddy. So they'll come out there. And, you know, I, I of the two of us, my wife and I will be the one who has a little bit more of a longer least to let them explore things, because I was a dummy at times too and figured out best through the mistakes. The range. We said, in neuroscience, we call that one trial learning. There you go. These guys are going to be masters of one trial learning, because, you know, they'll go grab, you know, the bars of my, the handles of my jammer. They're just there, because at a lower level to them. And they're swinging around, they're doing pull-ups on it, naturally, unccoach nothing from me. One will walk out to a deadlift bar, stand over, and naturally never sell me, do it, stands over there and this goes, er, you know, tries to pull it. So there's a, there's a definitely an inclination to liking the gym. And I will fully support that, but of course, you know, body weight will be good for quite a while. So what age do you think is reasonable for kids to start exploring a non-body weight? Like, figure out 13. You know, I think around 13, once pure body, I think it's okay to start to, you know, because there's so much, I even say for people that are like, later an age, who are just starting out, learn with your own body weight first. There's plenty of resistance to be had by learning how to command your body in space. So if you have never trained before, you're going to get very stimulated by doing lunging and reverse lunging, even learning some of the proprioception around movement through space. Pull-ups, chinups, pull-ups of channels of challenging for even people that have had 20, 30 years of experience in the gym. So there's a lot of stimulus to be had by body weight and jumping straight to dumbbells or barbells is actually doing yourself with the service. You can learn better, command of your body in space. So when you go back to the bigger lives, you're going to have an easier time sort of progressively loading them and building up that foundation of strength. I'm not saying that you have to become a master calisthenics athlete before you can touch a barbell. That's not even true. I'm just saying there's so much capacity. Kids are going to be doing this anyway. And really, if you look at general play, they are jumping, they are lunging, they are climbing, they are pulling, that's what they do. So why I don't know where the avoidance of structured training is for younger kids. Again, provide other using body weight, maybe less ballistic movements or something like that. Things that are certainly overloaded movements, I think we should encourage kids to do more. There's a lot of obesity and kids on the rise also. And that is incredibly disconserting to me. So I think, and I hope it doesn't come from the advice of some that say, well, wait until you're older to start doing something. Like, that's a way worse tradeoff than engaging in something smart now. We used to get kicked out of the house when we were kids. Totally. My mom would kick us out. I don't know. I had a huge pack of boys that lived on my street. But we get kicked outside. Literally, you're not allowed in the hotel. There were video games, of course, but we were kicked out of the house. We had to go play. Professor of skateboarding soccer, and then we'd find our trouble. But so post-training nutrition. We're the same age. Years ago, I was sort of neurotic about the idea that I had to ingest a certain amount of carbohydrates and proteins within two hours, then it was 90 minutes of training. I confess I get, if I train hard, so I'm talking about the resistance training, not the running. But the resistance training, 60 to 90 minutes later, I'm really hungry. But there have been days when I just skip and then the hunger passes, and then later, I eat more. I might twice as much later. That's just the way sometimes schedules go. But what do your thoughts in terms of the nutrition science, the training related effects of the post-training meal? Is it something that you try to get? Is it something that you think people should pay attention to? So that science is actually probably been the one that's changed the most in my lifetime, honestly, because I, again, were the same age, and I was falling for the same trap, where I would really be focused on, like, I'm risking speeding tickets driving home from the gym to a big rear-guarget in a ball of window. I did all that. I really did. But thankfully, that's been sort of de-punked in your body. It isn't just rushing through these certain periods of time to utilize the nutrients in our body, but are able to partition them and use them over a much greater duration. Up to now they're saying, three to four hours after training, five hours after training, you can still see the benefits of replenishment. A lot of that is just, I think there's a consistency element to it that just utilizing a post-workout window or a post-workout meal, even if it's within two hours or one hour, is just ingrained in the habit of saying, listen, I just did this activity and now I wanna replenish some of what I lost, the energy that I used to perform, the exercises that I did. And just getting into the routine, knowing that, the engine is ultimately fed by what we put in it. And the concept of replenishing the fuel lost, it's still a concept that I think, again, different and mechanism, but still important in terms of fueling you overall performance. So the pre-workout period of time gives us a chance to actually have a longer window because if those nutrients are obtained pre-workout, it's not like they're gone in that hour that you've trained. They're still there and available for your body. So I think it's important to get one of the two, right or at least make sure you're consistently having one or the two or you might risk going through all these periods of having no nutrition to support your efforts, not only where your work has potentially suffer in terms of the output, but then you're also not providing your body and ability to capitalize on an opportunity to feed it and refuel and recover. So I'm not very dogmatic about what specifically to eat or post work out, but I do think you should have protein surrounding your training, whether that be a head of time or after. Protein could be a little bit hard to digest for some people. So if you do that pre-workout and then you're finding your work out is slogging because you don't feel good, then so only you put that after your meal. But this whole concept of the urgency of time has thankfully been removed. And we can just learn to eat a little bit more, you know, responsibly and drive more responsibly. So we're not, you know, trying to rush home from the gym and risk killing people in the way. You know, I think it's, but I think it's great because I think that that was something that it just showcases a belief that people had for so long that has since been proven to be not that important. And there's a tip of the cap towards research in a good way where it's like, all right, I think we could all agree that this isn't necessarily true anymore. And look at yourself and say, oh my God, I did that so often. I bet that one hook line and sinker. But then realize, okay, but we can always make a change in the good thing about nutrition is those changes can happen the very next time you go to eat. And you'll start to see the benefits of that. So I'm not a big believer in that strict approach to pre or post workout. I mean, even as far as pre workout supplements, a lot of people don't take them, a lot of people don't like them. They don't take them. They're not necessarily even being used as the new, new, new, true, the side of the pre workout. They're just more used to fuel the workout. For me, it's a water and some form of caffeine. Yeah, I mean, it's whatever, you know, again, I think it's important. I do think it's important to maintain a high level of output. So if your pre workout nutrition requires a stimulant in order to help you do that, or if your pre workout nutrition is causing you to have a harder time the train because you're feeling full or stomachache or something else, then that's not achieving what you're trying to do. The ultimate goal is to still be able to perform at the highest level. So whatever your nutrition is required until allow you to still do that, that is probably the most important factor of all of it. Great. I love the very clear and rational approach. Don't ingest anything right before your workout or your workout, that's going to make your workout worse. So even if you're so simple and yet you don't hear this because I think people will think, oh, they must have a pre workout. They must have a post workout. Again, like even if the benefits that are to be had from whatever's being suggested, it's going to be easily offset by the fact that you can't perform at an output capable of driving any change. So that would pretty much negate the fact that there's no out weighing those benefits of whatever nature to approach you took and it's struggling through your workout. For me, the best pre workout is a good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. Yeah. There you go. I miss it. It works. And then, post where I do find I get quite hungry and want to eat quite a bit more. And lots of natural response, the body is going into most people want to do that. And I think it should be fed. I worked out, again, a lot of my postings on Instagram will happen at 10 o'clock in night, 10 30 at night, 11 at night because I am actually training there. And that's where I'm taking those little breaks in between sets to actually film or post something. But I then go inside a dinner. So I'm eating at 11 o'clock at night. It's not necessarily ideal. I'm not recommending that as a tool for anybody. I think it dispels one thing. I've never been a believer in kidney carbs after six. Yeah, that makes no sense to me. Zero. Based on all the science of metabolism that I've seen. Right. I think as long as you can sort of like napping, I talk to Matt Walker, one of the great sleep researchers, where why we sleep, et cetera, and as his own podcast about sleep, tremendous researcher, public communicator about sleep. And he said, nafs are fine for vitate. They don't interrupt your ability to sleep well at night. Simple. Tell me when sleep from 8 to 9 p.m. and then go to bed at midnight and not a problem. Other people, they take a 30 minute nap after lunch and they can't sleep at night. Same thing with caffeine's a little different because Matt would argue the architecture of sleep can be disrupted, et cetera. But if you can eat dinner late, eat carbohydrates late, I actually need carbohydrates at night in order to be able to sleep. Whenever I've done a low carbohydrate type regimen in the evening, I have a hard time following a sleep. I'm just too alert. And so I eat carbohydrates in the evening to restore glycogen, but also in order to make sure that I can fall asleep. I actually can, again, obviously it's already late at night by the time I'm done eating, but I can fall asleep within five, 10 minutes of finishing my meal. Because I do think that they have that same effect on me. But I'm not bothered by the feeling of fullness, I'm not unable to sleep because I'm feeling a fullness. But I do like the fact that I feel as if I'm at least replenishing what was lost through my hard training. And I do like to back it up with a dinner. I don't need to eat smaller amounts. Some people can't have that much. I will say after a hard leg workout, I don't have the same appetite that I do after let's say, you know, an upper body workout. It can really disrupt my whole feeling of well-being. You want to eat less after you train your legs? I do. I'm the opposite. No, because I just feel like I can feel sick of my stomach. You're clearly training harder. I've seen the way you train. You do train very intensely. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's important. Again, it's that trade-off between if you're not going to train for a long period of time, then you're going to want to train harder. And again, I actually feel like contrary to what people might think as you age, you're better off training harder for shorter period of time. It's always within the realm of safe training. I mean, I think that's what I like to think this. I bring to the table, like an approach that's smarter. So I can train harder. Like not doing the dumb things I did when I was a kid. And with that trade-off being a harder trainer, I think I get the results that I want because I'm able to really push it and then back off. And again, the meal feels like I almost a physiological reward for the hard effort I put in the gym. Knowing that I'm also replenishing and setting the stage for the next day to be another successful day of training, or maybe not. You know, depending on the time of the day, we could train. But yeah, I think that it's a lot less, it's a lot, I hate to say, but it's a lot less scientific than we want to make it. And as it seems to be coming back off in times like the thing that works for you is really the most important thing because ultimately getting your ass and there and doing what you do is really the thing that provides the best benefit. Absolutely. And there are many things that I would say, a hallmarks of Jeff Cavalier, but one of them is certainly consistency. You make it happen when you're in other. Huge. Consistency really is the determinant. And I know that that is the hardest part for people that are and why people tend to look for the shortcut because consistency is the part that becomes the biggest challenge. But if you could find, listen, if you could find the, I'm going to, you know, through what I've been trying to encourage here is like, if you could find the nutrition approach, if you could find the training approach, if you could try to find the training split, if you could try all those things that encourage you to want to go to the gym. Like you're locked in at the point where you said you actually look forward to going and doing your work. I love it. I look forward to, I mean, it's, you know, actually this morning, I went to one of our teammates for the podcast. I got workout and halfway through, I just turned him and I said, I'll never figure out why that feels so good, but it feels so good. I just, I really enjoy it. And it lets, and I love to eat and it lets me eat. And I love the way it makes you feel afterwards. I don't understand this concept of not enjoying the gym. Cardio is a little different. I always love the first 10 or 20 minutes of jog. I mildly love the middle third and by the end, I think this is the greatest thing ever, why don't you do it all the time. And then that feeling evaporates before the next time I do it. Yeah, of course, I don't even remember either. And again, exactly. Yeah, I, I, I, I think if people could, if, if we had one gift, we could give to everybody, it would be the love of fitness. Right? We'd be stowed to love a fitness. It would change the entire world, you know? But I think when you hear things like this that like, hey, that will work and that will work too and that this will work too, you know, rather than the dogmatic one-way only approach, which could be to come to discouraging for people. Then I think it becomes a little bit uplifting like, well, I've never tried that. I've actually never tried a total body split or I've never tried, you know, that style of eating. It becomes encouraging that you might want to explore and then you might finally get locked in and say I really liked this and then you're often running. Let's, what I so enjoy about your content. I, we would be remiss if we didn't just briefly discuss Jesse. One of the great pleasures for me in in watching your content and learning from it over the years is that you took on a, you decided to mentor somebody, right? Jesse and there's a, there's some poking fun back and forth between the two of you, which is very amusing, but I have to say it inspired me to do something early on in developing this podcast as I have a young intern who has helped me with some of the research and he's a budding, he's interested in science, he's about to go off to college, but he also got really into fitness. We watched the videos of you guys. He was helping me get the Instagram content early on. And one thing that was just, it was, it's such a pleasure to be able to pass a long knowledge and, and of course, I'm learning from him. This is always the way it works. We learn from teaching and we learn from students. But it's been great to see Jesse's progress. It's amazing. I've got the meat and in person just now and he's, he has grown. He's changed physically. And I think that you mentioned a love of fitness. I think that in one of the best ways to be consistent is to take on the responsibility of teaching others. Once one has proficiency and something. So maybe you just tell us a little bit about how that's going. How is Jesse doing? And where, where does he need a little more work? Where is he thriving? I'm impressed by the progress. Well, we have a, we physically, we can obviously see the, the changes, you know, the list of things to work on or is, is immense. It's so long for him to continue to improve. But now actually, you know, in reality, Jesse, the story of Jesse was that I knew Jesse prior to starting even athlete X. And the matter of fact, I think the funny thing is the very first video that was ever posted on my channel was a video that he shot as, I don't know, a 13 year old or something. And I said, can you just film this for a second? I was over there, you know, training members of the family. So he went off with the college, went into film, realized he had much greener pastures at athlete X. Instead of becoming the next discoursesier, something, and he decided to come work with me. And, you know, the expectations in the beginning were just to edit videos or just to, you know, help with various aspects of like my day to day that I don't think I was, you know, equipped to really handle and grow the business anymore. So then, you know, look at by virtue of being in that environment, there's an interest. I think if I worked in a gym, I might become interested in working out. And though that mine was not a commercial gym, it's sitting right behind my office, you know, window. There became an interest in wanting to work out a little bit. And it wasn't even an intentional experiment, you know, to put Jesse there. I just thought that he's a very likable person. He has a very funny personality. He's also the every man. You know, in some ways, you know, as I'm sure maybe you experience sometimes, like, I'm the guy that this comes naturally for me is what people will say. Like, this is what you do for a living. Like, this is what you, like, there's an element of disconnect in terms of the related ability because I do do this for a living. I can't deny that. I do work with professional athletes. So like, there's a level of interest in this above and beyond. But for him, he's just the kid who wants to train maybe if he rolls out of bed before 11 a.m. and, you know, doesn't have a date on Friday night. But that's the guy everybody can relate to and watching him transform. And I love the fact that even the interest level, you know, was up and down. Like, it wasn't a consistent for him because he was like, you know, part interested in them, maybe not as three months. And then interested in that. And I never pushed it on. I'm like, this is, again, this was no orchestrated experiment for me. It was just like, if you want to do this, then do this. And also from a standpoint of like lending my help or expertise to him, like I said with my son, I'm not going to force it on anybody. I don't want to do that to anybody. I don't think that that's ever going to spark that desire for long term, you know, adoption. So he got more interested. He started to learn more about it. He watched his videos that were filming. He films the videos that were filming. And he's learning through what I'm saying is becoming more of a student of the field. And I have to say his knowledge in the field has grown with the growth of his physique. And he's put into practice some of the things that I say. He's put in practice some things. He hears other places. And he winds up, you know, improving as he goes. And he winds up starting to love this, like he, you know, never thought he would. But it's great to see anybody grow. And whether that be physically or that be emotionally or that be, you know, just in their career, it's great to see somebody grow. And I, I liked to tease him. Funny, admission here. There are times when the jab is that I will throw at him or something that we might know ahead of time of what I'm going to say to him. People will say, you're so mean to him. I can't believe it. You know, that's so abusive. You know, like, dude, honestly, we laugh after it's over. It's good. We're good. You know, so, you know, of course, but like, but there's tougher than he looks as what you're saying. But anyway, it looks really tough now. He's got the big beard. He's like, he looks more manly than I do. I can't grow a beard. I don't, yeah, I mean, believe me. He's, he's totally alpha and I'm like, you know, quickly becoming, you know, the second, the second star of this show. But like, you know, he's definitely contributed and people enjoy his presence for sure. Yeah, I certainly do. And I think that you, as you pointed out, he's a kind of a proxy and a template for for everybody. We can relate to him because even though I've trained for many years, you know, it's been a struggle. You know, through graduate school post, you know, it made it happen one way or another. But with more or less attention and admittedly through, you know, waxing, waning levels of motivation, although, you know, unfortunately that I do enjoy it. What I think is nice about it, too, is that it's, it's a realistic expectation that we said, I think, you know, there was your, your showcasing what the journey actually looks like. And he's been on the journey for, again, you know, devotedly for, let's say, the last year and a half, but on the journey for five years. If I could make the gains that he did, starting when I started training at, you know, 14 15 and you're saying, hi, by 20, you're going to have the strength levels he does, the physique that he does, the knowledge that you've gained. Like that seems like a blink of an eye now looking back, you know, at 46 years old, I'm like, holy cow, like I think it took me 20 years, you know, 15 to 20 years. So, you know, to just even start to get into a groove, for him to do it at, in a period of five years, it doesn't seem long. Whereas there's people that will criticize his journey, like, oh, it's just taking so long and selling, there's such an instant gratification, you know, that people seek, luckily, that's the minority. Most people are like, this is amazing, you know? But I think that it becomes very uplifting because not only is it relatable, but the journey is real and people can, and people can appreciate that, like, this is what will happen if you actually put in consistent artwork. And you'll watch him transform, go back and watch the videos, like you look at, we like to oftentimes throw back to videos where he appeared as, you know, smaller Jesse, but also shy Jesse, arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact with the camera, you know, to where now he's got his own skits and intros, you know, it's like it's funny because the confidence with the growth of the Zee came confidence too, which is great. So, it's pretty soon, it'll be his world and we're all living in it, as they say. Well, on behalf of myself and all the listeners, I really want to thank you, first of all for the discussion today, I learned in a men's amount. Even though I thought I knew your content well, I still learned in men's amount. Many things we could deploy from when to stretch, how to stretch the skipping rope, we talked about nutrition, we talked about it. He called training regimens, and what I love about all of this, now that you've given us is that there's a backbone of logic, you know, and some consistent themes indeed about consistency, but the logical backbone, I think is what will enable people to really show up to the table and stay there for training consistently over time. And as you said, the gift of fitness is an immense gift. I can't thank you enough. I know you're an incredibly busy human being with kids and dogs and a marriage and a much more professional. I was happy I was able to make it work because I really, I've been watching stuff for a while and I really love the science of it, I like the way you think. And it's just, you know, it was, I'm just really fortunate that I was able to do it. Well, I feel very gratified in hearing that and honored to have you here. So thank you so much. Thank you.

vid00011," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast where we discuss science, science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today my guest is Edo Portal. Edo Portal is somebody who truly defies formal definition. He is, however, credited by many, to be the world expert in all things movement. Movement is one of the more fascinating and important aspects of our nervous system. In fact, it was the great Nobel Prize winner, Sharon Tinn, that said, Movement is the final common path. And what he was referring to is the fact that so much of our nervous system is dedicated to movement. And in particular, that the human nervous system can generate the greatest variety of forms of movement. We can run, we can jump, we can crawl, we can move at different speeds. Far more variation in movement and different types and speeds of movement than any other animal in the animal kingdom can perform. My interest in bringing Edo Portal onto this podcast stem from a discussion about just that, about Sharon Tinn and the enormous range of movements that humans can engage in. Edo is both a practitioner and an intellectual. We all know what a practitioner is. It's somebody who walks the walk, who actually performs the thing that they are knowledgeable about. And indeed, Edo has studied Capuera, a number of other martial arts, dance, gymnastics, various forms of sport. He's trained top athletes like Conomor Greger, and he has many, many other credits to his name as a practitioner and teacher. However, he is also a true intellectual of movement. I define an intellectual as somebody who can both think about and talk about a subject at multiple levels of granularity. That is, with exquisite detail and with its simplicity, depending on their audience and depending on the topic at hand. And as you'll soon hear from my discussion with Edo, he is both a practitioner and a true intellectual of all things movement. Today, through our discussion, you will learn how the nervous system generates movement and the different forms of movement, the different speeds of movement. You're also going to get an incredible insight through Edo's mind and eyes of how movement can serve us in the various context of life. Not just in sport, not just in exercise, but in every aspect of our lives from the time we get up in the morning until the time we go to sleep at night, how we engage with others, how we engage with ourselves, indeed, how movement even informs relationships of different kinds. I found our discussion to be one of the most enlightening and interesting discussions that I've ever had, not just about movement, but about the nervous system. I can assure you that by the end of this episode, you will not only learn a tremendous amount about movement through the eyes and mind of the one and only Edo portal, but you also will learn a tremendous amount of neuroscience, about how the cells and circuits and hormones and neurotransmitters of your body, assist in creating the various forms of movement that you can generate, that you're trying to learn and generate, and that perhaps you should think about trying to learn and generate. And indeed, you'll learn some protocols and tools for how to do that. In science, we have a phrase, actually it's a title that's reserved for only the rarest of individuals. We say that somebody is an N of 1, meaning a sample size of 1, and as you'll soon learn, Edo portal is truly an N of 1. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one of vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012, and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. In fact, when people ask me, what's the one supplement they should take? I always say Athletic Greens because it covers all of those essential nutritional bases, and the probiotics adaptogens and digestive enzymes are vital for things like the gut microbiome. Your gut microbiome is trillions of little microbiectoria that live in your gut and that support your immune system, your endocrine system, and the so-called gut brain access, which is important for mood and neurotransmitter production, a huge number of biological systems in your brain and body. Athletic Greens also tastes great. I mixed mine with water, and I like a little bit of lemon juice or lime juice in there. As I mentioned, I drink it twice a day. Usually once in the morning, during the phase of the day, in which typically I'm fasting or around breakfast time, and then again in the afternoon or even in the evening. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to AthleticGreens.com slash Huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, and they'll give you a year supply of Vitamin D3K2. Vitamin D3 and K2 are important for endocrine health, for cardiovascular health, for calcium regulation, and so on. Again, that's AthleticGreens.com slash Huberman to claim this special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka. Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses. They're of the absolute highest quality and practicality. I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend within enormous number of challenges. For instance, when you move from a shady area to a bright area, your eyes have to adapt to that. Roka understands the various challenges that the visual system has to face, and they've developed sunglasses and eyeglasses with all of that biology in mind. Their glasses were developed by two all-American swimmers from Stanford, and initially, Roka sunglasses and eyeglasses were for athletes. They design eyeglasses that then and still now will stay on your face if you get sweaty. You can wear them running. You can wear them cycling, et cetera. They're very lightweight, so lightweight, in fact, at most of the time you don't even remember that they're on your face. But Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses also come in a terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them anywhere. So unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses out there that make people look like cyborgs, you can wear Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses. When exercising to dinner, to work, again, aesthetics are really terrific and really adaptable to all those different environments. If you'd like to try Roka glasses, you can go to Roka.

Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your sleep needs. I've talked a lot on this podcast and on another podcast and on social media about the essential need for sleep. Put simply, sleep is the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance. Just a few nights or even one night to poor sleep can really hinder your mental health, physical health and performance in all aspects of life. Helix has customized sleep products. That is mattresses and pillows that are designed to your sleep needs. And you can figure out what those sleep needs are very easily. By going to the Helix website, they have a quiz. It takes just about two minutes and ask you questions like, do you sleep on your back, your side or your stomach, do you tend to run hot or cold during sleep, etc. Or maybe you don't even know the answers to those questions. That's fine too. That's an option that you can answer as well. You take the brief two minute quiz and then Helix will match you to the ideal mattress and pillow for you. I matched to the so-called dusk mattress. I started sleeping on that well over a year ago now and it's the best sleep I've ever had. I'm sleeping much longer and much better through the entire night. And as a consequence, I'm feeling much better, more clear, more physically alert, etc. throughout the day. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to Helixleep.com-huberman. You can take that two minute quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you. And you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders and two free pillows. Again, if you're interested, you go to Helixleep.com-huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows. And now for my discussion with Edo Portal. Edo? Thank you for coming here today. I've been looking forward to sitting down with you to talk for a very long time. I was first exposed to your work. My post or a podcast I believe of had a group of people walking down handrails. Literally the handrails along stairwells and I don't want to say former skateboarder, once a skateboarder, always a skateboarder. There's a skateboarder. Handrails have a particular meaning, but I was really struck by first of all. The incredible range of skill that people had and yet they're willing this to do this. I think of handrails and walking on handrails or skateboarding and handrails as a potential hazard. And yet some of the incredible proficiency that some of the people there including yourself had. So like many people I was drawn to your practice and your work initially through a wide-eyed, wow. You know, they're doing some incredible stuff on natural objects, much of skateboarders or parkour folks do. But over the years we've been in communication and I've come to realize that you're a true intellectual of the topic of movement. And I define an intellectual as somebody who can understand a topic at multiple levels of granularity, detail, general, specific connections, et cetera. So to start off, could you share with us your conception of this idea of movement? Obviously movement involves translations through space. But when you talk about a movement practice, what are you really thinking about? What are we talking about when we talk about a movement practice? It's a big question. I somehow left the definition, the very tight definition of it out for myself because I felt it was starting to constrict me and be around me and I let the practice itself really define it. But I think part of our sense of everything is actually a sense of movement and then the stillness in the background of that. So for me, this is the entity that I refer to as movement and using that perspective for self-aballusion, development, of course, the physical side, but also movement of emotions, movement of thoughts and any other movements, and by switching these layers and examining it from different places, you get a better and better sense of it. I think the visuals nowadays and media are what defines for people in the beginning things and then little by little with experience they can dive deeper, which is good. There is some aspect, sexy aspect or not so sexy aspect and then you pull on it and you start to examine and dive deeper and then you receive the gift of it, finding out more. I heard you say once that we are not just a brain with a body but we are a body with a brain which I absolutely love because as a student and a researcher of the nervous system, I never think about the brain as its own isolated thing. I think about the nervous system and the fact that the brain and the spinal cord are connected to the body and the body is connected to the brain in every direction, it's everything truly is connected at the physical level, physiological level. Do you just share, for a moment, how you think about this body, brain relationship, in terms of you mentioned movement of emotions, movement of the body that you can't really separate the two. And for the typical person who is listening to this, they might not immediately understand what that means. Maybe it's something that has to be experienced. But when we think about the body and the brain and the whole thing working as one cohesive whole, what does that mean to you? Or put simply when you do a movement practice, what are you focusing on? Are you focusing on the movement of your limbs? I have to imagine that's true, but are you also focusing on how that makes you feel or how your feelings make you move? Okay. So some thoughts, I will try not to answer any of your questions during this interview, but I will definitely give some thoughts and then we can play with it. I think these definitions and in general the limitation of words ends up creating some kind of a corruptive process. The words corrupt us and corrupt are understanding. So I think the brain body, this Cartesian state of mind and thinking brought a lot of good, but also brought a lot of problems. And movement for me is the entity that ties everything together. It's the magic is the thoughts and animates. It's when the coin spins and you see both sides appear at the same time. It's a beautiful analogy from a friend of mine, a doctor, a rasmus, only. So the mind and body are one of those pairs and I call it the movement body mind system. When it's integrated, it's in motion. There is also a stillness that appears there, of course, without it there can be no motion, but maybe that is a very good way to start to think of things. There is no really pure mental processes, cognitive processes. There is no pure physical processes. Everything touches everything. There is a wholeness and that wholeness is in motion. Yeah, the movement practice takes these beats and examine them. And here is a pragmatic thing. The scientist, the cerebral thinking about movement. This is important. The emotional side. Coloring, feeling the colors and the textures of motion. A lot of people who are involved with movement practice never end up feeling motions really focusing on how it makes you feel or how it feels itself. And then the actual movement, the action, action, emotion and thought. And those are three streams of movement and they interlace together into this kind of a braided experience and whole experience. And I try to bring all these aspects into my practice and the way that I live my life. I think most people who embark on a movement practice will first want to know which movements to do. Right? Squats, planks, pushups, pyrrhoettes, pick your movement. It could be any movement. Are there any sort of just basic entry points that you believe everybody should walk through as they embrace a movement practice? The first time and maybe even every time they do a movement practice. Earlier today I had the great privilege of being guided through a long series of movement practices. And yet the first practice we did involved at first anyway stillness, not movement. So if you would, could you inform us how people should think about approaching a movement practice? What is the first layer of any good movement practice? So you touch the word movements and it's important to for me to separate it from the word movement with a capital M. Movements are the containers and movement is the content and the content cannot be carried in any way without containers. So the first entry point is to choose containers and then the second thing to make sure is to put specific content into those containers and then enjoy them. I tell people that it's like a cup of water and you're being handed that cup of water and nowadays very often people will start to chew on the cup. Instead of drinking the water making it yours discard the cup. And then maybe later you want to have bone broth or soup so you use a different container, a bowl. So a movement practice to start can start from anywhere. It's a rhizome. It's it's an open system. It has no center. It's decentralized and it can be a put from anywhere and that's its magic and that's that's the benefit of it. Some people find the body a good entry point. Some people don't even enter from the body. Sometimes you can enter from other perspectives and then inside the body for example where should we enter if we decided to take the body approach. The spine can be a nice decision but some will choose just the pelvis. Any one of those points are valid and then playfulness can be an entry point and attribute or and this is so open. So I don't want to limit people and limit their minds in the way that the engage was a practice but I also want to encourage the self inquiry. Am I doing movements practice or am I doing a movement practice? So could you help me distinguish the two a little bit further? I think I understand the difference between I sort of the noun versus the verbs and in some ways here we are dealing with the challenge of you know that the barriers that the barriers that language present to something that's physical right I mean indeed there may not be a After assume there is no perfect verbal language for movement there are certain movements that defy language I could say somebody jumped at a particular trajectory at a particular speed and move this limb in that limb but by Fractionating it something is most definitely lost so if someone wanted to let's say get in better touch with their body in quotes in order to Explore the infinite space that is movement how might they begin to approach that is it does he begin with an awareness with practice or both. And it begins with education and that's probably the most stable point of entry awareness to something as a concept that it is a concept that there is validity or because sometimes people look for that to looking at this entity this open entity and that's part of the reason why answer in questions is. Something I can do or even attempt to do I believe in the power of the non-complete process like making this table but living something and done not perfecting the product why because it offers some kind of a dynamic nature of evolution that naturally unravels from it. Sometimes I do it I count reps and I only count to nine because it tends to live people in the count and it keeps going instead of giving them the ten everyone wants to end on ten. But because of the decimal system it's so all kinds of things like that is also important with the movement idea is to discuss to examine to look to taste to try but then also not to try to capture because if you like the invisible loop of Hofstad if you look at it too closely it's gone but if you look away it functions and exists just like us very powerful and. And then we're going to discuss that we have. So when people enter movement practice it is about education bringing some awareness to the fact that they are living in a body that they are living in motion. And the other mind is a type of movement that their life is a type of movement. Bringing attention to the movement of the emotions as well. Bringing just attention to the fact that things are in motion. The the the the the your a cletus a pantare all influx. Nothing stops besides. Something that is the background of it and allows it to express and this is the beauty of things and this for me is the movement practice is is this examination and bringing this awareness into things as we sit now here. I'm also aware of my body. I'm also aware of the way that things make me feel the way that your face is communicating to me and and I'm not just. In some limited. And very verbal overly verbal state because it misses a lot of the beautiful flux. I'm going to inject some or projects and ideas and perhaps you would tell me if they're ridiculous. Potentially useful or useful. As I understand what we're talking about now and what we've discussed earlier is that movement. Can and should be incorporated into one's entire life. Even heard you say that even before getting out of bed in the morning one can experience movement and it doesn't necessarily have to be of the intimate kind with somebody else. It's. It can be paying attention to the rhythm of one's breath or how you get out of the bed or actually an anticipation of you arriving here today. I noticed that as I was going up and down the stairs in this in this house. That I was injecting a little bit of playfulness in the way that I might have many, many decades ago but haven't for a very long time and I asked myself. Whether or not that's what Edo is referring to when he's talks about threading this body awareness throughout the day. As opposed to. But of course not exclusive from just saying I have 45 minutes. I'm going to do movement practice before I shower and have some dinner right. I have to imagine both are helpful but in terms of moving through the day and having bodily awareness. Clearly there are an infinite number of ways one could do that. If you could just share a few you mentioned. I mean one could pay attention to their breath. I could pay attention to posture and this notion of play is a very attractive whereas we say in science it's a sticky concept a concept that kind of draws one in. Maybe if you would. Could you share with us just some ideas to get people thinking about it. Maybe even incorporating movement practice into their day and maybe even touch on the potential role of play or playfulness. Okay. Yeah those. Those are some good directions. I think one thing is this what you call wordlessness. I have been recommending to people non verbal experiences and the awareness of the body. Which is not really the awareness of the body. As you know. Not purely or not fully the awareness of motion. It's a very good way to start to bring awareness to that layer and that layer will start to get clarified more and more and more the more you practice. And then it will enable for most people a safe haven away from many states and difficulties and will unlock a lot of potential attributes and strengths and freshness and a lot of beautiful things. Really one of the really perspectives about who we are comes from person who influenced my thinking a lot more Sheffeldon cries the late musheffeldon cries and he talks about the body as the core three elements the core nervous system. Two is the mechanical system of muscle skeleton etc. And the third is the environment which is a unique way to look at it. And it talks about how the nervous system is both get receiving information from the outside and from the inside. And in the first years of life you work a lot on differentiating those what is me and what is not me. And I think movement when you feel movement you feel the movement of the outside. That is of course arriving to you and receiving this and also your own internal movement and the same can be said for stillness. So bringing the attention into those layers it's a tricky thing. It's one of those elusive things to look at but it's definitely of huge benefit to start to train it start to practice it to feel not our thoughts not necessarily our body. But to start to recognize the dynamic nature the flux the motion and it occurs and all these layers. So you can you will need to find it in multiple locations before you start to more and more make it your own make it really yours. How for example simple pragmatic things I used to do this I spent some time in Hong Kong. I would need to get my practice in but. I'm really turned off from commercial gyms and there is not a lot of nature accessible there so I would just strap on my bag. And I would walk the streets of Hong Kong which are very crowded and then I would try to avoid. And it would be like two hours of just like move involved fully involved fully in my body and experiencing beautiful things and enjoying and developing myself as well in all kinds of scenarios up and down and in the escalators and off. So this is an example of a way to to practice and then the way that we're sitting like this chairs for example our chairs are not very dynamic but there is rocking chairs right and. And this is something I recommend for a lot of kids like in schools I used to rock on the chair. Which is very common. Yeah, I used to wear my skateboard underneath my chair and roll it back and forth and the teacher would tell me to stop. I'm just slowly like little by little trying to get the most subtle movement I could without it you them telling me they were going to take it away. Which is probably horrible horrible advice and instruction just like sit up straight and chew with your mouth closed because they remove. A lot of the self education and a lot of the self development and the practical and discoveries that are necessary and even will damage focus and. Thinking processes in some ways. And so I will for example I would make the chairs even more mobile. And I would support more motion and then I would be able to bring attention there but I would also be able to bring attention away from it into other things and it keeps refreshing me. So I don't become stale the water doesn't stand this is the beauty of movement so you can focus for long periods of time and doing credible things with the mind with focus with awareness attention. And it's like whisking in the game so I'm not talking is some meditator and is describing the act of being very focused but then I put a stick on the edge of his fingers and I tell him balance it. He everyone can do it for 10 seconds and I tell him okay now hold the 10 minutes and you see that. The skill has he has no skin in the game. It wasn't developed in various scenarios but so there is a delusion that start to develop. And that's how movement keeps me very honest and humble in the way that I view humility and in a way that protects me and keeps me. Yeah, it keeps me fresh. I love the example of moving through the crowded street with a backpack because of the way in which it's completely adaptive to the situation you happen to be in and highlights the fact that. One doesn't need a gym or any specific scenario although we will certainly touch on ideal learning circumstances for movement and some of the work that you're doing of course. The less of your own personal practice and understanding and knowledge you've done the more toys you need. The more you've really worked on yourself the more high tech you are the more low tech are your tools the more high tech you are and this is the most advanced technology by far on this planet with all the advanced methods doesn't even start to scratch and you know it from the way that we understand the eyes all the way to with all to respect to the Boston robotics. A five year old motion movements or animal motion was very underdeveloped still relatively to us systems so important to remind ourselves. A lot can be done with the body and gravity. A floor, a piece of floor, a piece of wall, a corner of a room is a beautiful scenario which you can become discover in and play in and. But we are not so developed so we don't see those options and this is something that I tried to stimulate and that's why I made it a point to avoid any of the big. And I'm a sponsorship and high tech tools and I on point brought a stick into you know big conventions and and see or I sometimes I use the shirt with holes in it that just like a use shirt as a point to make when I'm addressing a crowd to keep things. Very important and it's important we are important and our experiences important and we have to be very careful these these habits and these directions they come from many times good intention but they are. The devil many times they turn into the devil just like our technology nowadays and what is happening with people with depression with meaning meaningless and also with the body in various perspectives or even I will also flip it into high performance sports and. The their price because for me this is not a movement practice it raises the person in the center of it and then came places like skateboarding or break dancing or somebody with a disability becomes the best in the world turns it into the biggest advantage but you would never be accepted into gymnastics class and I love that and that that change to place change in the center it. It's important. It's a shunna mention of a few sports maybe it was Charles Paul Quinn or maybe it was another trainer that I heard once say that you know for kids. One of the worst things they can do is over specialize in a particular sport. The idea being that it leads to improvements in performance in a very narrow domain but they raised the idea that it perhaps also constrains the development of the nervous system such that. Certain emotional state search and certain intellectual abilities will forever be shut off because of the intense plasticity that occurs early in life. The more I learn from you the more I'm thinking that that statement really should be extended to all of life and I loved. To remind people that because I start off as a developmental neurobile just that development doesn't start and end you don't have childhood and adulthood. Our life is one long developmental arc from birth until death however long that might be. So if one is going to be anti specialist maybe even call that a generalist. What does that look like what are the different domains of movement practice and as I asked this I realize I am in serious danger of fractionating movement into a list of words like strength and speed and explosiveness and suppleness of word that I've heard you used before and yet I think for most people because we think in words often. Some of those categories can be useful so let's say I was going to embark on a movement practice or a child was going to embark on a movement practice and either throughout the day or for a dedicated period of time. What are the sorts of categories of movement that I might want to think about. Ballistic movement smooth movement maybe you could just enrich us with some of the some of the landscape around that. Okay first I'll address the first part that you mentioned and I've learned from you about certain changes in the way that things develop later in life versus earlier in life and you write it is something that just polyquin also mentioned and I learned from back in the day as well from him. Which can seem dark a bit and then kind of hopeless but then you should go beyond that one thing that does seem to to appear for me when I look around. This concept of unique postures and I think this is true for postures of thought emotional postures and movement postures. Truly earlier in life we are creating these unique postures and they get into these drawers or like a language letters later in life. The process moves more towards integration of this unique postures into all different organizations. The beauty of it is that you can use very few postures to create many possibilities just like a live needs search for a language that contain one symbol only versus two which he discovered. And this is something that is often seen like you take someone who moves in a certain way and you teach him all these new sports or techniques but essentially if you look deeply in your sensitive you see it's the same postures that he will have to work with till the end of his life. The same thinking postures and these this is really problematic where we are we are not freeing the mind beyond this how would I say a scaffolding of thinking and we are actually letting go of the content we we get more and more focused on the. The way the way of thinking versus the thinking itself or habitual ways and forms of thinking associated thinking etc. And emotionally the same we are constructing this emotional postures and then we have to go through the rest of our lives working with that. So this is the dark side but of course there are always possibilities and both I think invading this early system to some extent even if it's 5% or 7% or whatever percent. And also on the freeing yourself of going beyond all postures period. Working with the postures you have but towards a posture less way of doing things so this is something interesting to work when you when people work with movements but. Finally are able to go into movement and this magic starts to happen and then the techniques fall apart and something appears. And and it's a face change it's a it's a transformation it's not it's a binary moment there is a jump there for sure and it's very rare to see both in thinking and emotionally and in other ways we have many names for it and some talk about enlightenment and some. Talk about all kind of processes related to it and I think most of them are shadows of the sun but it's not the sun itself really. And then talking about ways of thinking about movement this is where I use something I called my slice and dice because of the problem of using words and definitions and categories I try to create a lot of them. And I write them on on the paper and then I crumble them throw them into the bin and I keep doing it all my life. The writing them down and the gicking on it is very important also very important to let it go. I tell people what you forgot is not the same for forgetting is not the same as never knowing it. The crumbling and throwing away is a form of forgetting but it leaves some kind of a homemade pathic trace behind. So let's take some slice and dice and try to look at it here is a physical one contraction relaxation. That's a spectrum and pretty much everything falls on this spectrum also in terms of analyzing a person or yourself. You can tell me if you feel closer to this side or closer to that side and then it allows you to examine your practices how many of the practices are. Moving you towards balance and how many are its your addiction of just doing what you're good at versus what you need. And here is another example physical culture. So we have the dense real working with internal concepts and expressing them abstract concepts expression. Second perspective the Marshall. Because I but not in the sense of just fighting but also partnering. Working with another person a dynamic entity that is communicating with you. The third one is I call the elements working with the environment. The next one is a somatic one is the internal practice and of course they are all gray zones and and another one is object manipulatory. Which you can think of it also is the environment but it's more small objects heavy objects many objects few objects and then you can look at this way of thinking and you can say. I have many of my practices in this direction but not and you can draw it for yourself. So that's another perspective and this way I use dozens of perspectives and with the years it gives people a sense of where they want to go. And what they need to address versus what they like to address it. Is it helpful? Very helpful. Those different bins are very helpful. I really appreciate that you mentioned that people will often practice what they're good at as opposed to what they need in gym culture. We refer to this as the guy that always skips leg day person. You know big upper body skinny legs or you'll see people that have this enormous torso and bench pressing all day but they clearly need to pull on an object everyone's in a while to create some balance but they don't do it because. For whatever reason. They have an obsession with moving greater and greater poundage or something like that. Which in certain sports like power lifting where aesthetics aren't the goal and it's simply to push more weight off one's chest you could imagine that there's something beneficial there. However, I think that it's really important in intellectual endeavors and in movement endeavors for understanding correctly to bring oneself to a place of real challenge on a regular basis. In fact, earlier today I was in a state of constant challenge because it was all new to me. And as much as I told myself beginners mind beginners mind beginners mind it's hard. It's hard I confess to not want to do well to perform well right and and I think that's a natural and healthy thing. And only natural it is necessary. But I want you to keep it on that side and to bring something to balance it. If there is not this challenge the process will not work. It has to be this scale and you're talking about scales of pain pleasure and this is another scale. And this discomfort again is necessary and should be recognized as I'm in the right place when it becomes too high and I'm unable to resolve to make any progress. I went overboard but when it's not present. I don't do nothing here nothing that I'm truly interested in. I'm just gratifying myself. Sorry is in essence. It's not about searching for the discomfort but it's a marker. And I think the question should be who am I serving? Because people do not serve themselves in essence. They serve part parts of it. Some kind of a fraction of themselves and this separation of oneself from oneself and this is also a result of the practice a good practice. I think maybe the biggest gift I received from the practice is I'm I can say although it will take a certain context. I'm not my friend. At times I am but many times I'm not my friend and by creating this separation I can assume a certain stability in the face of everything all the way up to our own mortality and death which is and maybe beyond who knows. It was a striking moment for me earlier today when I was really challenged with one of the practices we were doing and you said this is exactly what I experienced this morning and that's what you said. I couldn't imagine that you were having challenges doing what I was attempting to do and of course you were what I believe what you were referring to is that you had put yourself at that edge earlier than the day in which you were making failures. You were failing to execute the way that you were attempting to execute movement. I should just to inject some neuroscience and neuroplasticity there I can't help myself. This is what I do after all. There are beautiful data in animals and human showing that in the seconds and minutes after a failed attempt at a motor execution or something. The forebrain is in a heightened state of focus and when you hear it suddenly makes perfect sense of course why would the nervous system change unless you're in a certain state of focus? It's a change unless it got a cue to change and the cue almost always comes in the form of frustration that the act where as we said earlier, the mass signal is the one that preps you to extract more learning from the subsequent trials and yet for a lot of people they feel that, failure to execute or even to approximate execution and they feel and experience the negative signal and they lean out of the practice. They start to depart either mentally or physically or both. If there's anything I think that we can offer is this understanding that that edge is some people call it or that failures aren't just necessary. They are part of the learning process. They are the entry gate to neuroplasticity. Yes, contextualizing or re-contextualizing that sensation is something I work a lot with and I just remind that people and I also remind that to myself. If it wasn't difficult and we didn't need to redo it again and again we wouldn't be again on this correct scale which is dynamic and moving just like rolling down hill. So the reason there is definitely an necessity to succeed to orient the certain aspects that you want to achieve but then there is also the letting go of it and the deambitioning of it and within that tension, the plus and the minus comes movement and that's how that and again if I stretch it too far away or if I increase one of them too much then I would have some issues but you will with practice learn to recognize the optimal point of progression. Of course it takes many years and a lot of play and exposure to get a sense of it regardless of the layer in which it is applied. So I'm sure in your field and in your pursuits you are already aware of it and applying it in your life talking about focus talking about ways of thinking creativity etc. But then it's enough that I pull into another perspective and you will see that people are specialists and then they don't have really the real essence of the concept. It's not theirs. It's applied specifically the one who changes all the time gets the general component because what appears when everything changes that is that new entity. Everything changes something stays that's what we want to get this concept and this understanding. I've heard the statement before we are just a meat vehicle right we're just a sack of cells and it's and I truly despise that statement because first of all it. It deprives us of all meaning of our lives and we can go down the route of philosophy as to whether or not there's meaning or not. But more importantly it divorces us from the idea that the body and brain are interconnected and have at least equal value at any one moment that they're informing each other emotions and form movement movement and forms emotions. One thing that I've heard you say before I'm really I've to hear you in Belechon is this is important principle that human beings are truly unique in terms of the enormous range of movements that we can perform. And yet we are excellent maybe superior to all other species at certain types of movement. The one that comes to mind is walking stride striding. So maybe we could just explore that that idea because obviously a cheetah is very fast. The given seems to have a lot of proficiency at grabbing and swinging from branches. But human beings perform an enormous or can potentially perform an enormous array of movements. Do you think all human beings are potentially able to explore all the different types of movement. And if so, how does one approach that so basically what I'm doing is I'm tabling a concept which is not range of motion right for the for the gym rats discard with range of motion. I'm talking about the variety of movements. First is not important what I think if it's possible or not possible or if it's even possible for you or not possible for you. What is important is what you truly want to do what you truly are after. And it's important for me because many times this way of thinking about things is already limited. I like to say a man doesn't go to the ocean to empty it with a spoon. A lot of the types of dressing up of the concepts nowadays is trying to fit an elephant into the hole in the needle. Like for example the concept of practice and then our lives as if we have a life. We have some kind of a stream of behaviors. We have the result argument of free will etc. There is a multiplicity definitely a man is a legion that's the real meaning of that phrase. One day you wake up like this I say Andrew let's meet tomorrow at 7 a.m. but I don't know who's going to wake up tomorrow. And then you send me text message. I'm feeling off. It's 6.55 and go back to sleep. Examining that and seeing that I think free is you up eventually and start to orient you in a better direction. So what do you want to do and what but in the orientation of also what you need to do? What you sense and what you are developing as a evolutionary direction for you. This is the important bit. Is it possible for everyone to engage in certain specific physical movement for example in Scandinavian countries? The squat is not very approachable. It's very difficult. There are more built for dragging heavy things and also in this climate I guess it makes less sense to squat and because you're going to freeze there. So this is and then you see the squat in warm climates and it's like so open and accessible. They're very good dead lifters usually not good squatters. They get away from the ground. Yeah. The shallow hips socket which allows one activity but then the stability of the deep hips socket architecture of of the hip. The femur heads, the keywengels, the shapes etc. So we are all unique and there are certain elements which like for example my squat challenge is like for most people there is something there. But you remind people what the squat challenge is. What was my attempt to bring a new fresh state of mind into the words squat? Not as a strength element. It's a fundamental resting position really. Actually should be one of the most abundant ones we replaced it with seating which is not really doesn't work well. If you're in a natural environment it's not very comfortable actually to sit for long periods of time rocks and different terrain. So you end up lying down standing and squatting a lot. Also when you're moving low and dynamic like even collecting berries the squat is much more dynamic and open. And then elimination is happening there. So it's like it's such a fundamental thing and we totally eliminated it. We eliminated many other things overhead movements behind the back all kinds of back real and what I call the back real. And it's totally absent in in people's awareness. So that was my attempt to bring it back into people and I recommend I recommend that to in order to really get the transformation going to accumulate. 30 minutes a day in the squat position unloaded just resting down not correct not correct. Many people make this mistake that didn't read through the whole thing. It's just resting down there. You have to be mindful of those edges some people will get hurt if they try to do it too quickly. So they might need to build up process towards it and also I'm not talking about 30 minutes straight. But accumulation throughout the day and this does a lot of good for digestive problems for lower back pain for hip pains for knees and generally for aging because it's basically. Holding your body in the most basic way are you folding your body if you're not folding your body. You will lose the full ability of your body and this is probably the easiest and the most abundant way to fold the body. So, but this is an example of something that can be very useful with many many people but there will always be unique individuals which need something else. There are benefits in examining things and also there benefits in getting hurt. She's not often discussed especially not in these parts. So I'm one of the only ones as a teacher that says I injured many of my students. And if I did not do that I would be totally useless for them as well. The totally safe system has nothing to offer. Practically nothing is totally safe and we can of course we don't approach it with a ballsy or machoistic thing but we are aware that sometimes we have to go beyond the boundaries. And hopefully those would be the small injuries that will help us avoid the big injuries. But if you try to avoid the small injuries maybe you'll get those big injuries in there. So examining which types and forms of movement, the location of the body speed of execution, the type of organization of the body which is a whole thing that we can discuss. All of this is up for the grabs and something that we have to create in the visual relationship with hopefully with good guidance where we can get. The right scenarios, a facilitator of good scenarios for our learning which is what I try to do. And less of a technical state of mind do this ABC or you're like chunking what I really dislike from long ties like many people they tell me. Have you met this guy? It's an amazing teacher because he chanked the process into this bits and not even in the correct places to chunks. And it doesn't offer it locks us this state of mind. I talk about the chemistry model. My I call it my chemistry model. An atom and molecule and then a compound is conceptualized versus just chunking. So there is an actual evolution like I call it also sketch learning. I'm not going to try to draw you. If I know anything about art and drawing, I'm going to start by capturing something very rough. And I need to practice that first that dynamic entity before I go into the rendering and the shading etc. So the same way to learn things. So big picture to small details and unlike many of my teachers in the tyrant into and I say with the greatest respect because I don't know who taught me more my good teachers or my worst teachers. But some of them just teach from the small details into a big picture that never arrives. Given that humans can generate such a broad array of types of movement run jump, duck squat, leap at all these types of movements. Do you think there's value in observing the movements of other animal species? I know I certainly enjoy watching other animals move. I think the most one of the more spectacular animal facts that was shared with me is when I was a graduate student. Someone down the hall was working on the little pedals of the communion. As it which can walk up walls and it was a great mystery is whether or not they were suction, but turns out they can do it in a vacuum. So it's not suction whether or not there was some sticky substance and it turned out. I feel compelled to share this with you so I'm going to do it. I have a feeling it will lead us to an insight of some sort that those little tiny pedals are so thin and so close together that the the communion actually sticks to the wall by what are called vendor wall forces. Meaning it's a very weak molecular force but strong enough to stick to the wall because they are actually exchanging molecules with the surface they're on. So obviously we can't do that and yet I spent hours because they were in the lab next door watching videos of these little communion walk and the articulation of these feet is incredible because they're literally rolling those little pedals along in a way that it kind of defies anything else I'd ever seen. I told myself this was useful. A because I thought it was interesting but be because I never really thought about how I articulate my foot. I've thought about being a heel striker a toe striker when I run and no one can tell me which one I'm supposed to be. Maybe you can you can tell me but the point is or I suppose the question is. Do you think there's value in observing the extremes of animal kingdom movement as a way to inform the place space and the exploration space of our own human movement practice. I think so I think it's first it's inspiring it's. It opens up but I will take it away from the romantic point of view and I would offer another way to examine all these movements exist in us. In ways in certain ways like the work of a grock of vetsky on the spine the spinal engine and to see how this. All the ways of moving even all the way up to exoskeletons and like primary very ancient or even single cell things are still within us to a certain extent and then of course these gets developed. Like the Darwinian state of mind got stuck for many years on the survival of the fittest. But actually I believe I always believe the nice I saw some information about it lately that mutation is the heart of the model not survival of the fittest. Yeah people often hear the word mutation and they think omutations are bad there are maladaptive mutations and then there are adaptive mutations for sure. And it displaces the word change in the heart of it. What it wants to do change. So it does not want to become better. There is an inherent change in it and then of course that become better at XYZ fittest is the secondary perspective that arrives in relation to certain things but there is still a stronger more ancient driving force into the process. So for me this is cool to see these animals take it all the way to this extreme but it's also still reflecting within us. So I love to do like for example I introduce with people spinal waves and by bringing these waves into the body sometimes you get weird experiences like emotional releases and sometimes and and and other times it can become an incredible tool to help and athlete which specialise. And reach the top of the top and then you defrag his system a little bit and offer him some freshness and some segmental movement and first you fuck him up. That's usually the case technically his off is coordination so but later the growth will arrive it's a form of playfulness. It's a form of examining things regardless of their success or failure more understanding the change is important and then after that we can also look at the more. Competitive state of mind and the more success and failure orientation and but there is no game without change. So this is the primary one and that's why I say okay you want to succeed in the tasks like we did earlier but you stayed within the game to sustain the game the infinite versus finite game right perspective. To sustain the game means to continue to change continue to transform and then to win the game sometimes mean game over. So it's like yeah within that tension I think it's beautiful to play and to exist and to be. You mentioned something that for me is an incredibly important concept for a couple of reasons and you mentioned these spinal waves right I have to assume that's taking the torso for us you know. I'm going to move more on so that I'll just refer to course terms and set the RASX spine server I mean I will stay away from the technical anatomy and the torso and creating movement either side decide on your on gelation or arching and extension of the spine. Yeah, torso ventral side to side rotational as was spiraling. Do is. Have you ever had the experience that of yourself or other people engaging those types of movements and experiencing particular categories of emotions and I have a particular reason for asking this there's no right or wrong answer of course but I'm just curious. Whether or not movement of the let's call it the core of the body things close to the midline as opposed to far away from the midline like the digits for is there any. Do you have any evidence that that can evoke a certain category of emotional states evidence I have none but I have experience and I have some thoughts about it. Either role. Is known to have created role thing or structural integration said the issues are in the tissues and around the spine the spine is us as you know I can take an arm off a limb but. There is there's been attempts but there is no brain alone this cerebral thing alone that the spine and maybe more parts of systems inside the torso are important so that's why I like to start from that core entity and then these little fluctuations they create. The things that they start to move things and you can avoid funny enough mobilizing those areas by doing big frame motions and competitive motions and techniques all your life. Most yogis for example they look extremely mobile but then when you're actually going into the small what what I call the small frame I borrowed this from Chinese martial arts small frame big frame the big frame is these big changes of our. Total body in space posture and then the small frame is barely moving but mobilizing the little bits that comprise the same pretty much posture so these are very beneficial and it has totally disappeared from our physical culture. We introduce it back. The small frame offers the big frame but the big frame doesn't offer the small frame because of course the small detail come together into the big picture so if I want to place my body in specific position and I have all these bits moving well I can construct it in whatever way I want but if I just work on the big one. More most chances are I just mobilized certain areas while other areas are totally held or blocked and then I'm specialized one more time taking out of this real and I'll have difficulties. But we'll sit there in this stagnation emotion material thoughts traumas that's why people get these charges. The body the memory is not what we think it is that's how I believe it is stored in a lot everywhere. And I've had those experiences a lot of people have the opposite when a certain emotion is evoked they start to undulate the spine. So this can be worked from this direction and I believe by applying such a practice. It is wise you basically turn over the land and you are allowing things to to shift and to move and to adapt. So I highly recommend it and we teach it in a very elaborate and gradual way and and this is needed really because people when they just go into like some general recommendation they usually just get stuck into a new pattern. That's final way. Okay, that's it. So I've been using again this slice and dice like teaching dozens of systems of moving the torso until a person is free to really move the torso like the language is created the the small enough units are created in your understanding from all these systems and then you improvise you reach the highest level of the practice. I love the answer I let me tell you a bit of why I asked. So there's a principle in neural in neuroscience but especially in neuro evolution they call it evo divo sometimes evolution and development how those link. And if you look at so we have motor neurons as you know but for the audience that live in our spinal cord that cause transmission and contraction of the muscles allows to move our limbs. And then we have motor neurons up here called upper motor neurons that control the motor lower one so one something is reflexive or learned we we're not thinking about it so to speak we mainly use the lower motor neurons we know this because you can do an experiment it's a rather barbaric experiment but it's been done many times. Called creating a deserabrit cat you actually remove the neocortex and these cats will walk on a treadmill it's called effective motion no problem at all there are human beings who don't have a neocortex or much of their neocortex is missing they generate perfectly fine movement. And it has been downloaded that's right and it's truly downloaded into the into the spine and the connection between the spine and muscles now the motor neurons that control the spinal waves as you call them. Are of a particular category that you have a molecular signature of physiological signature they were identified by he's dead now but a biologist at Columbia University and Tom Jessel and many of his scientific offspring here's what's interesting. In fish or in animals that really only have the opportunity to undulate and flap their little you know fins. The motor neurons that control undulation in those animals are identical molecularly to the motor neurons that control the spinal undulation in humans what's been added in human evolution are extra rows literally categories of molecularly distinct neurons so that as you move from the center of the body outward. Unlike a fish which can move its fins but can't actually articulate doesn't have digits we have special motor neurons to move these little bits these bits these bits and I can't do a spinal wave but but I can do that and move just thing like the belly thing. That comes from seeing the movie ET when I was a kid and puffing out my stomach and realizing that I could. Wave it but only in one direction. Okay. Not up anyway. The the yogis out there can chuckle at that but. The yogis actually do it to the side. Oh do that. Yeah. I don't know if I can do that. Anyway, my spinal wave is weak but I'll work on it. But what I find so interesting about these layers of I don't want to say sophistication but these with evolution. Came the addition of more pools of opportunity. He's motor neuron pools as they're called their opportunity to engage in. The addition of new more elaborate types of movement but with each new pool. He came the opportunity to create combinations of new movement and so the reason I asked you why spinal waves create one category of movement is that if you touch a fish on one side of its body. It moves to the opposite side. It never moves toward it. But earlier we were doing a practice somewhat similar of testing this similar reflex. Sometimes I or someone will move toward a touch. We don't deviate to the opposite side. So I have this. Untested, at least formerly tested hypothesis that movements of small digits and portions of our distal as they're called far from the midline body parts. The movement of the core of our body and the stuff closer to the spine. Again, it's just a theory but I'm grateful for your answer because it lands at least in the general vector direction of my idea here. The neutral orientation is mostly gone from our culture. We don't even walk basically these days. If you look at traditional culture, the amount of walking you do on a rest day on a it's huge and so we started to create technologies to bring everything into the periphery. Let's maybe promote it or offer it for females. So you get this peripheral pattern instead of a central generated pattern that progresses towards the extremities. One thing I wanted to ask you is I know an area that is not often mentioned is that some of these ancient patterns and systems are primary in many ways. Once those newer developments inside of us are constrained by using the connections running through these ancient systems. Hence, we are much more limited by the gene pool. We are hitchhikers on a piece of DNA, like to say. And that gene pool is driving something so primary that even when you are in the driver seat in your eyes, you're actually not or you're being totally constrained by that. And I want to hear about this. Recently, we had a guest on the podcast named Eric Jarvis. He's a professor at Rockefeller who was offered a position to dance with the Alvin Ali dance company. So in a accomplished dancer and comes from a musical family, chose to become a neuroscientist instead and study speech language. But he said something incredible. Several incredible things. And he said, really looking forward to getting your reflections on. First of all, he said that when you look at the species in the kingdom of animals, including us, that have a lab-rit language and true song, they all also have the capacity to dance. All of the, it turns out hummingbirds actually have a dance and a song capacity that perhaps, and this is the going idea now in neuroscience and evolution of the brain, that singing actually came before, finally articulated speech and language, that voice involved first to sing to communicate. I mean, to a non-ceite, you know, but then song may have come first, where you have song, you have dance and the capacity to dance, which of course is movement of the body. And where you have song and dance, you always find that those species can generate elaborate language. Now, the simple version of this is, okay, sophisticated brains tend to create clusters of sophisticated capabilities, but the other possibility. And it's the one that Jarvis proposes, and I think it's in line with what you're perhaps raising here is the idea that movement of the body and range and sophistication of movement of the body through all these different systems may have actually promoted or even driven the evolution of the things that we think of as, you know, speech and language and the ability to have multiple words for the same concept or to have a lab-rit articulation of speech. I find this incredibly attractive as an idea because certainly from as a hierarchy of needs, we needed to move first to survive and to made and to flee and to attack. It makes perfect sense to me that the layers would be built up fundamentally from the body to the mind and not the other way around. So that's one piece and then the other piece which I'll just share for any reflections you might have that I just blew me away was. Jarvis told me that when we read, if and this has been done experimentally, if one records the EMG, the low level muscular activity in the layering sinferings, we are actually repeating the words that we read, but so subtly so that we don't actually speak them out unless there's some sort of neurologic. There's some sort of neurologic deficit which some people have. Some people mumble why they read, but what that tells me is that language is movement and movement is language. So again, we have this convergence but at a very basic level, I'd love your reflections on those are all his ideas. I want to say I'm just repeating what he said and not nearly as precisely as he did. But how do you think of movement as either the foundation of language or as its own language that perhaps even defies words? Well, those are beautiful perspectives and I definitely feel the same. There's a lot to say about singing and dancing as well and also as a form of ancient programs of transmission. Sometimes there is this in some ancient practices, the mantras and people don't realize that they are tantric practices. They contain a form of vibrating and breathing. We all tie together into very elaborate way to promote a certain effect and how would you do something like this in ancient times? This is ingenious. We even until today we need a full book to describe something in it would work as well. So it's like a very ancient form of transmission. The more accurate we became with the language, the more dead it became because it is less of a movement entity, it is less of a dynamic entity from its nature. That's why Yukiyo Michima says it's corrupting. It corrupts us. So definitely definitely the the producing force or the primary force for me is movement that is experienced. Every time we talk about movement basically even now we are spilling it into a container to call it what it is but it is beyond that. So then it is applied into dancing into singing into language. There is no other language that I see as a primary mode and this is a nature of space time. Things moving. So I think everything moves into the direction of understanding that more and more and maybe it is not so popular to call it movement. People have some connotations and it is okay you can throw away this word and put another word and we probably need to do that also like regularly. I start to see the end of this word for me. Things get corrupted again overused the abused and then we need a new word. And that's even that word is only needed for communication and for specific processes of education exchange. It's important to stay within the experiences. It's important to continue to promote scenarios in which the experience is primary. More open experience let's say and not try to hold down and define overly accurately or if it's done throwing it away and starting again. So there is no winning concept. You got to the winning concept, you got nothing. You were able to grab it, you were able to this very science, right? We got it. We got it and then it turns out to be nothing and more and more time passes. I feel science is becoming more humble and things are being discussed in this way and because really what the science do report the sun came up certain amount of billions of times and then tomorrow it will come up. Yeah, it's good prediction. But we can go beyond. There is something inside of us that can go beyond hard to communicate. I can't offer it right now here but I have the experience and thankfully I have a practice and a way to sense it to feel it and to reexamine it and then we can talk about it and have something from that. Edward Wilson, the great sociobiologist. He actually founded the field of sociology EOL Wilson, they call him Edward Wilson. He had this beautiful word and indeed named a book. Actually the word was better than the book. Sorry Wilson, but the book was a little bit meandering for my taste but then again he's the Harvard professor not me. Well, the Stanford's pretty darn good. This word is conciliance. This idea of a leaping together of divergent forms of knowledge to create a truly valuable concept which I love. I love it because of course I'm formally trained as a scientist and I look at things mainly through the lens of neuroscience but experiences real and observation is real and even in the field of medicine you have you know double blind placebo controlled clinical trials and then you have case studies. And of one right not often discussed right I mean HM the most famous example in neuroscience of a patient that had no hippocampus informed us more about the process of memory and indeed the function of the hippocampus. Then thousands of independent experiments that followed so you can't have one you need all these different forms of exploration which is you know I think I think we share the belief if I may that Convergent forms of knowledge eventually this process of concealing it can eject a new concept and yet the challenge again is that if we don't have a language for it it becomes hard to transmit. One of the things that I find incredibly I'll use this word again sticky is this notion of movement culture. I don't know who coined that phrase or I've seen it in the circles and accounts around your Instagram account and others I don't know if that's a phrase that you coined but this idea of engaging in movement practice with others whether or not it's dance or other movement practices. Because it's so dynamic there's the unpredictability of it even to like today to practitioners at vastly different levels of knowledge and experience and movement practice there's information I like to think to be gained from both sides. So one thing that I've heard you say before which really resonate with me is this idea that people have maybe particularly the US have this concept of I have my yoga friends or my the people I dance with are distinct from my family friends are distinct from but as you pointed out gathering around movement is an. age-old tradition and that perhaps we better off not thinking about people we exercise with or train with but. That friendship and connection made through movement is perhaps the most valuable form of connection. I think it's a product of those practices that are maybe not so aware or not so movement oriented in the open sense and then you get this. Sensation with people but alone we do nothing so much so that we're never alone also on the inside and we will manufacture and and produce entities. Inside so we're constantly in a dynamic exchange cultural exchange and practically I learned this lesson in Capoeira. It's a cultural manifestation things happen within this context we rub against reality we rub against each other. And their movement occurs and their insight is to be gained and development happens. And then comes other thoughts collective knowledge versus self knowledge. We are transmitting knowledge if we go on top of some mountain 20 people 20 normal individuals and we spent 20 years. Just fighting for hours in the morning for hours in the afternoon. We do it for 20 years but we're isolated from any other source of knowledge we would still not reach anything that. A very young fighter these days has. We won't be unable to develop those techniques those insights that's where collective knowledge comes in and transmission jumps us forward. But what is the problem with that staying within just those technical constraints and never making it yours that's the the part of self knowledge. The digestion of this collective information until it becomes digested and becomes part of yourselves and then you are it versus you are doing it and this is a clear separation that you can see in sports on a very high level and on a not so high level even though. I would be honest if I say that some people reach very far just with collective knowledge and a very technical approach and others reach extremely far with very little of it. And there is always outliers there are always the outliers in that case and others thought I had when you mentioned evil, evil. Evolution development is also the Greek concepts of poise and peace and and and and pieces. The growing of the seed into the tree. And the other process of the manufacturing of the chair from the tree. And the other processes of development evolution very different one from everything to something the other from nothing to something one is accumulation based one is substraction based. And the processes relate to collective knowledge self knowledge but they're not exactly just that and what is what should we do this is a question that my friend the Ross Musi he asks in his thesis and thoughts. What is the ultimate for us should we manufacture our chair or should we grow like into the tree. Is it in this way or should the mind also be left wild. Well why is this is a nice combination of words I like to place together wild wise, so. to bring into the way that I live my life and my practice and I try to bring the information and the wisdom and the collective knowledge but I also try to let go of more and more until an essence is gleaned until something is appearing and because everything was already there. For example, if I'm sitting here, all the movements are already occurring, all the possibilities are so it's just about I need to open I open this window the air would come from here if I open this window there would come I don't need to drive my motion I need to discover what is stopping it from happening something is constantly holding and when we remove this immediately movement appears this is really deep movement versus the driven movement that is very wasteful at times like walking you see people pushing through the walk instead of the controlled falling that you should be fighting, punching, manufacture the strength and then to have someone who knows how to facilitate the conditions in which you are knocked out it doesn't knock you out it hits versus I hit like Bruce Lee said so this is a beautiful thing to examine and to work within that so as to see am I skateboarding am I using this perspective or am I trying to to control because of risk and danger I'm trying to overly control something that actually can never be controlled the way to control it is to let go of the control and then okay but what about all this collection of information knowledge that I can bring in where do I want to play I can play down here or I can play up here the collective knowledge is maybe take you further in and then you still go and need to do your individual work a lot of people like to romanticize on that and it's you don't need teachers we don't need nothing we don't need information it's not fully honest you don't need but depends on where you want to function and how you want to function they shouldn't be demonized but they shouldn't be overly glorified as well you mentioned about the opportunity for movement perhaps even all forms of movement coming from deep within a cut raises to mind in the neuroscience of motor systems we talk about motor neurons as I described the ones that actually evoke contraction of muscles and then there's this category of neurons that isn't often discussed but certainly exist aren't often discussed in kind of popular nomenclature of neuroscience which is the pre-motor system most of our movements are the reflection of certain patterns of transmission breaking through from the pre-motor to the actual motor in other words we are always in a participatory mode of movement and as and I think you the way you describe it you clearly intuitively understand as you feel it and you recognize it think of it as it's like a layer of neurons that's constantly humming ready to go and it's the release of these gates that allows movement to occur in a particular way could be very smooth could be very ballistic which is DNA the same turning off and but all the information is already there right and then the possibilities are just allowed so I'm allowed I don't do free will already but I am allowed to do I am there are possibilities and I am dancing within that dance but I am not the only dancer so that's that's my sensation at least with most states of being let's say maybe there is other states that could be reached a stability that will arrive from the waters from the movement of the waters this humming this potential possibilities to be in that state to vibrate like this is very powerful for our lives to wake up in the morning and feel that living thing is the feeling of movement and for me it's a result of the practice and so then it's easy not to stagnate and then the mind can stay focused for hours like we've done today and I can listen and tune in and I won't lose you which is very difficult like I haven't had a good conversation here in the US it's very difficult and I have had your attention and you're listening but it's rare it's rare that somebody can do that and and it's a struggle always a struggle but it's definitely my trick my dirty trick in you said you're allowed and again when I'm taking some of the language and what you report about your experience and I'm trying to map it to some concepts that relate to neural circuits in in the principles of neuroscience we talk about in structiveness versus permissiveness there are instructive cues like for instance the ability to pick up this pen right there's an instruction clearly there's a motor command but that's just one way of looking at it the way it actually works is that there's a pre-motor system that's already generating that movement and what we've done is we flung open the gate and allowed that movement to occur precisely surfing it right surfing that current or descurrent or another current or opening the window exactly and if you look it the formal study of movement and improvement of movement the most basic example I can give is like a tennis surf and they if you just they've done this many times over you map the trajectories and in a novice the the lines are all over the place it ends up looking more like a like a tangle of rubber band ball right whereas in the fetter or the expert you almost wonder if it's just one line being drawn but it's that the trajectories are incredibly stereotyped that's the reflection of one little narrow gate opening again and again and again and again and of course let me let me inject something here from an old neurologist you can say berenstein the Soviet and he talked about the grease of freedom and they did in order to increase productivity in Soviet Union I don't know if you've heard this story he was brought in to examine the movement habits of the workers and he collected some some information he placed he was one of the first the kinetic I don't know how it's called an English the kinetic capturing of motion with moving pictures in that time and so he placed these thoughts and they took this photos which became kind of moving and what he discovered was something very interesting the accuracy of the hit of the sledgehammer increased while the variance in the various points became more not less so it wasn't a fixed pattern it was a meta pattern and this pattern is adjusted in this way to achieve the perfect execution those were very early findings I'm not sure how does that sit with everything but I'm sure there is some tools to it for my experience basically the self-adjusting dynamic nature of the system allows you to reach a very constant and stable end result by being so open and letting go of your control the example you give fits very well with the one that I described before because in I'm recalling the experiment and people want to look this up it's a paper we'll put it in the show note caption a guy also happens to be a Harvard name Benso Levski hungarian I'm clearly pronouncing his name wrong but I know Benso and I remember the slide in my mind's eye and the trajectory that was mapped was the movement of the tennis racket not of the limbs themselves in the federer case so that I think aligns well with what you're describing yeah those that exploration of degrees of freedom is where the opportunity for real advancement and expansion of skill shows up as I think the way it's been described to me is that we go from unskilled to skilled and then there's mastery and then there's this top tier which is this beautiful thin layer that so few people occupy which is virtuosity in which the practitioner invites variability and chance back in as an opportunity to do truly new things I I it made me think many years ago this this kind of thinking about so what is that entity because obviously it's not technique and it wouldn't even be honest to say it's a movement pattern there is too much diversity there I started to talk about the I called it movement sleeves or metat technique but the word technique is already misleading so there is some kind of a dynamic sleeve in which you can move as long as you're not out of this sleeve you're still within the boundaries of achieving the result that you're after and then there are the result is adaptation of all these elements inside to keep you in the sleeve the sleeve is not constricted as we once thought oh beautiful technique there are many ways to skin a cat and and that experience and that variety that diversity goes into virtuosity it's true freedom because your focus is on the writing you don't point at the moon look at your finger and and and that's really an essence being a virtuoso for for me like mastery let's say the research a thing oh there's I do believe there is such a thing and I'll flatter in attempt to embarrass you by saying I think that I'm not alone in viewing you as a virtuoso movement I think that's that I think that's what comes to mind because there's this notion that not everything is pre-planned that even you might not know what you're going to do next until the moment of execution but that here I'm projecting my own assumptions um I'd like to talk about mindsets in approaching practice a little bit more but I want to wait into that territory by talking about vision and the eyes something that we both share a deep interest in I from the background of visual neuroscience but also from the realization that you know we have this incredible ability to adjust the aperture of our visual window we can focus very narrowly and we can focus very broadly something I encountered I think first is a child realizing that I could spend all day watching ants play in a very fine domain and then look up and go inside and realize there's a whole world and realizing wow I'll never be able to consume the full range of experiences at any one moment their ants probably in the corner of this room doing their thing and so too are our approach to movement can be as you mentioned very big and dynamic in terms of the broad movements of our limbs or fine articulation when you begin a practice or and as you move through a practice do you apply a regimented way of focusing your vision are you in panoramic vision are you in a very narrow field of you or does it entirely depend and for the person who's a true beginner true novice like myself how should I show up to the practice with my eyes? The eyes are a good starting point as you help a lot a lot of people to understand and when you encounter difficulties with other layers it's very powerful to start with the eyes another thing important to understand and to experience you can't believe me or you gotta examine it for yourself we do not move the eyes as well as we think we do because as long as you can see and move the eyes people never think about it that it can be trained that it can be improved etc and their effects of it are far reaching the eyes lead to the inner eye you can think of it in a beautiful metaphorical way and it's a representation of the way that we use various cognitive and mind processes and also of course affect the body the eyes lead in many ways and the head is also a very because all of these inputs are coming in here so it's very easy to lead the body in if you look at a centered way from the head it's a very powerful and easy thing for example when when you teach boxers how to bob usually it's not done in the way that I I believe it should be done you teach it with the periphery they teach it from the feet because they have the idea which is correct that you need to do it in spatial conditions in movement in space but in reality the head will organize the feet for you instead you are now putting two elements together and then with the years of practice you hope of tying them together well I prefer to do something else because if I'll pull your head now to the side you will immediately start to organize your feet under you so I give you just one element to manipulate the system from that's how I would teach someone something like this many animals hunt with the head so you can see the body running forward while the head is turning to the side the whole thing follows afterwards so it's a very powerful way to address movement not the only one there are many modes thankfully and we were very adaptable and that but definitely a primary one and then the use of the eyes is of course maybe the most important element with that usually yeah what else can I say about the eyes is how do you come in will it depends on the practice you need to start to have some kind of a checklist of what you're looking to do and then by this you can start to tailor the way that you use your eyes the same thing I do for posture the same thing I do for stance the same scene eventually I do for state and there is different flavors there is no correct way to use the eye sometimes it's very peripheral soft open awareness orientation sometimes it's very focused notice I'm pulling these two opposites awareness and focus which is often put together and confused but and then the eyes are like the immediate and the easiest entry point into that and other thing is the placement of the head and the eyes like for example when we lower our chin we seem to see better when we raise the eyebrows there is too much exposure of top light sources so people would usually when looking into the distance will tilt their chin in and in many scenarios tilting of the chin to the side or placing just like listening with the ear, placing a certain eye or dominant eye depending on various scenarios and this is all like information that I can come in seri brili and think about and jump my practice forward instead of just letting the experience teach me that I'm using some kind of a thinking process to improve and this is not cheating this is great will it work we got to try it's a process and those are some thoughts and it'll start to play with yeah I love that you mentioned chin down because we all have a natural reflex when chin goes down eyes goes up and the opposite is true when head goes up eyes go down and there are two separate clusters of neurons in the these cranial nerve nuclei that as we call them when eyes are up it increases our level of alertness overall this is it not you know this is not woo science this is this is the the function of these cranial nerve nuclei when our eyes are down we go into states of more calm and quiescence and this makes perfect sense you know and then the eyelids usually go down and then people fall asleep eyes up does not mean head up because as you said there's a very dynamic control over the amount of luminance depending in the environment so that and then as you mentioned this difference between focus and awareness I think is a really important one when we are in this more panoramic soft gaze as um and broad awareness big big swaths of visual field as we say the neurons that control that come through a pathway called magnicella pathway in any event those neurons are much thicker thicker cables they transmit much faster just like thick pipes can carry more water more quickly and your reaction time is for at least four times what it is in this awareness mode then it is when you're narrowly focused on something and this is counterintuitive I think to a lot of people but the person who is running to catch the ball is not tracking the ball in a smooth movement the most of their vision is in peripheral vision when we drive we're in this peripheral vision and our reaction times are much much faster so I don't know if I'm reluctant to encourage people to shift toward a particular type of practice toward a particular type of vision I think what you and I I hope agree on correct me if I'm wrong is that exploring these different extremes and everything in between is where the real value is panoramic focused eyes head up eyes down head down eyes up playing with it and exploring it in as opposed to for the first ten minutes of practice being panoramic vision you know the sort of a earlier today we were joking about and kind of lamenting the fact that this word biohacking exists or that the optimal performance is that they're unfortunate terms because they suggest that if you just plug it in it's going to be like two plus two equals four and you're going to get it right every time another pragmatic bit here if I can offer is and since our culture has been more geared than pushing us towards focus the focus use of the eyes and primary language reading and other things we have less opportunities to work with the more open panoramic one so it would be smart to start to balance things out a bit more when you're in nature you don't look at each leaf everything is moving and you are kind of immersed in that and then something attracts your attention oh it's a bird and you focus and you go back into the general state the basic state which is open awareness here we switch things around in our modern culture we are mostly focused and then we sanitize daydream which is maybe some kind of some kind of a balancing act that comes from deep within I don't know maybe you can you can share some information about that but I see that many times people need to the focus is overly done by far in our lives yeah I couldn't agree more and I think a lot of I'll even venture so far as to say that the a lot of the visual deficits that we now see in young people myopia literally near sightedness occurs because if we look at things that are too close to us as children or as adults the eyeball actually gets longer the lens focuses the visual image in front of near to the lens near sighted then in front of the where it should land and basically it's a lack of panoramic vision that is or open awareness that's driving these changes and nowadays we are essentially most people are 90% of the time in this narrow focus mode you know right before recording we took a break and went up to look at a vista and to look off to the distance incredibly useful easy practice at some level but I think most people are not doing this sort of thing and the way that it shapes the mind and the perception of time of course is a whole other kingdom of ideas but one thing I'd like to relate this element of vision to and open awareness is earlier you mentioned the cone of auditory attention the other sense that we can play with in our practice and throughout the day do you see any value to both paying attention to things in a very narrow cone of auditory attention but also just walking and listening to all the sounds at once I could imagine that could be useful and in terms of physical movement practices I was going to say where your ears your ears are always more or less in the same place but where is your hearing when you approach your practice another set of parameters to think about and to play with and to be aware of also I have the experience that some people are better at using this system or that system and you would be amazed how differently the same results seemingly outside results are done by different practitioners and different scenarios this goes into this mutation and change ideas what really jumps us forward eventually some kind of a mutation so it's like all of our culture and practices and success puts a closer and closer to each other so we have the same opinions everywhere around the world becoming more and more the same lesson less different but the real hope comes from the different so and we have a difficulty in promoting that so this is another thing that can be promoted with the right practices the right for example I work with corporates or even work with governments before to bring in some of that freshness with simple habits in the workday or in the education of children or in in companies increasing productivity I don't really give a fuck but I'm there to give what I view is important and what is important it may be increases productivity but it's more important to me that it improves people's lives or involved and improves yeah being and becoming and becoming is to these two entities I'm not there I'm on my way I'm a process so thinking about here the way that people use their ears the way that people use listening again we can talk about placement of the head and posture sometimes angling as well sharper angle chin down some people tend to use the shape of the ear people who is different ears closer or further out this is it's if you're very sensitive and you're looking around you would see this is affecting people's motion even the shape of our face like the development of the vocal cords and speaking will totally change how we are how we look but how we listen also will do the same I don't have any proof of it but I'm it is something I believe in well people will even make their ears bigger right we we try to become like little fennec foxes or something but I mean a lot of people don't realize that's actually why we do this is to capture more sound waves right and the leaning is the the localization of sound is based on a simple brain stem calculation of inter or all time differences the time in which something the brain intuitively it just knows because it's a pretty hard wired circuit that if a sound arrives first to this ear then that ear that it's likely coming from over here whereas if it's dead center or rather that the two of the same time that it's almost you know ridiculously simple when one hears it no pun intended but it is an incredibly valuable way of thinking about how the architecture of the body changes our experience I want to along those lines earlier you mentioned something and it and it flagged an important question for me when I see people walking sometimes you know sometimes I think wow they really move in a strange way occasionally see somebody they walk really it's impressive for whatever reason you know and you just think wow they sort of glide along people come in different shapes and sizes short torso's long arms etc do you think that if people have a body type that facilitate certain kinds of moving and not others that they should intentionally try and move in the way that is right at the edge of the kind of friction and challenge in order to shape new possibilities or do you think that they should lean into the smooth execution of what comes most naturally to them I think a good practice is to have many walks because they're required of course there is a very efficient and endurance stamina oriented thing that if you have the experience it will naturally develop and unravel and if not you can get some collective knowledge and improve and then there is a lot of emotional things related to work like how I'm walking into a business meeting and or how I'm walking out of a bad situation and there is a lot of beautiful things to to research their practically with yourself trying to approach someone with the chin slightly down very linear very efficient in the straightest line or trying to approach someone a little bit more rounded from the side and you and tilting your head and you will see totally different results, totally different communication that happens over people's heads but if you're sensitive you realize that wow this opened door. Many people you start on the minus my sister my big sister Tali Shia always says I started on the minus why don't I start on zero with them you know so but it's it's part of the approach you can affect it and you can start even on the plus if you're the slime in as the practitioner needs to be so this is something to play with and to work with and then you have of course body proportions and ways and and we have all these like technical invasions mathematics and trigonometry and architecture they invaded our bodies they invaded our nervous system and now our work and our physical practices they look linear and efficient the path between two points is a straight line it's not this is biomechanics it's not mechanics nothing there is given there's no gospel so the walk is sometimes have to go around or sway from side to side and there is coiling and coiling and there are moving bits and what about the coordination of my breathing with my walk because if I walk too linearly there is less pumping of the air naturally in and out so now I have to forcefully bring it in and out I'm wasteful and that's why you see in less years this incredible runners especially in long distance doing things we never thought were possible in the most in the worst possible way that we use to think pronation and all kinds of things like our technical thoughts were totally misguided and wrong and then somebody comes in and does it in some way that is totally wrong and it gets results we could never get that's that's the beauty of playfulness experimentation change being different the as you're describing this I'm smiling because at one of my favorite neuroscientists he's out of the University of Chicago was in a meeting there was an argument about evolution of the nervous system and he said at the end and people were arguing about whether or not this gene in one animal was homologous to this gene in humans etc. I can get very dicey and he said very very appropriately that one of the major jobs of evolution is to take existing cell types and circuits and give them new functions but that can only be done through the playful exploration of new possibilities which I think maps very well to what you're saying that at the extreme thresholds of technical execution you know mastery mastery mastery you your obviously performance is very high but the opportunity for evolution of the sport or the music or the dance or the intellectual endeavors is limited because you're not introducing variability in the attempt to get proper execution you're limiting oneself. Hence I want to offer something that is relating to you we should be wary of defining the mechanisms and putting certain meaning with certain processes and ways because just history and experience shows it doesn't work well for us most times or it becomes like this much more elaborate thing even if we were somewhat in the right direction because even thinking this way can offer a lot like for example you're advisable heat dopamine like offers a lot of benefit but also can create problems and it can enclose something which the improviser will file them a givers right like take a pin some paper clip and you make it into something great and this is really our we are the biggest improvisers around like that's what made us who we are I think and this is incredible what what we can do with it you know the Russian American space exploration story was the space pen famous story about the development of the space pen. No it's a space pen. No I don't know what I think it's an urban myth I don't know if it's true but I like it so I use it or the was this of course space competition and the Russians put the first animal in space and the first one was on my cat monkey or something like that yeah and then like and they put the first a sputnik the satellite and man on in space but Americans took the man on the moon and on the way a lot of technologies got developed in the Americans because of lack of gravity out there developed a space pen with a huge investment the Russians used the pencil. So I don't know if it's I don't know if it's true I don't think it is but it represents something in the state of mind like you look at for example the military equipment in Soviet equipment it's all can do multiple things and it means that it's heavier it's less efficient it's not as light and but even the navy seals will still carry an AK with certain conditions why because you can pour a whole bucket of sand into the mechanism and it will keep running while the most advanced German heckler and cool and accurate and light weapons for every grain can get stuck and overly specialized and there is something about this openness that we humans need to keep and also maybe something for our leaders to be more of less specialist and more in this openness less capable in this or that way but more capable of doing the whole thing. I love the story whether or not it's a legendary not it's legendary because it's it's fantastic as you say in the laboratory whenever someone takes on a project and my lab I always say you know you have to ask yourself how much technical detail and challenge you want to take on because with more technology advanced technology yes there's the opportunity for more discovery but more downtime your PhD will literally take longer if you're going to use a microscope that's out of commission 30% of the time and you just have to understand that so there's a dynamic interplay there by the way I think that scientists get it right it's where you transmit the knowledge out of the scientific field because science have debate and everything you're not so connected of course this can happen as well but then when it goes out and the simple person without the experience takes it more as a gospel as a fixed thing and then it was just a report right it was just reporting some functions here and play with it see what it does for you because with all the greatest information that I can give the person will examine it and it might be not useful at all for this is the practitioner make it your own go practice try heat cold light movement awareness to this awareness to this and this is up to you to make it yours but we don't like to have this responsibility now people prefer to have the this will work the first time every time and we'll serve you best compared to everything else and while there are more reliable tools than others in my mind the more reliable tools tend to be ones that are grounded in our innate physiology as opposed to some I don't like the word hack in fact I love the word biohack as I we were talking about again earlier because it the hack in my mind is something that is designed for one purpose that's used for another it's not the most efficient use of that tool nor is it naturally the best solution whereas biology has some very good solutions but they don't always work not every time I earlier today we did a practice in which which involved invasion shall we say of peri personal space we weren't standing super close for any original reason but there was God forbid but we but there was we were close enough together we could touch one torsos and we were doing that as part of this practice and you encourage me to pay attention to you know how does it feel to have someone in your peri personal space and then this notion of reactivity I find this in immensely interesting and potentially powerful practice because I think a lot of people I know a lot of people suffer from anxiety just being in a face-to-face conversation some people have a lot of anxiety about being physically close to people whether or not they know them or not and many people are reactive they are in that anticipatory state or something it's going to happen and sometimes it's relates to trauma and negative experience but sometimes no sometimes they're just not used to being in dynamic excuse me it exchange with other beings and so one thing that I love about the movement practice and how dynamic is that one can explore that space maybe you could talk about that a little bit more yeah touch proximity all these things also taking very it takes a very I think limited place in our lives people are not touched and they don't touch enough there are certain bubbles of peri personal space according to culture according to environment what is right what is wrong and then came all the of course politically correctness and her respins and all kinds and this is a problem it's a problem to navigate all this scenario and I think we are there there is definitely this side which is suffering people go to BJJ classes to touch not to learn BJJ the most of it they're not even aware of it before they would go to a prostitute maybe it would not be honest to say that yeah this is not required of unnecessary more in our lives children who are not touched there is a lot of information about that and the problems but adults who are not touched there is not a lot of information and I think it's no less of a problem because something that has to be constantly present and then proximity being able to as you said remove certain reactivity and to learn to control that volume control over how reactive I am and in other scenarios how do I remove this reactivity altogether is very important for performance and also for our lives for clear thinking etc because everything is moving through us and is being monitored by us so everything has the potential to detract us from a certain direction of exploration or if you're reactive you're a slave it becomes worse and worse and worse or as for example a fighter or a football player etc has to know what to take what not to take the fact that you can sense more does mean you should react to it and the practice helps that by bringing people into these scenarios but oftentimes disarming them like when we were working closely today and because you have a certain background with boxing or fighting I can tell you you are missing some kind of a way to be in that space that is not martial so you carry a certain tone although you're very kind person but oftentimes you help me without realizing you're holding me with a lot of strength for example and it was clear to me you're not fully aware of what is unfolding and it's just of course a question of experience so to be able to be in this scenario but do something else which is not geared towards winning losing competition or just being able to play with another person like for example contacting improvisation took that and played with that and the work of Steve Paxton for the ones who are not familiar so this is where I call it the the high bridge become very useful like we we don't when you are practicing in this open way you are not bound by specific rules set or ways of doing things it can be a fight but it can be a dance a moment after another thing that I learned from Kapoela the situation is very tricky there because I've seen kids doing cartwheels in Brazil and and scissors fall from their pockets why would you go to with a scissors in your pocket obviously there is certain intentions and then at other times you see backflips and beautiful things but people die in Kapoela every year that breaks or something kicks to the face from various violence it's I explored other martial arts and boxing I was involved with MMA and BJJ but I tell you the most violent arena is that why because it's unknown one moment it smiles another moment it's something else and it's uncontrolled there is no categories no weights and it's a street phenomenon so you have musical instruments sometimes they break it on your head people don't see that but you can look online on YouTube and see some of that side of Kapoela which is actually the day-to-day in Brazil and the reality and how things unfolded so it's very important to explore many ways of being within different distances and spaces from other people and touched in different ways and not contextualizing it always in the same way I can touch your chest in one way I can touch it with the exact same pressure and speed by will feel very different the parameters I'm not sure certain intentions certain combination of postures or ways and this is beautiful exploration and again I would encourage you and others to explore the discomfort for example certain discomfort to be with a many certain scenario or with a woman and trying to see what is that because if we're truly strong we are not afraid of anything if we truly know who we are and we are in that exploration we don't know the end result but we are in a research and then we are not afraid of being in that or this or and we don't come out of boundaries and this will improve our culture tremendously of course there must be agreement you never force yourself but you meet someone who is also interested in that exploration and then you do it and there are many scenarios to do that with traditional practices like learning to grapple or or going to contact improvisation and studying there or going to dance to to let in dance class or and there is of course my favorite is to create and to come up with your own hybrids of that and scenarios communicating with your loved one through movement not sitting around food and talking moving together in all kinds of ways sometimes it's walking together that sometimes it's all kinds of it can be game playful it can be romantic and there are many shades sex doesn't start here and here right it's like it's a continuum and we don't even need to define it in that way so with time I think it unlocks a lot of things people become much stronger in a good sense in sense of becoming being and we abuse less and we can approach yeah other aspects to us I love the idea that through the exploration of a range of physical context provided one knows they can always return to their center so to speak then there's a lot of opportunity that opens up I wish there was more of that encouraged in children's play but also as you mentioned in in adult environments because nowadays for all sorts of reasons that you've touched on you had you of keeping at least enormously distance has become critical there are a lot of environments actually where hugging is not allowed I don't know what it's like in Israel but in the states many institutions here you're not allowed to touch anyone else's body there's actually a wonderful study that comes to my from and Israeli laboratory I got him no msobl over there who is shown that by recording in people's first interactions that when people meet if they shake hands they almost always I think it's greater than 85% of the time they will then wipe the chemicals from the other person onto their own eyes typically their eyes or their face this change a little bit during the whole pandemic thing but this is thought to be a carryover from what other animals do in terms of exchanging microbiome elements exchanging chemicals that were constantly feeding our subconscious with the chemical knowledge of the chemical constituents of other people right so it goes way beyond how people smell how they look etc more touch seems to me just as you said provided it's consensual seems like it just a really good thing overall and say I think maybe also important for this charging this charging certain experiences remodeling reframing so it's like touches very powerful in that if you're touching and you're touching a lot you're you're unpacking and you experience that touch that maybe has been traumatic and you were reframing it you have the opportunity which is something interesting I've I've heard some story about some traditional culture in which when you were burned by mistake they would immediately burn you again and it made me think and then there would not be any burn marks and there would not be the same side effects that's the claim it made me think it's like what's the source of this and I I realized that maybe it allows a certain completion to happen that in the traumatic moment is not there so the re-exposure while you're still open the pores are still open allows you to reframe the experience and then the unfolding of the rest of the event is very different this is if you're touching in your practicing the day today and you're working with people and you're being touched and people come closer further away it happens naturally and yeah and if you test a certain limit and it becomes too much there is always of course communication that has to be present certain cultures make this communication pre certain cultures post they is really for example post here pre so in Israel they'll say that didn't feel good to me or that felt good or that was fine yeah it would be more common here in the airport the guys tell me I'm going to slide my hands up towards your crotch until I meet a hard stop and then he does this in a way that is supposed to show me I have no enjoyment in that and for me it just feels aggressive but his intention is good showing me but if it was a loving touch it would be nicer for me actually personally that's it would be gentle but he goes up there and he shows me I have no enjoyment in this but oh that's my testicle right there so it's it's it's different choices I don't think it's like worse but this description can be a bit dissociated and what does it make me think is it truly what he feels or not because he feels robotic so it's not so sometimes I rather not say it and I'm going to touch your chest I'm just place my head on the chest and of course we can't avoid the problem I'm not suggesting that there is but there is an examination and because I moved around around the world I've seen many things and I've seen benefits here benefits there and in the practice I think it's important to discuss this to examine this I don't have a solution but it's something to talk about it is something to talk about and I'm glad you raised it because I think that it's so clear to me that much of the value of a movement practice involves this dynamic interaction with somebody else as you point out it can be performed on one's own and practice throughout one's day but the unpredictability is a key element to all of it and and bringing out all the the potential that you've described in reference to the this notion of trauma and burn and reburn my colleague at Stanford David's beagle he's works on trauma and he's a has actually on this podcast he voiced that he's against things like trigger warnings because of the way that it puts the nervous system into the state of readiness and reactivity that can exacerbate problems whereas it's very clear from the literature on trauma and trauma relief that the way to deal with that is through a controlled but clearly a controlled re-exposure to the trauma in order to diminish the emotional response over time I mean it's very clear if we avoid the thing obviously we don't want to re-indger ourselves or retraumatize but if one avoids the thing that makes them upset over and over all it does is serve to create a heightened state of readiness it primes more trauma so I think it makes good sense I think impressions are very useful here also when stepping into an area in which trauma can occur and then by going through the impression that it already occurred you create some kind of a thermal layer of protection and so I've already been hit when I'm entering that space it's so beneficial or I've already been touched in a way that I didn't like if I go to a contact improvisation class and just running this scenario in your head protects so well yeah glad you mentioned running scenarios in your head I've been curious all day as to whether or not you do visualization or mental rehearsal of physical movement this is a it seems to be a popular idea in in the states people are always asking me you know can you just imagine a movement and learn it better than where you to actually perform it my hunch based on and my understanding the scientific literature is that visualization can be useful to some extent for people that are very good at visualization but for many people it doesn't help and that there's nothing like real physical practice to improve physical practice yeah the word visualizations not good obviously it has to be experientialization in a very complete way not just visually often come words and unless you already developed certain experience tangible experience that has been that has benefited from feedback from outside feedback it is not very useful thing to do and it ends up being fabrications but if you're very experienced and you already gained the benefit of being burnt here or overextended here then you have a certain experience and then you can strengthen certain aspect of it but you gotta be careful because you do not have feedback and because of the missing feedback you might develop delusions it might be that you develop a stronger patterning but ultimately this would lead you away from the aliveness of the movement itself drilling for example very useful to learn a general infrastructure of the movement sleeve or the technique but then to dress it up you need feedback you need it to be alive you need to receive something corrective I love it for many people the approach movement in the form of weight training or yoga running yoga is a bit more dynamic but it fairly linear types of exercise and movement peloton rolling it's kinds of things I think most people will probably not depart from those practices entirely because they like them I'm speaking about myself I like some of those very much I enjoy them but in terms of thinking about adding a movement practice to ones already existing exercise regime I can imagine threading it throughout the day I can imagine having a dedicated movement practice one thing that I have started doing on the basis of some of your teachings and I just created this idea rather than statically standing there and lifting weights actually walking from as I alternate repetitions it occurred to me then I'd never done a curl a bicep curl with one foot in front of the other and then I'd never actually switch that up and it's kind of an odd stance to be standing in parallel and curling one's arm is kind of a ridiculous movement when one thinks about it so I started incorporating something that you get some strange looks in the gym but I just give them strange looks back so what are your thoughts about these very linear forms of exercise and and do you encourage people to expand the place space as it were for these kinds of exercise or do you think that movement practice is just best explored through three-dimensionality gravity and maybe a sticker robot and it's definitely a problem and it's approachable people want to quick people want to heck people want the the icing there is no cake there is no cake and just like in the streets of icing icing icing on what what are you putting it on so for me that that's why I'm I'm going towards this side it's like I have my life now tell me what movement practices I should pursue you are movement in essence you are not thinking of yourself in any serious way in through my eyes there is a dynamic entity to you the body is a huge part of it communicating you have genetic layers there is a personality that got developed and built around various influences but then there is also some kind of an essence something that ricks from within the cells and if you grew up in my family and I grew up in your family and it would still be the same and something that I always try to think about what is that inside of me so I think this practices they're very good but they're not designed for the gold we think they were designed to it's orient towards something else for example yoga there is a good book called the yoga body which will destroy a lot of people the yoga practice and it goes into how did we get to this yoga the influence of Swedish gymnastics and Mongolian contortionists and the western the west effecting it and then the ancient practice which was barely asana related posture position so actually you said yoga is less linear yoga is very linear very linear these days these lines look at all the traditional dances they look like nothing like yoga look at tie dance look at Chinese dances martial arts so around it so it's like then like out nature what you see nature and the movement of the animals so where does it come from these are things to understand because it designs you now it shapes you you're placing yourself in these forces of change and these streams of change and you have a good intention you just want this or that but the joke is on us and this is the movement practice for me is first education let's start to think about this I have nothing that I can just sprinkle now some magic powder that will help resolve this because it's a start of a deep investigation and then some of the things let's talk pragmatically because what you described is not about you placing the foot in front when you're curling it's about the ex-emination this is why it is a very good direction and then you will need another one another one don't get stuck on that foot in front of it and try to do with the ice closed or with a different head posture and you will see things arrive unrelated things because the associative mind the thinking this relates this doesn't get to the heart we've never so just infusing these elements like in a cup will create endless combinations possibilities and a lot of discovery and this for me is humility of the practitioner I don't know I try like today with you I tried various combinations and oh I discovered something all this is a playful approach and this is a researcher approach and I don't try to fit my truth into something I'm there to examine I don't have a motive yet why because I'm fine I don't depend on that to define myself I'm a human being but if I don't have that sense of I'm already like geared towards I need to do this I need to prove this I have this agenda and this is how we get all the lies in the world and all the problems and difficulties so these practices they are related to it to prove this that this way why we need muscles for x-y-z and a lot of the reported outcomes are often from my places like funny I hear about something like I heard you say about gratitude practice that actually experience it from outside as if somebody else or you are receiving gratitude is actually more powerful it's true but I see whites through I'm not sure everybody says if somebody tries to feel gratitude just sit with the eyes closed or watch a movie and sense the gratitude there it would be clear to you one is very difficult to do and the others very easy hence if gratitude is achieved easier this way that's why it works like that although all the traditional practices are about you and by challenging yourself to sense that gratitude yourself they achieve much more powerful thing but this is not the research people the people in the research we don't have a lot of those people so a lot of the things that are can arrive to us way training the benefits or the way the the hormonal effects the effect over cognition etc I when you open a bit and you go far out you see certain things not the truth but maybe less delusion there is nothing definite but there is there is something maybe more wholesome that appears yeah I think this is so this is a state state of exploration I don't want to have the same thought if I already had it I would I want to have the same thought I already had it I don't want to have the same practice I don't want to I curled already in this way I want to experience something else I want to there is a benefit to gain no but that was better the better is better is not more is not faster is better is better and better isn't we don't know what better is right so it's like it's open oh this is better I don't know it's just more weight it's one more kilo but maybe if I remove one kilo I discover something like for example power development that has been shown to gain certain benefits when you lighten the load and you accelerate it more in certain conditions but who discovered it a practitioner and met person not the percussion skis at the or ski they reported something but it was already within the grasp of the practitioners and I think and as a researcher this is very powerful to remind yourself this and to work with that and as a practitioner as a living human being for everyone I think something very useful and then those plays that you're doing it people give you the the weird looks and it's like yeah I tell people you don't want to be normal if you don't get the weird looks you're not moving in the right direction you're moving in and in a very fixed and you already know the result of that direction let's say at least that so continue to play with that the continue to play look elsewhere look at places you didn't look at because this is still like within the same layer one foot in front one foot behind what happens when you do it with a smile the same workout and when you do it with a frown or what happens breath holding or blather stretches all this is great play and I think very beneficial to do to go through of it I think it's a wonderful message what I keep hearing from you over and over again is to that people should explore explore explore and listen I I want to thank you for your time today first of all for the incredible teachings here at this table but also the introduction to a movement practice although now I'm tempted to say that I've been moving my whole life I've just said it's true I was that it was such a vast landscape also that you're willingness to tread out in this journey that is truly unique you know that the greatest complement that one can give in science is the one that I'm going to tell you now because it's entirely appropriate which is we say you're in N of 1 right that that and you truly are I don't think there's anyone that has been as willing to embrace existing practices evolve them create new practices and and to share so broadly to really be willing to give and teach so much knowledge you know earlier you made the mention of your your goals of in part of being wild and wise and I'm here to tell you that you are both wild and wise and so thank you so much thank you very much thank you thank you for joining me today for my discussion about the science and practice of movement and movement culture with Edo Portal if

vid00012," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are going to discuss the science and practice of flexibility and stretching. Flexibility and stretching are topics that I believe do not receive nearly as much attention as they deserve. For most people, the topics of flexibility and stretching bring to mind things like yoga, injury prevention, or maybe even contortionism. But it turns out that flexibility and stretching are features that are built into our basic body plan. Young children, young animals and adults, and indeed older children and animals all stretch and all have some degree of flexibility. It turns out that having flexibility and our ability to stretch and the interaction between stretching and flexibility are fundamental to how we move our ability to learn new movements. Indeed, also to prevent injury, will repair injuries and to offsetting and reducing inflammation throughout the body. In fact, today I'm going to share with you a remarkable set of studies that show that stretching can actually adjust things like tumor growth. This is work that was done by one of the major directors of the National Institutes of Health. So today's discussion will start with a description of the mechanisms, literally the cells and the connections from your nervous system that mediate flexibility and stretching. And I promise that I'll make that information accessible to you, whether or not you have a biology background or not. Then with that information in hand, I'm going to present to you what the scientific literature says about the best times and ways to stretch. Everything right down to the detail of how long to hold a stretch whether or not to hold a stretch at all because it turns out there are multiple kinds of stretching. So you can imagine you have stretches where you hold the stretch for a very long time and use as little momentum as possible. And then there's also what's called dynamic and ballistic stretching where you're literally swinging your limbs trying to increase the range of motion. I will explain the science and application of flexibility and stretching in the context of sports performance, whether or not you're engaging in cardiovascular exercise or resistance exercise or. Both whether you're competitive athlete or simply a recreational exercise or as I am. Whether or not you are trying to increase your range of motion and flexibility for longevity purposes or whether or not you're trying to do it. In order to access different parts of your nervous system because we'll soon learn today that your ability to improve flexibility and. The two engage in specific stretching exercises can actually be used to powerfully modulate your ability to tolerate pain both emotional and physical pain. So this thing that we call flexibility and stretching is actually a vast landscape. We're going to simplify and organize all that for you today and by the end of today's episode you're going to have a number of simple easy to apply tools that are grounded in the best scientific research that you can apply for your specific goals. Before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rules it's Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is thesis thesis makes custom new tropics that are designed to get your brain and body into the optimal state for the cognitive and physical things that you need to perform at the highest level. I have to confess in fact I've said it many times before I'm not a fan of the word new tropics because it means smart drugs and frankly as a neuroscience test. I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that there's really no circling your brain for being smart you have neural circuits in your brain that are designed to get you to focus very well or to tasks which very well or to be creative. thesis understands this and as a consequence they've designed new tropics that are tailored to your specific needs in the cognitive and physical realm. What I mean by that is if you go to the thesis site you fill out a short quiz and they'll give you the opportunity to try a small kit of different new tropics with different ingredients. You have the opportunity to try several different blends over the course of the month and discover which new tropics were best for your unique brain chemistry and genetics. I've been using thesis for about eight and a half months now and I can confidently say that their new tropics have been a game changer. To get your own personalizing new tropic starter kit you can go online to takethesis.com slash human. There you'll find that three minute quiz and thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month.

Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood test and DNA tests out there is that you get information back about hormone levels metabolic factors etc. But you don't know what to do with that information. Inside Tracker has a very easy to use personalized platform that lets you look at those numbers and then you can literally move your cursor over those numbers and or pop up windows that will tell you the things that you can do in terms of lifestyle, exercise and nutrition supplementation and so on to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you. So it really takes all the guesswork out of what to do with that blood work and DNA information.

Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 sleep. 8 sleep makes smart mattress covers that have cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity. And indeed you can dial in, you can literally program the temperature of your sleeping environment from the time you go to sleep until the time you wake up in the morning. This turns out to be immensely powerful because as I've talked about on the podcast before in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, your body has to drop by about 1-3 degrees and waking up in the morning actually involves a warming up of your body temperature. For many people, they just can't precisely control their sleep environment well enough in order for all that to go well. I was one such person so for a long time I'd fall asleep pretty easily, but then I'd wake up in the middle of the night. I tended to run warm but then sometimes I'd feel really tired in the morning as if I couldn't wake up. I started sleeping on an 8 sleep mattress cover. I programmed it so that the temperature would be rather cool in the early part of the evening when I would get into bed and then would drop into the deeper phases of the night when I was entering. Deep sleep and then wrap it up. I moved my sleep in the warm, and it would wake up quickly. As a consequence, I'm sleeping throughout the night now and I'm waking up feeling completely refreshed. If you'd like to try an 8 sleep mattress cover, you can go to 8 sleep.com-thuberman to check out the pro pod cover and save $150 at checkout. 8 sleep currently ships within the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

Before we talk about the practices of flexibility and stretching, I'd like to just highlight some of the features that are already built into your nervous system and into your body that allow you to be flexible. Some of us feel tighter than others, sometimes in specific limbs or areas of our body. Some people feel really loose and limber. Some people even have what's called a hyper flexibility. I, for instance, have a relative that can take her fingers and bend them back to the point where they touch her wrist and it always makes me cringe a little bit. But she can do that without any pain. She seems to have some hyper flexibility in her joints. I do not have that feature. Some of you may find that you are more flexible than others naturally. And some of you might be thinking, you don't need to build in additional flexibility. Well, I think by the end of today's episode, you'll realize that almost all of us can benefit from having some sort of understanding about flexibility and having some stretching protocol that we incorporate into our life. If not just for physical performance reasons and for postural reasons, then also for cognitive and mental reasons. I'll be sure to clarify what all of that means. Right now I'd like to take a moment and just highlight the flexibility that you already have. For instance, if you were to move your arm behind your torso a little bit and then sort of let go or stop exerting any effort in doing that, you would find that the limb would return more or less to a position next to your torso, at least I would hope so. And why is that? Well, it turns out that there are aspects of your nervous system, aspects of your skeletal system, aspects of your muscles, and aspects of the connective tissue that binds all of that together, that trying to restore a particular order or position to your limbs and your limbs relative to one another. So that reflects a very specific set of processes that it turns out are the same set of processes that you use when you are trying to enhance flexibility and stretching. So I'd like to just take a moment and review the basic elements of nervous system, muscle, connective tissue and skeletal tissue, bone that allow for flexibility and stretching. And here we can point to two major mechanisms by which your nervous system neurons, meaning nerve cells, communicate with muscles and those muscles communicate back to your nervous system to make sure that your limbs don't stretch too far, they don't move too far such that you get injured. And in addition to that, mechanisms that ensure that you don't overload your muscles too much with weight or with tension or with effort and damage them that way. Because it turns out that the second security mechanism of making sure that you don't overload muscles can be leveraged toward increasing your flexibility almost immediately. That's right, there are protocols and tools that I'll share with you that are going to allow you to vastly improve your flexibility over time, but there are also mechanisms that allow you to quite significantly increase your degree of flexibility in a very short period of time within just a few seconds. So let's establish some of the basic biological mechanisms. And time we talk about biology or physiology, we're going to talk about structure, meaning the cells and their connections and functions what they do. There are just a few names to understand, you do not have to memorize these names. The important thing that I'd like you to know is that flexibility and the process of stretching and getting more flexible involves three major components. Neural meaning of the nervous system, muscular muscles, and connective tissue. Connective tissues, the stuff that surrounds the neural stuff and the muscular stuff, although it's all kind of weave together and braided together in complicated ways. Some of you may have heard of fascia, we're going to talk a little bit about fascia today, although it's such an interesting tissue that's really deserving of its own episode. Facial tissue, we're going to talk about some of the stuff that surrounds the muscles that really gives you your shape and holds everything together and allows for flexibility to occur. So here's a key thing that everyone should know whether or not you're talking about flexibility or not. Your nervous system controls your muscles. It's what gets your muscles to contract. So within your spinal cord, you have a category of neurons nerve cells that are called motor neurons to be precise. They are lower motor neurons because they're in your spinal cord. We call them lower to distinguish them from the motor neurons that are in your brain up in your skull. Those lower motor neurons, here after I'll just refer to them as motor neurons. If I want to talk about the other kind of motor neurons, I'll say upper motor neurons. I just mean the ones in your spinal cord. Those motor neurons send a little wire or set of wires out to your muscles. And that creates what's called a neuromuscular junction, which just means that the neurons meet the muscles that are particular place. Those neurons release a chemical. That chemical is called acetylcholine. Some of you may have heard about acetylcholine before. Acetylcholine also exists in your brain and does other things in your brain. Mainly, it's involved in focus and attention. But at the neuromuscular junction, the release of acetylcholine from these nerve cells, these neurons, onto the muscles, causes the muscles to contract. And when muscles contract, they are able to move limbs by way of changing the length of the muscle, adjusting the function of connective tissue, like tendons and ligaments. For instance, if you're bringing your wrist closer to your shoulder, that biceps muscle is contracting. It's getting shorter. I mean, in reality it hasn't gotten shorter overall. It's just temporarily shorter, of course. All of that is controlled by neurons. And it's those motor neurons from the spinal cord that are really responsible for the major movement of your limbs by way of causing contraction of specific muscles at specific times. So the key thing to take away is that nerve could control the contraction of muscles. Now, within the muscles themselves, there are nerve connections. And these are nerve connections that arise from a different set of neurons in the spinal cord that we call sensory neurons. The sensory neurons exist in a different part of the spinal cord, and they send a low wire or set of wires into the muscles. And there's a particular kind of sensory neuron that comes out of your spinal cord and into your muscles, which are called spindle neurons. They create or they actually wrap around muscle fibers. And a corkscrew around them, and give kind of a spring like appearance. If for you, aficionados out there, these are intrafusal connections or neurons intrafusal means within the muscle. But you really don't need to know that unless you're really curious about it, and become a neuroscience tester, you're in medical school or something, these spindle connections within the muscle that wrap around the muscle fibers, sense the stretch of those muscle fibers. So now we have two parts to the system that I've described. You've got motor neurons that can cause muscles to contract and shorten, and we have these spindles within the muscles themselves, that wrap around the muscle fibers, and that information is sent from the muscle back to the spinal cord. It's a form of sensing what's going on in the muscle. Much in the same way that you have neurons in your eye that sense light in your external environment. You have neurons in your ear that sense sound waves in your external environment. You have neurons in your spinal cord that are sensory neurons that are sensing the amount of stretch in the muscles. What happens is if a given muscle is stretching really far, those sensory neurons, those spindles within the muscle, will activate and will send a electrical potential, literally, a bit of electricity along that wire's length, into the spinal cord. And then within the spinal cord, that sensory neuron communicates through a series of intermediate steps, but to the motor neuron and make sure that that motor neuron contracts. Why would that be useful? Well, what this does is it creates a situation where if a muscle is stretching too much, because the range of motion of a limb is increased too much, then the muscle will contract to bring that limb range of motion into a safe range again. Now, what determines whether or not a range of motion is, quote, unquote, safe or not, is dictated by a number of things. It's dictated by things that are happening in this kind of loop of neural connections in the spinal cord and muscle. It's also determined by what's going on in your head, literally in your mind, cognitively, about whether or not the movement of that limb. It's increasing range of motion is good for you, whether or not you're doing it deliberately, whether or not it's bad for you. And then there are also some basic safety mechanisms that are put in there that really try and restrict our limb range of motion. Okay, so just to clarify, this whole thing looks like a loop and the essential components of the loop are motor neurons contract muscles. Sensory neurons of which there are a bunch of different varieties, in this case, what we're calling the spindles are sensing stretch within the muscles. And if a given muscle is elongating because of the increased range of motion of a limb, those sensory neurons send an electrical signal into the spinal cord, such that there is an activation of the motor neuron which by now should make perfect sense as to why that's useful. It then shortens up the muscle, it actually doesn't really shorten the muscle, but contracts the muscle that brings the limb back into a safe range of motion. Okay, so this process is very fast. It was designed to keep your body together and safe. It's designed to make sure that you don't take your arm and swing it behind your torso and it just goes all the way back to the middle of your back. And unless you're a contortionist, you've trained that kind of level of flexibility that would be terrible because it could provide a lot of damage to the muscles and to the connective tissue and so forth. So that's one basic mechanism that we want to hold in mind. This idea of a spindle that senses stretch and can activate contraction of the muscles and shorten the muscles. Next mechanism I want to describe and once again, there are only two that you need to hold in mind for this episode. This other mechanism has a lot of the same features as the one I just described, but it has less to do with stretch. In fact, it doesn't have to do with stretch as much as it has to do with sensing loads. So at the end of each muscles, you have tendons typically. There are neurons that are closely associated with those tendons that are called Golgi tendon organs, right? These are neurons that are sensory neurons that sense how much load is on a given muscle, right? So if you're lifting up something very, very heavy, these neurons are going to fire, meaning they're going to send electrical activity into the spinal cord. And then those neurons have the ability to shut down, not activate, but shut down, motor neurons, and to prevent the contraction of a given muscle. So for instance, if you were to walk over and try and pick up a weight that is much too heavy for you, meaning you could not do it without injuring yourself. And you start to try and keep that weight off the ground. There are a number of reasons why you might not be able to lift it, but let's say you start to get a little bit off the ground or you start to get some some force generated that would allow it to move. But the force that you're generating could potentially rip your muscles or your tendons off of the bone, right? That it could disrupt the joints and it could tear ligaments. Well, you have a safety mechanism in place. These Golgi tendon organs, these GTOs, as they're called, that get activated and shut down the motor neurons and make it impossible for those muscles to contract. So on the one hand, we have a mechanism that senses stretch and can figure out when stretch is excessive and when the system detects that stretch is excessive. It activates the contraction of muscles. And then we have a second mechanism that senses loads and when tension or loads is deemed excessive by these circuits. And remember these circuits don't have a mind, they don't go, this is excessive. They just sense loads and when those loads exceed a certain threshold. Well, then those GTOs, as Golgi tendon organs, send signals into the spinal cord that shut down your motor neurons ability to contract muscle so that you no longer can lift that heavy load. So both of these are protective mechanisms, but both of these can be leveraged in a very logical way and in a very safe way in order to increase your limb range of motion. So there are a couple of things I want to point out before going a little bit further into how your nervous system controls flexibility and stretching. And those key points are the following. There are now dozens, if not hundreds of studies, that show that a dedicated stretching practice can improve limb range of motion. Now, for many of you listening, you're probably saying, duh, but I think it's important to point that out that a dedicated stretching practice can increase limb range of motion. And as you'll soon learn, there are specific mechanisms that can explain that effect. The second point is one of longevity. And when I say longevity, I don't necessarily mean late stage aging. We all undergo a decrease in limb range of motion unless we do something to offset that decrease. And the current number is very from study a study, but if you look and mass, you look at all of those studies and what you basically find is that we start to experience a decrease in flexibility from about age 20 until about age 49 that's pretty dramatic. And then of course it will continue after age 49. But basically it's a 10% decrease every 10 years. So we could say it's a 1% decrease per year, although it's not necessarily linear. What do I mean by that? Well, it's not necessarily that on your 21st birthday. You are 1% less flexible than you were on your 20th birthday and that decrease by 1% per year. Some of these changes can be non-linear. So you can imagine the person who's doing just fine in terms of flexibility between 20 and 30. And then you know, they get to 32 and suddenly they've lost 5% of their flexibility. Now, of course there will be a ton of lifestyle factors. If you're a regular practitioner of yoga, if you have a dedicated stretching practice, if you're doing other things to improve your muscle contractabilities, you're doing resistance training. It turns out can actually indirectly improve flexibility. There are a number of different factors. But the key point is that maintaining some degree of flexibility, and maybe even enhancing range of motion and flexibility, is of immense benefit for offsetting injury. Provided it's not pushed too far. There are a number of people who have pushed their limb range of motion so far that they experience all sorts of injuries both acute and chronic injuries. Today we'll also talk about how to avoid those scenarios. Okay, so we've established that there are mechanisms within the spinal cord, muscles, and connective tissue. Those remember it's the motor neurons, the spindles, the GTOs, and of course the muscles themselves, and connective tissue, tendons, but also other forms of connective tissue. That established whether or not a limb is going to stay within a particular range of motion or not, whether or not a limb is going to be allowed by the nervous system to pursue or handle a given load, a given tension. There are also mechanisms that arrive to the neuromuscular system from higher up in the nervous system, from the brain. And those mechanisms involve a couple of different facets that are really interesting, and I think that we should all know about. In fact, today I'm going to teach you about a set of neurons that I'm guessing 99.9% of you have never heard of, including all you neuroscientists out there, if you're out there. And I know you're out there, that seem uniquely enriched in humans and probably perform essential roles in our ability to regulate our physiology and our emotional state. So within the brain we have the ability to sense things in the external world, something we call exteroception, and we have the ability to sense things in our internal world within our body called interoception. Interoception can be the volume of food in your gut, whether or not you're experiencing any organ pain or discomfort, whether or not you feel good in your gut and in your organs. That's actually a kind of feeling, you know, you're mad, you're great, I feel say it, I feel relaxed, those are all different forms of interoception. The main brain area that's associated with interpreting what's going on in our body is called the insula, INSULA, it's a very interesting brain region, it's got two major parts, the front of it is mainly concerned with things like smell and to some extent, vision and to some extent. Other things that are arriving from the external world and combining with what's going on internally and making sense of that of all that, or at least routing that information elsewhere in your nervous system to make decision, like if you smell something good to approach it, or if you smell something bad to avoid it. The front of the insula is really doing all of that kind of stuff, along with other brain areas. The posterior insula, the back of the insula that is has a very interesting and distinct set of functions. The posterior insula is mainly concerned with what's going on with your somatic experience. How do you feel internally and how is the movement that you happen to be doing, combining with your internal state to allow you to feel as I like to say the nervous system, mainly batches things into yum, like oh this is really good for me, yuck this is really bad for me, and I need to stop or meh, this is kind of neutral. So this isn't about food, but we could say for most stimuli, most senses, whether or not their senses of things internally or externally, our nervous system is trying to make decisions about what to do with that information, and so it mainly batches information into yum. I want to keep doing this or approach this thing or continue down some path of movement or eating or staying in a temperature environment, etc. Or yuck, I need to get out of here, I don't want any more of this, I don't want to keep doing this, this is painful or reversive or stressful, and then meh. So it doesn't really matter, I can just stay right here or we're not. Yum, yuck and meh. Well, in your posterior insula, you have a very interesting population of very large neurons, these are exceptionally large neurons, called van-economon neurons. These are neurons that are, again, unbeknownst to most neuroscientists, and they seem uniquely enriched in humans. chimpanzees have them and some other large animals have them, so they're found in whales, chimpanzees, elephants, and in humans. But even though we are much smaller than most whales, and even though we are much smaller than most elephants, I mean, remember there are baby elephants, as far as I know they haven't bred up, like many elephants yet, they seem to have a teacup version of pretty much every dog breed. You can look that up, I certainly have mixed feelings about this notion of trying to downsize everything to the point where you could kind of like the pocket-sized bulldog, I think, of some day will arrive, I'm not a fan of that kind of downsizing of different breeds, but because there aren't teacup elephants and teacup gorillas and teacup chimpanzees and so forth, most of those other species are larger than us, they have these van-economon neurons, and we have these van-economon neurons, but we have in upwards of 80,000 of these things in our poster in slut. These other species tend to have somewhere in the range of 1,000 to maybe 10,000 or so. Why is that interesting? Well, these van-economon neurons have the unique property of integrating our knowledge about our body movements, our sense of pain and discomfort, and can drive motivational processes that allow us to lean into discomfort and indeed to overcome any discomfort, if we decide that the discomfort that we are experiencing is good for us or directed toward a specific goal. This knowledge turns out to be very important to keep in mind because as we migrate this conversation toward the things that we can do to enhance flexibility and stretching, you'll soon learn that there are moments within a stretching protocol where you have the opportunity to either override pain and discomfort. It's a kind of relaxed through it or push through it, there's a decision fork in the road there, and I'll tell you which fork in the road to take, or to say, ah, I'm not going to do that, I'm going to allow these natural reflexes of the spindle to kick in and just essentially stop me from stretching if a given limb isn't designed or shouldn't be stretched that far. So I'd like you to keep these van-economon neurons in mind. I should mention their named van-economon because the guy, Constantine van-economon, that discovered them at the end of the 1800s, early 1900s, decided to name them after himself as many scientists do, or certainly the neurologists and physicians are famous for naming things after themselves. These van-economon neurons turn out to be very important to keep in mind as we embark on our exploration of what sorts of stretching practices can be best applied to increase flexibility. Because whether or not you undertake a mild moderate or intense flexibility training, you will know doubt encounter a scenario at some point where you will have to ask yourself, do I, quote unquote, relax into this stretch or do I try and push through just a little bit of discomfort? And I'll explain how to gauge that decision in a very specific and ideally safe way. I don't give you some tools that will allow you to make that decision in the way that best preserves the integrity of those neural circuits that I described earlier and can keep you safe. These van-economon neurons sit in the exact position that one would want to be able to evaluate what's going on in the body, in particular what's going on in terms of limb movements, how that relate to our feelings of discomfort and then there's the other aspect of these van-economon neurons, which is that these van-economon neurons are connected to a number of different brain areas that can shift our internal state from one of so-called sympathetic activation. So this is a pattern of alertness and even stress, sometimes even panic, but typically alertness and stress, to one so-called parasympathetic activation, to one of relaxation. Oftentimes you'll hear that stretching should be done by relaxing into the stretch. But what does it actually mean to relax into the stretch? Well, these van-economon neurons sit at this junction where they're able to evaluate what's going on inside our body and allow us to access neural circuits by which we can shift our relative level of alertness down a bit, or our relative level of stress down a bit, and thereby to increase so-called parasympathetic activation, and to literally override some of those spindle mechanisms. Even the GTO mechanisms, but especially the spindle mechanisms at the neuromuscular and muscular spinal junction, and in that way, gently, subtly override the reflex that would otherwise cause us to contract those muscles back. The reason that's possible is because your brain has those other kinds of motor neurons, the upper motor neurons that can both direct meaning control and can override lower motor neurons. I'll give you a brief example of this that you've already done in your life and that we all have the capacity for. What I'm referring to is the monocinaptic stretch reflex. This is something that every first year neuroscience graduate student learns, which is that if you were to step on a sharp object with a bare foot, you would not need to make the decision to retract your foot. You would automatically do that, provided you have a healthy nervous system. There are mechanisms in place that cause the retraction of that limb by way of ensuring that the proper muscles contract, and other muscles do not contract, in fact, that they fully relax. So in the case of stepping on a sharp object, like a piece of glass or an nail or a tack, you would essentially activate the hip flexor to lift up your foot as quickly as possible. In doing so, that same neural circuit would activate a control-addle meaning opposite side of the body circuit to ensure that the leg of the foot that's not stepping on the sharp object would do exactly the opposite and would extend. To make sure that you don't fall over. All of that happens reflexively. It does not require any thought or decision making. In fact, humans without any neocortex, literally, they're who are disserabred, or an animal that doesn't have, and why I say disserabred, I mean lack of cerebral cortex. They can perform that because it's all controlled by circuits that are basically below the brain and in the spinal cord. There's a little bit of activation of circuits in the deeper parts of the brain, but basically you don't need to think or decide in order to do that. However, if your life depended on walking across some sharp objects, let's say let's make it a little less dramatic, so it's not like the diehard movie or something where you have to run barefoot across the glass. So that's a pretty good example of what I'm describing here. But let's say you had to walk across some very hot stones to get away from something that you wanted to avoid. You could override that stretch reflex by way of a decision made with your upper motor neurons, your insula and your cognition and almost certainly those vaniconomone neurons, which would be screaming, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, could shuttle that information to brain areas that would allow you to override the reflex and essentially push through the pain. And maybe even, in fact, even, not experience the pain to the same degree or even at all. So these vaniconomone neurons sit at a very important junction within the brain. They pay attention to what's going on in your body, pain, pleasure, et cetera, and that includes what's going on with your limbs and your limb range of motion. They also are paying attention and can control the amount of activation, kind of alertness or calmness that you are able to create within your body in response to a given sensory experience. And as I mentioned before, they seem to be uniquely enriched in humans. They seem to be related to the aspects of our evolution that allow us to make decisions about what to do with our body in ways that other animals just simply can't. Before we go any further, I want to give you a practical tool that you can, of course, use, but that will also give you insight and experience into your muscle spindle spinal cord circuit mechanisms. So what I'd like you to do is, if you're in a proper place to do this, you're going to stand with legs straight, meaning knees not bent, and you're going to try and touch your toes, or for some of you, that's going to be very easy, and you might even be able to put your hands flat on the floor. I don't have that kind of flexibility, it's pretty easy for me to touch my toes. I don't care if you round your back or not, although ideally I would say don't round your back, not because it's bad to do so necessarily, but just to try and keep this, the same from trial to trial as it were. So try and get a sense of what your range of motion is in terms of bending over. At the waist, while maintaining a flat back and trying to touch your toes, or even touch the floor, maybe again you can even go hands flat to the floor, maybe even far out in front of you. Okay, now what I'd like you to do is stand back up, and I'd like you to contract your quadriceps as hard as you possibly can for about five to 15 seconds. Let's say 10 seconds, just to keep things more or less normalized. This obviously is not a super controlled experiment. So to contract your quadriceps, for those of you that don't know, you're going to extend your lower limb out, so this would be like kicking, although don't do it too quickly, you're going to kick out your foot. You should feel your quadriceps contract on the top of your thighs, and you're going to try and consciously contract them as hard as you can. Okay, typically, if you want to point your toe back towards your near shin, that's also going to help somewhat to contract even harder and harder. Okay, so do that for about 10 seconds. A lot of you will do this just while standing, contract contract contract contract, okay, then release it, and then now go ahead and repeat that stretch where you're trying to touch your toes or touch the floor. So this is again relying more or less on hamstring flexibility among other things. Okay, what most of you will find is that you have an immediate increase in hamstring flexibility or your range of motion has increased. If you didn't experience that, then I would encourage you to try and contract your quadriceps harder and longer, so maybe 20 or 30 seconds, and then try this so called experiment again. Why would contracting your quadriceps allow your hamstring flexibility to suddenly increase? Well, the way that our muscles are organized is such that we have muscles that are antagonistic to one another. So our quadriceps and our hamstrings work in sort of a push pull fashion, if you will, they can antagonize one another. So when you move your heel towards your glutes, you are using your hamstring, the hamstring obviously also does other things relate to hip movement. And when you lift your knee, or when you extend your foot and contract your quadriceps, you are essentially relaxing the hamstrings. Of course, most movements involve both quadriceps and hamstring in synchrony and that synchrony is really an elegant one. But here we're more or less isolating the quadriceps from the hamstrings at least to the extent that it can leverage these spindle stretch mechanisms. So what happens is when you contract your quadriceps hard, you are relaxing or releasing some of the stretch that's occurring in those intrafusals spindle sensory fibers going into your spinal cord. And as a consequence, you're able then to stretch your hamstrings further, or we can be more accurate and say that your range of motion about the hamstring and it's related joints is greater. When you aren't engaging that spindle reflex, which would cause the hamstrings to contract. Okay, so if you are somebody who has tight hamstrings, there could be a variety of reasons for that. But part of the reason is likely to be neural, and you can release that neural spindle reflex by contracting the opposite antagonistic muscle, which in this case is the quadriceps. The same thing is true and can be leveraged for stretching other muscles. So for instance, if you're going to do a tricep stretch, the typical kind of overhead where you grab your elbow and move it toward the midline of your body with the other using your opposite hand. Well, you can do that, and then I would suggest trying to flex your bicep, contract your bicep that is while doing that. For most people, you'll notice a increase in the tricep range of motion or ability to kind of lean into or to relax into or to push that stretch, excuse me a little bit further. Now, for you physios out there and for those of you that have backgrounds in cannesiology, I want to acknowledge, of course, there are other mechanisms that are coming into play. Actually, neural connections within the joints themselves that are providing appropriate receptive feedback, et cetera, et cetera. But this is simply to illustrate that part of our range of motion is determined by the spindle mechanisms that I spent some time focusing on earlier. And indeed, this approach can be leveraged toward creating increased limb range of motion, not just for the hamstrings, but for your quadriceps. So for instance, if you have tight quadriceps, you can do the opposite. You can contract your hamstring very intensely for, let's say, 10 seconds or 20 seconds or 30 seconds. So that would take some conscious effort of bringing your heel up towards your glutes. You could do that in a way that you're really trying to contract those muscles hard. You'd have to use some deliberate hamstring activation there, meaning you have to use those upper motor neurons and the other aspects of your upper brain power as it were, to try and really. Contract your hamstring says intensely as possible, then you would relax that. And then you would do your quadriceps stretch again. And if you did a pre hamstring contraction measurement of your quadriceps, flexibility. And then you did a post hamstring contraction measure of your quadriceps flexibility. Almost certainly you would find that that flexibility had increased. Now, of course, the muscle really didn't change much. What changed was the patterns of neural activation that were restricting you from in the first case stretching your hamstring. We're having a to be more accurate. We should say, having a certain range of motion about the hamstring and it's related joints. And those break mechanisms were removed. And of course, then when you contract your hamstring, you're removing some of the neural breaks. The spindle acting as a break. And inhibiting that quadricep range of motion. Okay. So you can imagine this. And in fact, you can apply this for any number of different muscles. The larger muscles and the sort of biceps triceps and hamstrings quadriceps that are sort of the simplest place to think about this and to apply it. But in theory and indeed in practice, it really works for all the various muscle groups. It's just sometimes harder to access these so called antagonistic muscle groups. Now, we should take a moment and just discuss what actually happens is we get more flexible in the short term and long term. I just mentioned what happens in the short term. Clearly, those don't involve lengthening of the muscles. It's not like the muscles slide along the bones or that the tendons really stretch out that much more than they had prior to that kind of, you know, exercise. But it is the case that if people stretch consistently over a given period of several weeks or more, that there are changes in the muscles. This gets a little bit tricky in terms of nomenclature and I just want to highlight that because I think that a number of people get frustrated and confused in fact when we talk about muscles getting longer. You know, the whole concept of a muscle getting longer isn't really in keeping with reality, but there are elements within the muscles that can change their confirmation. So to get a little bit detailed here and we won't spend too much time on this, but I just want to acknowledge this for those of you that are interested in neuromuscular physiology and how it relates to flexibility. You know, you have your muscle fibers and then you have your so-called myophibrals. So you can imagine kind of a single fiber. That fiber, of course, will get input from those motor neurons. And then within those fibers, you have what are called sarcomeers. And you can kind of think about sarcomeers as little segments, kind of like the segments of bamboo. If you ever look at bamboo, it's not just one big stalk. It's got those little out pouchings along the way that kind of break up the. What would be just one big stalk of bamboo into different segments, but they're all connected. The sarcomeers are somewhat like that. And within the sarcomeers, you have a couple of different components. One thing is called myosin, which is like a thick layer. And then the others act in. And those are interdigitators, we say, they're kind of connected to one another kind of like if you were put your fingers together from your two hands. If you're, you know, put your fingers in between one another, that's interdigitator literally, interdigitator in this case. So pun intended. And that myosin and act in kind of move relative to one another and they have a lot to do with your ability to contract muscles. When we stretch muscles, when we go through a stretching practice, there are a number of things that change some neural, some related directly to connective tissue. But also it appears from really nice work mainly done from McGill University. I'll provide a link to a couple of these studies if you want to dig in there deeply. That change the confirmation, the relative size and spacing of some of these things like sarcomeers and the way that myosin and act in kind of work together. But we don't want to think of muscles as lengthening. We can, however, think about the resting state of a muscle being slightly different or indeed very different than the resting state of a muscle of somebody or of a limb that has not undergone regular flexibility training. So that's as much time as I want to spend on that because we could spend an entire hour getting right down into the details. But I do want to emphasize, however, that muscles have different parts, they have fibers, they have sarcomeers, they have myosin, they have acting. But the idea of making our muscles longer, that reflects a number of processes that occur basically within an existing muscle length. The length of our muscle bellies and where our insertions are relative to our connective tissue and our limbs is genetically determined. Right? Some people have, for instance, a bicep that goes all the way from the crookeded elbow up to their shoulder, right? And some people can, you know, if they would have put their arm in a 90 degree angle, could put two or three fingers between their bicep and their elbow, they have a, we can say, a shorter bicep, relatively shorter. Now, the reason I mention these highly detailed cellular mechanisms is because as we start to embark on different protocols for using stretching to increase flexibility and range of motion. We need to ask ourselves, what is preventing our ability to extend range of motion? Is it the spindle, right? Is it because the muscle is stretching too much? Oftentimes it can be because of that and or because of a sense of pain or simply a sense that the muscle is not in a position that it's been in before that's unrelated to pain or to spindle activation. And oftentimes it can be related directly to these changes in the confirmation of myocin and actin and within the context of the sarco-meers. Now, of course, you can't peer into or sense your individual sarco-meers. However, you do have neurons that innovate these areas and that send that sensory information back into the spinal cord and up to your brain to interpret. So you'll find that as we move along, there are specific adjustments that you can make at the both the macro level, meaning how much movement to insert into your stretching, right? Is it going to be a static or dynamic or even a ballistic stretch or, for instance, at the micro level that even just a slight sub-millimeter or millimeter increase in the stretching of a given muscle and it related tissues can translate into an increased range of motion performance. As a quick relevant aside, I thought I'd share with you something useful. That's also grounded in this notion of antagonistic muscles. So for those of you that do resistance training, whether or not to body weight or with physical weights or machines, what have you, you may have found that if you, let's say we're to do three sets of a pushing exercise. So this could be push ups. This could be bench presses. This could be shoulder presses, something of that sort. And then later in the workout you were to do, let's say machine pull downs or pull ups or chin ups of some sort, so a pulling exercise. Typically what you would find is if you were to do what's often called straight sets, so you would do three sets of push ups, let's say with two minutes of rest in between. That you might be able to get a certain number of repetitions on the first set. Just for sake of example, let's say you can get ten repetitions on the first set and then you get eight repetitions on the first set. And then you get eight repetitions on the second set and then you get six repetitions on the third set with two minutes in between. And then you would move on at some point to your pulling exercises and similarly, let's say you were doing chin ups or pull downs and you would get ten repetitions rest two minutes, eight repetitions rest two minutes and six repetitions. Okay fine. Well, typically what people discover is that if they interleave their pushing and pulling exercises, provided they do that for muscles that are antagonistic to one another. So in this case, pushing with the chest shoulders and triceps for the pushing exercises and pulling with the back and biceps and of course, their other muscles involved as well. But because those muscle groups are at least in part antagonistic to one another, what people often find is that if they were to say do their pushing set, get ten repetitions, then move to a pulling set after just say 60 seconds. And perform that pulling set, then go back to the pushing set, then go back to a pulling set, push pull, push pull, in other words interleaving their sets. Even if they were to maintain the same amount of rest between sets of pushing and sets of pulling, what they discover often is that the drop in the number of repetitions that they get is somewhat offset. So rather than get ten eight six as it were with the straight sets, it will be ten nine eight. So what this means is not that you're increasing the total rest time to four minutes between sets because then of course it wouldn't be equivalent. But rather that while maintaining the same amount of rest between sets for this same muscle group, by going from push pull, push pull of antagonistic muscles, you're able to have improved performance. And the reason for that has everything to do with what we were describing before, which is that typically, if you were to do push set, rest, push set, rest, push set, rest, well, in between those sets. And in fact, actually during those sets of pushing, the pulling muscles that would be involved in the chinups or pull downs, et cetera are actually relaxing or at least are being released of some tension, including the activation of the spindles, among other things. So that's a long-winded way of saying that interleaving push and pull of antagonistic sets can leverage some of the same neural circuits that we're talking about leveraging for sake of increasing flexibility. Now I offer this to you as a tool that you can try. One of the challenges with using this tool, however, is that you often have to occupy multiple sites within the gym. If you're doing this at home and you have your own gym, that's one thing. If you're doing this in a gym where you have multiple pieces of equipment, then you become that person who has essentially taken over some small corner or multiple corners or machines within the gym. And oftentimes you'll find that you'll walk back to a machine or you'll walk back to a given resistance exercise and someone has now taken it over and the whole thing can be thrown off. So it takes a little bit of orchestrating in order to do properly, but in general what people find is that this can allow you to enhance performance overall of these individual movements. Again, while maintaining the same amount of rest and even if you choose not to do this, I encourage you to pay attention to this as a concept because again, it's leveraging this idea of antagonistic muscles, flexors and extensors. In taginistic neural relationships between the spinal cord mechanisms that control one set of muscles and activating those muscles, allowing the opposite antagonistic muscle to relax and therefore to perform better on its next set. So now I'd like to shift to the question of what types of stretching can and should we do to increase limb range of motion. If our goal is to do that in the most efficient way possible because I realize that most people don't have endless amounts of time to dedicate to a stretching practice. And even for those of us that do, I'm sure that you want to get the most outcome for a given effort. And what are the modes of stretching that are going to allow us to increase our flexibility and limb range of motion most safely. Now, there are a number of different types of stretching or methods of stretching. Broadly defined, we can describe these as dynamic, ballistic, static, and what's called PNF stretching. PNF stands for appropriate, receptive, neuromuscular facilitation and it involves and leverages many of the mechanisms that I described you earlier. The first two that I mentioned, dynamic and ballistic stretching both involve some degree of momentum and can be distinguished from static and PNF type stretching. Now to distinguish dynamic stretching from ballistic stretching, like to focus on this element of momentum. Both involve moving a limb through a given range of motion. In dynamic stretching, however, it tends to be more controlled, less use of momentum, especially towards the end range of motion. Whereas in ballistic stretching, there tends to be a bit more swinging of the limb or use of momentum. So I invite you to visualize what dynamic and ballistic stretching might look like in your mind. You can even try it if it's safe for you to try it. You could imagine swinging your arm up overhead as much as possible and bringing it down. You can see it as kind of ridiculous movement to do well seated or perhaps at all. But for instance, you can see dynamic and ballistic stretching anytime someone for instance is holding onto something with one arm or maybe not holding on and swinging out their foot. So essentially getting movement about the hip joint. And you'll notice that some people raise it up and pause it and bring it down. That's one form of dynamic stretching, whereas others will swing it up and sort of let it. Carry itself a bit further due to the momentum at the top of the movement and then just let it drop back down or maybe even control the descent. There is an enormous range of parameter space here or variables that one could imagine. And there's just simply no way that we could subdivide all those. But again, dynamic and ballistic stretching both involve movement. So we have to generate some force in order to create that movement. And we have to make stretching involving a bit more momentum or sometimes a lot more momentum, especially at the end range of motion. Now both of those are highly distinct from static stretching, which involves holding the end range of motion. So minimizing the amount of momentum that's used. So to stay with a simple example that we are all now familiar with from our earlier discussion. Slowly bending over at the waist and trying to touch your toes or putting your hands to the floor and then holding that end position. Before coming up in a slow and controlled way such that you reduce the amount of momentum to near zero. Would be one example of static stretching. Static stretching can be further subdivided into active or passive. There are different names for these kinds of approaches. You can hear about the Anderson approach or the John Derr approach. You can look these sorts of things up online. And again people tend to name things after themselves. Some of these are proprietary related specific programs. I'm not focusing on those. Others come to be named after the physiologists or the practitioners that initially popularize them. As is always the case, there's always a naming and renaming and claiming of territory with these things. For the time being, I'd like to just emphasize that static stretching can be both active where there's a dedicated effort on the part of the structure. You to put force behind the hold to kind of extend or literally to extend the range of motion. And then there's also passive static stretching in which it's more of a relaxation into a further range of motion. And that can be a subtle distinction and there are other ways in which we can further distinguish active and passive static stretching. But nonetheless static stretching involves both those types of elements active and passive. But is really about eliminating momentum. And then there's the PNF, the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and proprioception has several different meanings in the context of neuroscience and physiology to just keep it really simple for today. The proprioception involves both a knowledge and understanding of where our limbs are in space and relative to our body. Typically relative to the midline. So the brain is often trying to figure out where our our limbs relative to our midline down the center of our body. And we know where our limbs are based on so-called proprioceptive feedback. So that's feedback that comes from sensory neurons. You know what sensory neurons that are essentially monitoring or responding to events within the joints, the connective tissue and the muscles. And within the deep components of the muscles like the spindle reflacks and within the tendons like the GTO, the Golgi tendon organ. So PNF type stretching leverages these sorts of mechanisms, these neural circuits. By way of for instance, you would lie on your back and if your goal is to increase your hamstring flexibility and the flexibility and range of motion of other related muscle systems. You might put a strap around your ankle and pull that muscle where I say, excuse me, that limb towards you and I'm going to pull the muscle towards you. You're going to pull that limb your ankle towards you trying to get it sort of back over your head and then progressively relaxing into that or maybe even putting some additional force to push the end range of motion and then relaxing it and then actually trying to stretch that same limb or increase the limb range of motion without the strap. Sometimes these are assisted by other people. So people will even use loads. Sometimes they'll even use machines. They're a number of different apparatus that have been designed for this. Sometimes it will involve a training partner. There's a huge range of PNF protocols. And those protocols can be done both by oneself, with or without straps, with machines with actual weights or with training partners. If you're interested in the variation of exercises to say target your hamstrings versus your quadriceps versus your shoulders versus your chest muscles, etc. Your neck muscles and so on. There is an enormous range of information on dynamic, ballistic, static and PNF stretches for all the various muscle groups. And I should say there's some excellent books on those topics. There are also some excellent videos on YouTube and elsewhere. Nowadays it's pretty easy to find exercises that allow you to target specific muscle groups. Again, I encourage you to be safe in how you approach this and I would encourage you also to pay attention to the information that soon follows as to what sorts of protocols one would use to apply those exercises. But the number of exercises and the availability of those exercises for targeting different muscle groups with these four different kinds of stretching is both immense and, fortunately, thankfully, immediately accessible to all of us often at zero cost. So specific exercises to target specific muscle groups aside. We've now established that there are four major categories of stretching or at least those are the four major categories I'm defining today. And we can further divide those categories into which are the ones that are going to be most effective for increasing range of motion in the long term, not just in one individual session. And there have been a number of studies exploring this. I can list out at least four and we'll put those four as a kind of a cluster under one heading in the show note captions that arrive at essentially the same answer, which is that for increasing limb range of motion. It does appear that static type, including PNF, but static type stretching is going to be more effective than dynamic and ballistic stretching. So, at least to my mind, this is good news. Why is it good news to me? Well, well, dynamic and ballistic stretching can be immensely useful for improving performance of specific movements in particular in the context of particular sports like. Tennis or in sprinting or frankly for any sport. They do carry with them a certain amount of risk because of the use of momentum. So you don't need to be highly trained in order to perform them. In fact, there is a place and we will describe when one would want to apply dynamic or ballistic stretching. I'll just give away for now. I think that most physios out there and certainly the ones that I spoke to Dr. Andy Galpin. Dr. Kelly Starrette and a few others. Point to the fact that doing some safe dynamic and ballistic stretching prior to say a resistance training session or maybe even prior to a cardiovascular training session can be useful. Both in terms of range of motion effects and in terms of neural activation effects. I don't want to use the words warm up because warming up is typically associated with increasing core body temperature as it should be. But for engaging the neural circuits and becoming familiarized with the neural circuits that you're about to use in other movements. While also increasing the range of motion of the joints involved in those movements so that you can perform them more safely and more confidently. So I'm certainly not saying, I want to repeat, I'm certainly not saying that dynamic and ballistic stretching are not useful. They absolutely are. But in terms of increasing limb range of motion in the long term of truly becoming more flexible as opposed to transiently more flexible. Static stretching which includes PNF appears to be the best route to go. So if your goal is to increase your limb range of motion for a given muscle group or perhaps for all muscle groups, although can imagine that would be pretty tough. I mean, I can spend time working on your tongue muscle control or neck muscle control and every muscle control, but most of us want to reduce so-called tightness in air quotes and increase limb range of motion for certain muscle groups. And it appears that the best way to do that is going to be static stretching of some kind, which raises the question of how often to do that static stretching and how long to hold those static stretches. And we can also ask the question, we should ask the question, where to hold those static stretches? Is it always a good idea to hold those static stretches at the end or the point of maximal range of motion? We're going to address that now. There's some terrific science around this. A slightly older study, but nonetheless, a powerful one because it provided a foundation for a lot of subsequent work, which basically served to just confirm the answer they got here, is this study from Bandie at all, the title of this study is the effect of time and frequency of static stretching on the flexibility of the hamstring muscles. This study involving 93 subjects, so 61 men, 32 women, ranging in age from 21 to 39 years, a broad demographic, who had limited hamstring muscle flexibility here on paraphrasing and randomly aside to one of five groups. So the four stretching group stretch five days per week for six weeks, the fifth group was served as a control did not stretch. The results clearly show that, quote, the change in flexibility appeared to be dependent on the duration and frequency of stretching. This is great. This tells us that stretching for a given amount of time scales with the amount of limb range of motion improvement that one will see. There were many interesting findings within this study, but the one that I'd like to highlight most is quote, the results of this study suggest that a 30 second duration is an effective amount of time to sustain a hamstring muscle stretch in order to increase range of motion. No increase in flexibility occurred when the duration of stretching was increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds, or when the frequency of stretching was increased from one to three times per day. Okay, so now we're starting to lay down some parameters. What this study reveals and what subsequent studies tell us and we will get into those subsequent studies is that ideally one would do static stretches that are held for 30 seconds. Perhaps more in certain instances and I'll explain when that can be useful, but here holding those stretches for more than 30 seconds did not turn out to be additionally useful. So if you're going to stretch your quadricep for instance and you're going to hold that stretch in static facture, remember not using momentum. And you can use the mental tricks of either trying to push through the pain, which I don't recommend necessarily. I think that makes us prone to injury or to relax into the stretch, but nonetheless providing some force typically with the with the hand in order to pull your ankle back. If you're doing a quadricep stretch, some people might do this on the edge of a sofa. Remember there are a lot of different exercises in ways to do this that you can explore elsewhere. Well holding that static stretch for 30 seconds appears to be sufficient to stimulate an increase in limb range of motion over time. Again, these are protocols that were used repeatedly over time and we'll talk about how often to repeat them in order to get maximum effect. But 30 second holds for static stretches is the number that I think we want to focus on and that most of us are going to want to utilize. So now let's explore how many sets of static stretching one ought to do in order to get a maximum range of motion improvement while not placing us into a system that's going to create injury, nor a situation where we have to be constantly stretching throughout the day because again, most of us don't have time to do that. This issue of sets is an important one. In the context of cardiovascular exercise, we've talked about the data that support the fact that doing at least 150 and ideally, as much as 200 minutes per week of zone two cardiovascular exercises is very useful for cardiovascular health and for other aspects of health. Of course, there are other aspects of cardiovascular exercise that can be layered onto and into that that can be useful like 90 second maximal sprints, etc. Discuss this a lot in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin and on our episode about endurance. And we also talked about sets in the context of strength and high-perchrophy building, building muscle size and or strength in the episode about that and in particular in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin. And there we could also arrive at some specific parameters and it's going to vary of course between individuals depending on how hard you train, whether or not you take sets to failure, your repetition range, etc. But in the context of strength and high-perchrophy building, we arrived at a approximately six, maybe as many as ten sets per week per muscle group. Also group, some of that work is done as direct work to a given muscle group, some of that work is indirect, so doing certain pulling exercise, of course, will target the lat-tissum as dorsy muscles, but also the biceps. So if you, that doesn't necessarily mean you have to do ten sets for the biceps and for the lats, sometimes you're getting some indirect work, etc. All of that was delineated in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin. We arrived at those numbers of sets according to the same criteria that we will apply here. What is the minimum number of sets both to maintain and to improve a given mode of performance? Strength and high-perchrophy or cardiovascular health, again, to either maintain or improve and we can do the same thing for improving or maintaining range of motion. Because as I mentioned earlier, the data point to the fact that if we don't do some dedicated work to improve range of motion over time, we will lose our flexibility and limb range of motion over time, just by virtue of the fact that we're not doing anything to offset that. So whether or not you want to maintain, re-establish or gain limb range of motion, static stretching of holds of 30 seconds appear to be best. Now the question is how long should you do that and how many sets should you do that and how many times a week should you do that? And to answer those questions, I'm going to turn to what I think is a really spectacular review. This was a review that was published in the year 2018. So it's fairly recent. First off, Thomas, it wouldn't Thomas last author, Paul Ma, we will put a link to this in the show note caption. The title of the paper is the relation between stretching, typology and stretching duration, the effects on range of motion. It's a very straightforward title. This is a review article that explored a number of different studies had criteria for whether or not those studies could be evaluated in the context of the questions here. And basically, we know down large collection of studies to a remaining 23 articles that were able to be considered, quote, eligible and included in the quantitative synthesis done here. So key points from that quantification and synthesis done in this paper. First of all, and I quote, all stretching typologies showed range of motion improvements over a long term period. However, the static protocols showed significant gains with a p-value S&.05, which means a probability that cannot be explained by chance alone, when compared to ballistic or p&F protocols. So again, what we're hearing is that static stretching is the preferred mode for increasing limb range of motion. Although here they make the additional point that static stretching might even be superior, not just to ballistic stretching, but also to p&F protocols. Because before as you may recall, there was a distinction between ballistic and dynamic and static and p&F. And so here it appears again that static stretching is kind of rising to the top of the list as the optimal approach relative to all other stretching approaches, at least in the context of increasing limb range of motion. The authors go on to say, time spent stretching per week seems fundamental to elicit range of movement improvements when stretches are applied for at least or more than five minutes per week. Okay, this is critical. This is not five minutes per stretch. Remember 30 seconds per static stretch, but at least five minutes per week. Whereas the time spent stretching within a single session does not seem to have a significant effects for range of motion gains. If this is getting confusing, I'll make sure that you soon understand exactly what we can export from these conclusions. The data indicate that performing stretching at least five days a week. Some of you may already be groaning for at least five minutes per week. Okay, so five days per week. That's a lot, but at least five minutes per week five minutes per week is not that much. Using static stretching may be beneficial to promote range of motion improvements. Okay, I've read this study in detail now. They highlight again the reduction in flexibility that occurs from 20 or 49 years of age and so on. How acute bouts of short term stretching up to three weeks can improve stretch tolerance. I think that's a key point that in the short term the first three weeks of embarking on a stretching and flexibility program. Much of the improvements come from the short term neural improvements that we talked about before of inhibiting the spindle reflux and so on and also a stretched tolerance. A comfort with doing the movements and maybe even a comfort in overriding some of the pain mechanisms. I'll talk a little bit more about that in just a bit and the particular utility of yoga. Something that I don't often practice, but that after reading this article that I'll mention in a little bit. I'm considering perhaps taking up some form of yoga protocol. Now I've already highlighted some of the key takeaways from the study. Namely that we need to get at least five minutes per week of static stretching per muscle group. And based on the previous paper that we talked about, we need to divide that five minutes into sets of 30 seconds each. And as I mentioned earlier, it doesn't seem to be the case that you can do all of that in one day. Unfortunately, it does seem important that the frequency of stretching practice distributed throughout the week is important. So let's talk protocols. We are now talking about doing static stretching, so holding, so limiting momentum and holding a stretch for 30 seconds per set. We're talking about trying to achieve five minutes per week of those static holds, but that we can't do it all in one session because the frequency of sessions distributed throughout the week correlates with the improvements in the limb range of motion. So what this means is that we should probably be doing anywhere from two to four sets of 30 second static hold stretches. Five days per week or some variant thereof. And I do say some variant thereof because it turns out that even though there was that earlier study that we talked about that holding a stretch for more than 30 seconds in that case 60 seconds didn't turn out to be additionally beneficial. It appears that if you do hold those stretches for 60 seconds per static stretching set for instance, you can get away with stretching fewer days per week overall. So in order to make this as clear as possible because I do realize there are a lot of parameters and you might be asking why didn't you just make me a list of the exact things I should do? Well, it doesn't work that way because once you understand the mechanisms and once you understand your particular goals, this information is designed for you to be able to construct a stretching program that is tailored to your specific goals. If I just gave you the stretching program that I'm doing or I should say that I'm soon to be doing because I'm soon to be doing one based on the research for this particular episode. Well, that wouldn't be beneficial for you because for instance, if you have very flexible hamstrings, but not very flexible quadriceps or you are somebody who is engaged in sport or not engaged in sport. What you need to do is going to vary somewhat. So what would affective stretching protocol look like? We're all trying to improve limb range of motion for different limbs and different muscle groups, but just by way of example, and it's because the one we've been using, let's talk about hamstrings for the time being. This could of course be applied to other muscle groups. Let's say you want to improve hamstring flexibility and limb range of motion about and around the hamstring and involving the hamstring. You would want to do three sets of static stretching for the hamstring. Again, easy to find such exercises on the internet. You would do that by holding the stretch for 30 seconds, resting some period of time and doing it again, holding for 30 seconds, resting some period of time, and then holding it for 30 seconds. That would be one training session for the hamstrings. I have to imagine that you'd probably want to stretch other muscle groups as well in that same session. Although, at least as far as I could tell, there were no data pointing to the fact that you couldn't do your hamstring stretching one part of the day and you're quadriceps stretching another part of the day. But presumably, you're going to want to combine your flexibility training into one single session. So, three sets of 30 seconds each, get 90 seconds and you would do that ideally five times a week or maybe even more. Because it does seem like frequency distributed throughout the week is an important parameter. Now, one thing that we have not highlighted or at least described is how long to rest between stretching sets. And despite my efforts, I could not find research back information that pointed to whether or not 30 seconds of rest for every 30 seconds stretching or 60 seconds rest for every 30 seconds stretching was ideal. I think it's reasonable to assume that doubling the amount of time for the interleaving rest would be appropriate or at least doable. If anyone out there has knowledge about rest between stretching sets and has some physiology or some biology or some experiential information as to why a given ratio of duration of static stretch to rest in between static stretch sets. I'll ought to be used, please put it in the comments on YouTube that'd be a terrific way for us to get that information. I'd love to do any follow-up to links that you provide and so on. But now we're starting to build into a protocol that is backed by the scientific data. Three sets of 30 seconds of holds done five times or maybe even six times per week. One thing that did show up in my exploration of the peer reviewed research is this notion of warming up for all this. We haven't talked about that yet. In general to avoid injury, it's a good idea to raise your core body temperature a bit before doing these kinds of stretches, even these static stretches which we can sort of ease into and don't involve ballistic movement by definition. And the basic takeaway that I was able to find was that if we are already warm from running or from weight training or from some other activity that doing the static stretching practice at the end of that weight training or cardiovascular or other physical session would allow us to go immediately into the stretching session. So, we're all ready warm, so to speak. Otherwise raising one's core body temperature by a bit by doing five to seven, maybe even ten minutes of easy cardiovascular exercise or calisthenic movements. Provide you can do those without getting injured. Seems to be an ideal way to warm up the body for stretching. We should be warm or warm up to stretch, although those warmups don't have to be extremely extensive. By the way, of logic doing the static stretching after resistance training or cardiovascular training seems to be most beneficial. In fact, and unfortunately, we don't have time to go into this in too much detail today. I was able to find a number of papers that make the argument that static stretching prior to cardiovascular training and maybe even prior to resistance training can limit our performance in running and resistance training. I realize that's a controversial area. You have those who say, no, it's immensely beneficial. You have those who say, no, it inhibits performance and those that say, no, it's a matter of how exactly perform that static stretching and which muscle groups and how you're doing this and how much time in between. Static stretching and performance, but to leave all that aside, doing static stretching after some other form of exercise and if not after some form of exercise after a brief warmup to raise your core body temperature, definitely seems like the right way to go. Now, for some of you out there, and I confess for me as well, doing something five days a week seems like a big commitment, even if that commitment is one to only do three sets of 30 second static stretches. I say this because you've got the warmup, I generally like to bring a kind of a focus and dedication to a practice and of course because when doing these kinds of protocols, it's likely that you're not just stretching your hamstring, so it's not just 90 seconds of work with a minute of rest in between, but very likely that, also doing quadriceps stretching and also doing stretching for the shoulders and stretching for the back and the neck and so on. And so that entire session is going to take some time and five days a week is a pretty serious commitment for most, especially for those of us that don't exercise or do athletics for a living, which I don't. So, there is some evidence from the literature that one can get away with, or I don't even know that we should think about it as getting away with, but that one can do longer hold static stretches of up to say 60 seconds. But do fewer total sessions per week, so rather than three, 30 second static holds, doing 360 second static holds and doing those every other day. And there really has a minisystematic exploration of this, the article that I was referring to just a few moments ago. This analysis of the 23 articles was combined into this enormous set of tables and some really quite nice graphs that you're welcome to look at since we're going to provide a link to the study. There are a couple of key takeaways that I want to mention that are separate from this issue of how long the stretch and how often. First of all, they describe in their discussion that there were improvements in range of motion independent of whether or not people did static stretching active stretching passive stretching ballistic stretching or pnf stretching. So, all of those forms of stretching will improve limb range of motion. This is essential to point out and I want to emphasize this static stretching, however, gave the greatest degree of gains in limb range of motion. And on average, they saw a 20.9% increase, but some of the other increases they observed were also quite substantial. So, ballistic stretching can also provide some pretty impressive limb range of motion improvements. However, they tended to be in the range of here they point out 11.65% increase or in the case of pnf of 15% increase. So, it appears that the greatest improvements in limb range of motion for your time spent in effort spent is going to be this minimum of five minutes per week to a list of the significant response with five days being the minimum weekly recommended frequency to achieve significant range of motion improvements. I confess this was pretty surprising to me when I compare flexibility training to say resistance training for strength and high-perchrophy. I've had the experience and I know that other people have the experience and I think Dr. Andy Galpin would probably agree that provided one train's hard enough and appropriately that you don't need to train resistance training five days a week in order to get significant improvements in strength and high-perchrophy. Some people might need to, but you can get a lot of positive results in those variables with less frequent training. Certainly with three or four days a week of training. And for cardiovascular training, I'm not aware of anyone having tested whether or not one very long run each week can actually increase cardiovascular fitness and you're not doing anything. Also though, I have to imagine you'd probably see some improvement compared to not doing anything, but most people are doing repeated training sessions of cardiovascular strength training. Not a lot of people are doing five days a week of strength training, at least that I'm aware of. Some people are, but most people I think are not. And some people are doing five or more days a week of cardiovascular training. I'm guessing that most people are not doing five days a week of dedicated static stretch range of motion directed training. But it does appear that that frequency about the week getting those repeated sessions even if they are short for an individual muscle group turns out to be important. And so that points to the, perhaps the reason why so few people are doing dedicated range of motion work, but it also reminds me that all of the studies that were described at least in this review and some of the other ones that were not really show impressive changes in limb range of motion. I mean 20 plus percent or even 15 percent with PNF. I mean these are big changes that are going to benefit us. They're going to offset the age related losses in flexibility for sure. If one is dedicated about these practices. And in many cases, they're going to increase limb range of motion in ways that are going to allow us better performance and certain physical endeavors. But we're only better balanced. We haven't really talked about balance and stability, but range of motion can impair balance and stability in some extreme circumstances. But by and large limb range of motion lack of tightness improved posture improved physical performance, excuse me. And things of that sort is something that I think we can all benefit from and that are key features of longevity. We don't often think of them because we so prioritize cardiovascular health and the relationship between the heart and brain health and resistance training and musculoskeletal. High-perature fee or strength, etc. But as I delved into this literature, it really highlighted for me the extent to which having really good limb range of motion, at least maintaining limb range of motion as we age from year to year. And maybe even improving limb range of motion can be immensely beneficial for reducing pain for, again, improving posture, improving our ability to perform to walk, etc. And indeed there's a whole literature that relates our limb range of motion to things like pain management of things related to headache and so on and so forth. So limb range of motion is not just about becoming a contortionist or being able to complete the yoga class. It really is about maintaining the integrity and the health of the neural muscular system, the connective tissue, and the neural muscular connective network, because those are indeed working as an ecosystem and a network. I'd like to just briefly touch on PNF stretching for a moment. Again, this is a vast landscape with many parameters and different practitioners, a lot of competing opinions out there to put it lightly. Nonetheless, I do want to emphasize that the PNF training leverages those spindle mechanisms and GTO mechanisms that we talked about earlier, but I realized that in describing the quadricep contraction, hamstring stretch, a little mini experiment that hopefully you did, that I didn't really highlight the role of the GTOs, the Gulti tendon organs that much. And I just would like to just briefly do that for a moment. The GTOs have multiple functions. In fact, I think even though GTOs are in every medical textbook, every physiology textbook, every first year neuroscientists learns about them when learning about the neuromuscular junctions and the mechanism. Of interceptions, etc. They are likely to have other functions as well. And one of the reasons why PNF stretching does work, whether or not you're doing that by using a strap to pull back a limb or whether or not you're actively contracting your quadriceps to then release an emphasized stretch range of motion for your hamstrings and related muscle groups, is that activation of those GTOs, meaning putting loads and tension into that system, can inhibit the spindles in the opposite antagonistic muscle groups. So one of the reasons why flexing or I should say contracting your quadriceps really intensely for some bearded of time allows your hamstrings to subsequently experience greater range of motion. And again, it's not just the hamstrings, but the related connective tissue and neural circuits, etc. Is because yes, it's quote unquote relaxing the hamstrings and the spindle, but there's also a direct relationship between activation of the GTOs in the quadriceps and release of the spindles in the hamstring and related muscles. This has a name, it's called Autogenic inhibition, it's a fancy name for contraction of one muscle group providing a relaxation of the other muscle group. That's antagonistic to it. And it relates back to this idea of interleaving sets in the gym. So if you think back to that example, now it should make sense as to why for instance, if you do, let's say a set of bench presses or shoulder presses, and you let's say you get 10 repetitions and you fail on the 11th. That muscle is very, very fatigued. If you were to rest some period of time and then go back and do another set. Well, during the rest, that muscle group has been relaxing, it's obviously not contracting the same way it was during the resistance set. But by going and doing a pulling exercise that involves the antagonistic muscle group, so strongly contracting the back muscles through a pull like a pull down or a chin up or a row type exercise, you're activating or near activating the GTO system in those pulling muscles in a way that provides autogenic inhibition for the pushing muscles. Now, again, the physios out there are probably either screaming or banging their heads against whatever sound system this happens to be arriving through to them saying, wait, but in many cases, the GTOs aren't activated enough to provide that autogenic inhibition. That's true, but even the sub threshold activation of those interspinal circuits, so the place where the GTO circuit and the spindle circuit interact, can provide an additional replenishment of, say, the pushing muscles while you're activating those pulling muscles. And this is at least one, not the only, but at least one mechanisms by which interleaving push and pull, push and pull for both strength and hypertrophy training, but also for range of motion, stretching type training, can allow you to achieve better results in a shorter period of time. And I raise this because I want to keep in mind the efficiency of any training program. We just a moment ago established that doing, for example, three sets of 30 second static holds can be very useful for the hamstrings with, let's just say, for sake of simplicity and practicality, a minutes rest in between, but during that minutes rest, you can stretch the opposite antagonistic muscle group, such as the quadriceps. Or if you want to use PNF training, you could do loading of the quadriceps in between. So there are a number of different ways in which you can start to interleave static stretching with PNF stretching, you can start to interleave even PNF type protocols with resistance training, although that gets a bit more complicated. You can really start to construct and build protocols that are ideal for you. What we will do is for an upcoming neural network newsletter, so for those of you that aren't familiar, the human-minlab podcast has a so-called neural network newsletter, these are monthly newsletters where we put distilled points from the podcast and oftentimes protocols in a downloadable PDF form. You can access it by giving us your email, we don't share your email with anybody. If you want to see examples of these, you can go to humanlab.com and go to the menu and see newsletter, you don't have to sign up for anything to see examples of what these are like. I'll provide a couple of different protocols, one that is pure static stretching, one that involves PNF type stretching, and I'll also put down a protocol that involves the antagonistic interleaved muscle training of the sort that I've been describing a few times throughout this episode. You can try and apply those either separately or combine them in some way that's useful for your goals. There are a couple of key elements that are essential for building a safe and effective range of motion increasing program that arrive to us both through the peer review to research and admittedly from people that have been involved in teaching and training range of motion for a very long period of time. Some of you may be familiar with the so-called Anderson method. It's been around for a long time. I actually have never met Anderson. I don't I should know this. I don't even know if he's still alive. I hope he's still alive. But in any event, there are a lot of different features to the Anderson and other protocols. But one of the aspects of the Anderson protocol that I think is highly relevant in fact I know is relevant to the peer reviewed research that we're going to talk about in a few moments is this notion of pushing through pain. How active or how passive to be about static stretching. Now, this is somewhat subjective. If you think about getting into a stretch again, we'll just use the hamstrings for example. So you're either reaching for your toes while seated or maybe you're using a strap and you're raising your foot overhead while lying down or maybe you're doing a toe touch type exercise. How far should you reach? Where is the end range of motion? Should you balance? Should you not balance? We're going to talk a little bit more about that in a moment. But Anderson has an interesting idea in principle, which has thread through a lot of his teachings that I think are very much in keeping with the study that I'm about to describe next. Where he emphasizes to yes, to stretch to the end of the range of motion. But not to focus so much on where that range of motion happens to be that day. So, for instance, not thinking, oh, I can always touch my toes, for instance. And therefore, that's the starting place for my flexibility training today. But rather, to take the entirety of your system into account each day and understand that, okay, provided your warmed up appropriately, that you're now going to stretch your hamstrings, for instance, and you're going to reach down for your toes. That your range of motion might be adjusted that day by way of tension and stress or by way of ambient temperature in the room. And to basically define the end range of motion as the place where you can feel the stretch in the relevant muscle groups. I think this is important because unlike resistance training or cardiovascular training, where we can measure distance traveled over time in the case of cardiovascular training or how much weight is on the bar and count repetitions, et cetera, with the range of motion training, of course, range of motion is the feature that we're interested in. But there is likely to be a lot of variation from day to day based on a number of different internal and external factors. And so the Anderson method is really about getting into static and other forms of stretching. I think today we've mainly been focusing on static stretching and holding the end range of motion. But really paying attention to the feel of the stretch and the muscles involved. And there are parallels in resistance and cardiovascular training too, I realize, right? In the case of trying to build high-perrophy or I should say improve high-peratured muscle size. Oftentimes, the best advice that one can give is to don't try to lift weights, but rather to challenge muscles. Now, of course, you need to provide adequate loads in order to get high-peratured feet. When you're training purely for strength, it's about moving weights. When you're training purely for high-perrophy or mainly for high-perrophy, it's really about challenging muscles using weights or other forms of resistance. And similarly, I'm in keeping with this Anderson method when trying to build a limb range of motion, doing static stretching at a place where it's difficult, but that you can experience the stretch of the muscle cognitively, consciously, being able to focus on the muscles and their stretch is at least as useful as is evaluating the current range of motion you're able to achieve. So what does this mean? This means feel the muscles as you stretch them, don't just go through the motions, and this means don't get so attached to being able to always achieve, for instance, a stretch of a given distance on a within a given session. You might actually find that by just finding the place where you can't get much further and holding the static stretch there, that on the second and third set that you happen to be doing that day, that your range of motion will be increased considerably. Maybe not, but very likely, yes, you will. And of course, evaluating range of motion over time is the key parameter, because that's the goal of all this type of work. Now, along these lines, there is this variable that we've mentioned a few times a passive versus active stretching, and there's this even more nebulous variable, this even more kind of subjective thing of how much effort to put into it, should you push into this stretch? You even want to bounce a tiny bit, would you want to reach into that endpoint and try and extend it within a given set and session. And for that reason, I was excited to find this paper entitled, a comparison of two stretching modalities on lower limb range of motion measurements in recreational dancers. Have us to be done in recreational dancers. It's a six-week intervention program that compared low intensity stretching, which they call micro stretching. They used a capital M, so I don't know if that means that it's proprietary, although I didn't see evidence of conflict of interest, but they call it micro stretching, but to be very clear micro stretching in the case of this manuscript is low intensity stretching, and they compared that with moderate intensity static stretching on an active and passive. Ranges of motion, okay, so there are a lot of different variables are here, but I'll just highlight a few of the things that are really most relevant to us, and I'll give you the takeaway at the outset, and then return to it at the end, so that if I lose any of your attention in the next couple of minutes, at least you have that key takeaway. Basically what they found was that a six-week training program using very low intensity stretching had a greater positive effect on lower limb range of motion than did moderate intensity static stretching. I find that incredibly interesting, so very low intensity, and we'll define what that means in a moment. Here I'm quoting them. The most interesting aspect of the study was the greater increase in active range of motion compared to passive range of motion by the micro stretching group. This relates to what we were just talking about a few moments ago, as it relates to the Anderson method, which is that very low intensity stretching, meaning effort that feels not painful, and in fact, might even feel easy, or at least not straining to exceed a given range of motion, turns out to not just be as effective, but more effective than moderate intensity stretching. So what is low intensity static stretching? Well, they define this as the stretches were completed at an intensity of 30 to 40%. Where 100% equals the point of pain, right? So 30 to 40% in these individuals, and again, I'm paraphrasing, induced a relaxed state within the individual and the specific muscle. And here they were holding these static stretches, I should mention, for one minute, not 30 seconds. Now the control group was doing the exact same overall protocol, so daily stretching for six weeks, the same exercises, holding each set for 60 seconds, but we're using an intensity of 80% where again, 100 represents the point of pain, and the point where the person would want to stop stretching. I find these data incredibly interesting for, I think, what ought to be obvious reasons. If you're going to embark on a flexibility and stretching training program, you don't need to push to the point of pain. In fact, it seems that even just approaching the point of pain is going to be less effective than operating at this 30 to 40% of intensity prior to reaching that pain threshold, the pain threshold being 100%. Now of course, this is pretty subjective, but I think all of us should be able to register within ourselves, so whether a given range of motion or extending a given range of motion brings us to that threshold of pain or near pain. And according to this study, at least, operating or performing stretching at an intensity that's quite low, that's very relaxing, turns out to be more beneficial in increasing range of motion than is doing exercises aimed at increasing range of motion at a higher intensity. Okay, so lower intensity stretching, I should say lower intensity static stretching appears to be the most beneficial way to approach stretching, and I think that's a relief. And probably to many of us, because it also suggests that the injury risk is going to be lower than if one were pushing into the pain zone, so to speak. The authors offer a number of different explanations as to why this approach, this micro stretching approach might be more effective. Here I'm paraphrasing from their discussion where they mentioned that it could be hypothesized that they had improved reciprocal inhibition within the hamstring muscle group. This gets right back to the sorts of neural mechanisms that we talked about before that somehow by doing this low intensity stretching that they were able to access some of those spindle and GTO type mechanisms that we were referring to earlier and the inhibition of hamstring and quadricep stretches. So, it's also often a number of different ideas about how this could shift the activation of the so-called sympathetic, remember the kind of stress division of our nervous system, and to reduce that relative to activation of the parasympathetic arm of the nervous system. I confess they have a couple of arguments around sympathetic parasympathetic that are somewhat convoluted. I will just in fairness to the neuroscience on those systems, I wouldn't suggest putting too much weight on their arguments about sympathetic and parasympathetic to my mind. They didn't really hold much water, but here I'm not trying to be disparaging of the overall work which I think is really quite sound, which is that low intensity, so called micro stretching, is going to be the most effective way to increase limb range of movement. I want to just briefly return to this idea whether or not to do ballistic or static stretching before some sort of skill training or weight training or any kind of sport or even cardiovascular exercise like running. Again, the data are really split out there. There are even folks who suggest that doing any kind of stretching prior to running is going to lower running efficiency. It's going to require essentially more work and more oxygen uptake at a given speed for a variety of reasons and runners and that community argue about this endlessly. There are papers in both sides and both directions. I'm sure I'll hear about some of this in the comments. I'm not really going to take a stance on this as a consequence because the data are all over the place. However, I think there's a general logic that we can apply in here. I'm borrowing from some conversations and some information put out there by Dr. Andy Galpin, who I think is of course both an expert and things about these things in a really sound and flexible way. No pun intended. There are instances, for example, where an individual might want to do some static stretching to increase limb range of motion prior to doing weight training. Even if it's going to inhibit that person's ability to lift as much weight. Why would you want to do that? Well, for instance, if somebody has a tightness or a limitation in their neuromuscular connective tissue system someplace in their body and system that prevents them from using proper form that they can overcome by doing some static stretching. Well, that would be a great idea as Dr. Galpin points out. Or for instance, if proper stability within the movement requires increasing limb range of motion in some way, well then compromising the use of greater loads could be greatly offset by doing some static stretching to improve, say, hamstring flexibility or another muscle group flexibility. So we can't always think about just what's going to allow us or inhibit us from using the maximum amount of weight or from running as far as we want to run as fast as we want to run. There are instances where people are trying to overcome injuries, where they're trying to come back from a reparative surgery or something of that sort coming back from a layoff where some additional static stretching prior to cardiovascular weight training or skill training or sport of some kind is going to be useful. Because it's going to put us in a position of greater safety and confidence and performance overall even if it's adjusting down our speed or the total amount of loads that we use. So it's you that needs to consider whether or not for you and within a given training session you want to do static training. I should say static stretching range of motion training prior to or after that training session. And similarly, there are a lot of data points in the fact that doing some dynamic or even ballistic stretching prior to skill training or cardiovascular weight training can be beneficial. In part to warm up the relevant neural circuits joins in connected tissue and muscles and as well to perhaps improve range of motion or ability to perform those movements more accurately with more stability and therefore with more confidence. And while Dr. Andy Galpin would never name any protocol after himself he's far too humble to do that. I've named a couple of protocols after him, particularly the Galpin equation for hydration because he was willing to stick his neck out there and put down some specific numbers that people could follow in order to ensure proper hydration during training. And look up the Galpin equation elsewhere you can just Google it or look elsewhere you know find it and. Dr. Galpin has also been very thoughtful and generous and I think very accurate in offering a kind of a general organizational logic for how to think about the goals of a particular training session and. Thereby to decide whether or not you're going to do ballistic or static stretching and so on and so forth so we can refer to this general approach as Galpinian Galpinian is that right Galpinian logic Galpinian logic. That's far we've been talking about stretching for sake of increasing limb flexibility and range of motion, but there are other reasons perhaps to embark on a stretching protocol. That include both our ability to relax and access deep relaxation quickly as well as even to reduce inflammation and perhaps even combat certain forms of cancer. And if that sounds really far fetched. I want to emphasize that the study I'm about to share with you in a moment was actually carried out by one of the directors of a division of the National Institutes of Health. And this was the work of Helen Langvann who's a medical doctor has done really important work on. The mechanisms underlying things like acupuncture and has approached all that from a very mechanistic view point right so not looking just at the effects of acupuncture but really trying to understand what sorts of cytokines inflammatory. And what sort of neural mechanisms get engaged by things like acupuncture that impinges on the facial tissues and so forth. And Dr. Langvann is a currently director of the National Institutes of Complementary Health and medicine at the National Institutes of Health. And it's a major division supported by tax dollars that support systematic mechanistic exploration of things like respiration, meditation, yoga, acupuncture. So this is serious science applied to protocols and approaches that have been used for some period of time but really aimed at trying to understand what would the best protocols be to evolve new protocols. So there's a really interesting study done in animal models but I think it's a powerful enough result that I think we all should pay attention to it. That title of this paper and again the last author is Dr. Langvann herself is stretching reduces tumor growth in a mouse breast cancer model and yes you can get mice to stretch it turns out that if you gently lift up mice by their tail and they'll hold on to their cage there's a way in which you can mechanically stretch them in a way that doesn't harm them. First I should mention that Dr. Langvann and others have shown that just a brief whole body stretch of that sort induces an increase in activation of the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system. And not arm limb arm but the aspect of the autonomic nervous system that creates a whole body, whole nervous system shift toward more relaxation. So yes indeed stretching induces relaxation at a systemic level not just at a local level and I think that's important. Probably not surprising to those of you that use stretching regularly but yes it does indeed relax us. Yes you can do this in mice and see that in mice as well. Here's what they did for this current study or I should say this was a study published in 2018 and scientific reports. They write recent studies have shown that gentle daily stretching for 10 minutes can reduce local connective tissue inflammation in fibrosis. Now that's local tissue inflammation in fibrosis. As well we now know as systemic inflammation and can induce relaxation systemically. In this case they focused on mice not humans and mice were randomized to a stretch versus no stretch condition and were treated for 10 minutes once a day for four weeks. So it's 10 minutes of this passive whole body stretching a day for four weeks. What's remarkable I mean just I have to say is just striking is that tumor volume in these mice. They were able to induce tumors in these mice and the tumor volume at the end point was 52% smaller in the stretch group. Compared to the no stretch group this is a highly significant effect and they point out in the absence of any other treatment. And they explored whether or not cytotoxic immune responses were activated and a number of other features they weren't able to get too deeply into the underlying mechanisms. But this is pretty remarkable even three weeks into this stretching protocol this daily stretching protocol for these mice tumor volume was reduced I mean by you know it's almost half this is pretty incredible. So they have these measures of tumor volume and the only difference in the way these animals were treated and handled was the introduction of this daily stretch. I find this result to be of course limited in the to the extent that it's done in an animal model not in humans we have to point it out. But as they point out in their discussion our results demonstrate a 52% reduction in memory tumor growth over one month in mice undergoing stretching for 10 minutes a day without any other form of therapy. Do they think that stretching itself is changing the tumor size no in fact they raise the possibility that stretching because of its impact on the fascia might even create micro environments that are more permissive for tumor growth in certain instances. So they're careful to emphasize what I also believe to be the case which is that it's unlikely that the stretching itself was directly acting to reduce tumor size. Rather that there's this possible link between inflammation and immune exhaustion mechanisms that if you can periodically relax a nervous system. Here through stretching that it can affect certain pathways related to the immune system that would allow the immune system to combat tumor growth to a significant degree. So again even though this is a study in mice it argues that relaxation induced by stretching can have a powerful influence on memory tumor growth again huge effect carried out by. One of the premier labs and individuals who do this sort of work and think about this sort of thing and of course I want to point out it wasn't just Dr. Langovan that did this study there a number of coauthors on the study will provide a link to the coauthors. Excuse me we'll provide a link to the study so that you can produce it in more detail if you like now as a related and somewhat final point. I'd like to return this to this idea and this place this real estate within our brain that we call the insular cortex the insula. So we call way back at the beginning of this episode we're talking about the Vaughn economy neurons that Constantine Vaughn economy the Austrian scientist discovered and the fact that we are able to make and perform interpretations of our internal landscape pain our. The education to a practice for instance whether or not we are in pain because it's a practice that we are doing intentionally and want to improve ourselves or whether or not it's pain that's arriving through some externally imposed demands or situations. So the insula is handling all that and fortunately there's a wonderful paper that was published a few years ago now in the journal cerebral cortex which is a fine journal this is the year 2014 entitled insular cortex mediates increased pain tolerance in yoga practitioners I'll tell you why I like this study. I'm personally not a practitioner yoga taking a few yoga classes over the years have done some of the hot yoga classes. Those rooms can get really really warm I confess and I've done the kind of standard yoga every now and again it's not something that I've kept up regularly. This study explored the effects on brain structure volume in yoga practitioners and for those of you out there that are aficionados in yoga they they pulled subjects from. I'm probably going to miss pronounce these different things and forgive me the vinyasa yoga's the ashtanga yoga's younger yoga's the sonanda yoga's okay so some people were new to these practices somewhere. I'm experienced that the important takeaways were that they took these yoga practitioners and they didn't explore their brain structure in the context of yoga itself they looked at things like pain tolerance. So they used thermal stimulation basically they put people into conditions where they gave them very hot or very cold stimuli and compared those yoga practitioners of varying levels of yoga experience to those that had no experience with yoga so called controls and they found some really interesting things. A lot of data on this paper but. Here's something I'd like to highlight the pain tolerance of yoga practitioners was. Double or more to that of non yoga practitioners even for those that weren't doing this local hot yoga right they also found that pain tolerance was significantly greater both for heat pain and for cold pain. They also found significant increases in insular. Again the insula this brain region gray matter volume typically when we talk about gray matter we're talking about the so called cell bodies the. The location in neurons where the genome is housed and where the all the housekeeping stuff is there and then white matter volume tends to be the axons the wires because they're in sheath with this stuff that appears white in MRIs and indeed is white under the microscope and indeed is white it's actually lipid which is mild. So increased gray matter volume of the insula. Is a significant finding because what it suggests is that people that are doing yoga have an increase volume of these areas of the brain they're associated with inter receptive awareness and for being able to make judgments about. Pain and why one is experiencing pain not just a lean away from pain but to utilize or leverage or even overcome pain so there are many studies of yoga and meditation out there. Few that have as much mechanistic detail as this one and in fact. There's a beautiful figure figure three in this paper that shows that the gray matter volume of this particular brain region scales in almost linear way. With the duration of yoga practice that somebody has been taking on in years so people that had like. They had a few subjects that have up to 15 or 16 years of yoga practice had much larger. Left insular gray matter volume bigger. Brain areas associated with these abilities and I find this interesting because there are a lot of activities out there that don't. Create these kind of changes in brain volume is especially within the insula so it appears that it's not just the performance of the yoga movements but the overcoming or the kind of pushing into the end ranges of motion. And then to push through discomfort to some extent of course we want people doing that in a healthy safe way but that's allows yoga practitioners to build up the structure and function of these brain areas that allow them to cope with pain better than other individuals and to cope with other kinds of. Inter receptive challenges if you will not just pain but cold not just pain but discomfort of being in a particular position. To do that and again we wouldn't want people placing themselves into a compromise position literally that would harm them especially given that earlier we heard that microstratching of the kind of non painful sort low intensity sort is actually going to be more effective for increasing end range of motion but this study really emphasize the extent to which. Practitioners of yoga don't just learn movements they learn how to control their nervous system in ways that really reshapes their relationship to pain. Two flexibility and two the kinds of things that the neuromuscular system was designed to do and as a final point. There's a beautiful graph in this paper beautiful I think because it explores some of the more subjective dimensions of. Yoga and insular function which is a here I'll read it out in the nerdy form and then I'll explain what it means this is a frequency histogram of categories of mental strategies used by yogis versus controls during the. Cold pain tolerance task what they're describing here and showing is quantitatively. How people are conceptualizing cold pain in order to get through it and the different categories are for instance distraction right some people just choose to distract themselves from pain or to attempt to other people try to ignore it it's a lot like distraction but. Nonetheless to engage in a negative emotion sort of like I'm going to dig I'm going to be in resistance to this. Control subjects tended to use those approaches whereas practitioners of yoga tended to use other sorts of subjective approaches like positive imagery to some extent. The ability to relax despite the extreme cold the ability to quote unquote accept like this is just happening despite the extreme cold to observe to third person themselves and. The greatest effect of course was to breathe to focus on their respiration as a way to deal with this. Challenge this cold challenge now all of that is subject of data but I want to remind you that the practitioners of yoga are not just using entirely different mental strategies but they are far more effective at dealing with pain their pain tolerance is much higher. As evidence by the other data in the previous graphs in the paper so while this podcast episode is most certainly not about yoga per se it's about flexibility and stretching flexibility and stretching our elements within yoga practices. And of course you'll get practices involved breathing and mental work and a lot of other things balance etc. it's a vast landscape as many of you know. But I think that. If ever there was a manuscript that pointed to the utility of something like yoga foreseek of tapping into a particular set of brain circuits and mechanisms that could wick out into multiple dimensions of life. So day to day life stress challenges in dealing with all sorts of external stressors career related family related relationally etc etc. But as well for increasing range of motion for increasing flexibility. So if ever there was a practice that one could embark on that would not only increase flexibility and limb range of motion but would also allow one to cultivate some improved mental functioning as it relates to pain tolerance and other features of stress management that no doubt wick out into other areas of life. It appears that yoga is a quite useful practice and so for those of you that are interested in increasing limb range of motion and you're already a practitioner of yoga great. Can imagine that someday there will be another study like this one and you'll be in that you know 10 or 15 to 16 year practitioner graph you'll be that dot way out on the far end of the graph that shows that you're insol as that much bigger than the rest of hours. And therefore your internal awareness and pain thresholds and stress management will be that much better but of course yoga isn't the only way to increase limb range of motion and flexibility. Up until now we've described a number of different ways to do that and we've arrived at some general themes and protocols again. Those themes and protocols will be distilled into some specific and precise list in our neural network newsletter but we can revisit a couple of them now just in summary and synthesis. Static stretching appears to be at least among the more useful forms of stretching so low or zero moment and stretching typically at end range of motion. I love this concept of microst stretching even though it's just a couple of studies that have addressed whether not high intensity or low intensity static stretch holds are more beneficial the idea and indeed the data that low intensity so 30 to 40 percent of what would one would consider painful appears to be. More effective than 80 percent of that threshold find that incredibly interesting and then there's this idea of frequency it really does appear the getting. At least five minutes per week total of stretching for a given muscle group is important for creating meaningful lasting changes in limb range of motion and that is best achieved by. Five day a week or six day a week or even seven day a week protocols but those can be very short protocols limited to say three sets of 30 maybe in 45 or 60 seconds of static hold although 30 seconds seems to be. This threshold there that can get you maximum benefit there is no need to do full 60 second holds unless you're doing fewer total sessions per week and of course to always warm up or to arrive at the stretching session warm and then of course there are the other forms of stretching that we touched upon a bit things like pnf and we talked about why pnf works things like the spindle and the gold g tendon organ reflexes that are built into all of us that we arrive in this world with. Of course the other forms of stretching that are known to be effective and important such as dynamic and ballistic stretching. Again stretching protocols that involve a lot of momentum in order to improve range of motion for performance of particular types of work that one is about to embark on typically that would be physical work but a whole interesting and unexplored landscape is the extent to which. Changing limb range of motion and different types of body movement actually shape our cognitive abilities and that will be the topic of a future episode of this podcast.

Not so much on today's episode, but in many episodes of the Huperman Lab podcast, we talk about supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people drive tremendous benefit from them for things like improving the transition time and depth of sleep or for improving focus. Or for a variety of other things, including things like anxiety management. For that reason, the Huperman Lab podcast has decided to partner with Momentus supplements. First of all, Momentus supplements are of the very highest quality. They're user-right-variant professional sports teams, and they have contracts with various government organizations exploring the role of particular supplements in human performance. Second of all, they ship internationally because we know a number of you are outside the country of the United States. We hope that will be useful to you. As well, we wanted to have a single location where people could go to access the most often discussed supplements here on the Huperman Lab podcast. So while the full catalog of those supplements isn't quite available yet, many of them are available. You can find them by going to livemomentus.com slash Huperman.

So thank you once again for joining me today for a discussion about the neural and neural muscular and connective tissue and skeletal aspects of flexibility and stretching. And as always, thank you for your interest in science."
vid00013," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today my guest is Dr. Andy Galpin. Dr. Galpin is a full and tenured professor in the Department of Canisiology at California State University in Fullerton. He is also a world expert in all things exercise science and canisiology. Today you are going to hear what is essentially a master class in how to build fitness, no matter what level of fitness you happen to have. He talks about how to build endurance and the multiple types of endurance. He talks about how to build strength and hypertrophy which is the growth of muscle fibers. So if you're seeking to get stronger or build bigger muscles or build endurance or all of those things today you're going to learn how. You're also going to learn how to build flexibility, how to hydrate properly for exercise and we'll also talk about nutrition and supplementation. What makes Dr. Galpin so unique is his ability to span all levels of exercise science. He has the ability to clearly communicate the sets and repetition schemes that one would want to follow for instance to build more strength or to build larger muscles. He also clearly describes exactly how to train if you want to build more endurance or enhance cardiovascular function. What's highly unique about Dr. Galpin and the information he teaches and the way he communicates that information is that he can take specific recommendations of how recreational exercises or even professional athletes ought to train for their specific goals. And link that to specific mechanisms that is the specific changes that need to occur in the nervous system and in muscle fibers. And indeed right down to the genetics of individual cells in your brain and body in order for those exercise adaptations to occur. It's truly rare to find somebody that can span so many different levels of analyses and who is able to communicate all those levels of understanding in such a clear and actionable way. Indeed Dr. Galpin is one of just a handful of people to which I and many others look when they want to make sure that the information that they're getting about exercise is gleaned from quality peer reviewed studies. Hands on experience with a wide variety of research subjects, meaning everyday people all the way up to professional athletes and a wide variety of sports. So it's no surprise that he's not only one of the most knowledgeable but also the most trusted voices in exercise science. Dr. Galpin is also an avid communicator of zero cost to consumer information about exercise science. You can find him on Instagram at Dr. Andy Galpin and also on Twitter at Dr. Andy Galpin. Both places he provides terrific information about recent studies both from his laboratory and from other laboratories more in depth protocols of the sort that you'll hear about today. So if you're not already following him, be sure to do so. He provides only the best information. He's extremely nuanced and precise and clear in delivering that information. I'm certain that by the end of today's conversation you'll come away with a tremendous amount of new knowledge that you can devote to your exercise pursuits. I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events this May. The first live event will be hosted in Seattle, Washington on May 17. Second live event will be hosted in Portland, Oregon on May 18. Both are part of a lecture series entitled The Brain Body Contract, during which I will discuss science and science-based tools for mental health, physical health and performance. I should point out that while some of the material I'll cover will overlap with information covered here on the human and lab podcast and on various social media posts. The first of the information I will cover is going to be distinct from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere. So once again, at Seattle on May 17, Portland on May 18, you can access tickets by going to cubrimanlab.com slash tour and I hope to see you there. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costs to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs. For any deficiencies that I might have, in addition, it has probiotics which are vital for microbiome health. I've done a couple of episodes now on the so-called gut microbiome and the ways in which the microbiome interacts with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood, and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body.

Thesis makes what are called Nutropics, which means smart drugs. Now to be honest, I am not a fan of the term, it's Nutropics. I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that I don't believe that there's any one substance or collection of substances that can make a smarter. I do believe based on science, however, that their particular neural circuits and brain functions that allow us to be more focused, more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera. It's just the way that the brain works. Different neural circuits for different brain states. And so the idea of a Nutropic that's just going to make a smarter all around fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things. Right? If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math, you're doing accounting, a different part of the day. You need to be creative. These are all different brain processes. Thesis understands this. And as far as I know that the first Nutropics company to create targeted Nutropics for specific outcomes. I use the highest quality ingredients, which of course is essential. Some of those I've talked about on the podcast things like DHA, Ginko, Bloba, Phosphatidal Serine. They give you the ability to try several different blends over the course of a month. Discover which Nutropics work best for your unique brain chemistry, genetics, and goals. And with that personalization, design a kit of Nutropics that's ideal for the different brain and body states you want to access. I've been using Thesis for more than six months now, and I can confidently say that they're Nutropics have been a total game changer.

And now for my discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin. Welcome, Dr. Professor Andy Galpin. It's been a long time coming. We have friends in common, but this is actually the first time we've sat down face to face. Yeah, I'm very excited. Yeah, there are only a handful meaning about three or four people who I trust enough in the exercise physiology space that when they speak, I not only listen, but I modify my protocols and you are among those three or four people. So, first of all, a debt of gratitude, thank you. You've greatly shaped the protocols that I use and I know there's far more for me and for others to learn. So, you're a professor, you teach in university, and you have a tremendous range of levels of exploration. Muscle biopsy, literally, images down the microscope all the way to training professional athletes and everything in between. So, you are truly an end of one, and just to start us off, I would love to have you share with us what you think most everybody or even everybody should know about principles of strength training, principles of endurance training and principles of, let's call it, let's call it, height, perchrophy, power and the other sort of categories of training. And this could be very top-con-toured, but what do you think everybody on planet earth should know about these categories of personal and athletic development? Well, that's a great first question. Holy cow, I think I'll start it this way. I tend to think about, there's about nine different adaptations you can get from exercise. Fat loss is not one of those, it is a byproduct, but that's not really what I'm getting at. And so we can kind of categorize everything like that, and what we're going to, we can talk about, or what are the concepts that you need to hit within each one, and then you could have infinite discussion of the different methodologies, right? And so that first thing to hit is the concepts are actually fairly few, but the methods are many, right? People have said that in iterations throughout time. So if you walked from the very beginning, the first one to think about is what we'll just call skill. This is improving anything from say a golf swing to a squatting technique to running. And this is simply moving mechanically how you want your body to move. I'm just going to globally call that skill. From there, we're going to get into speed. So this is moving as fast as possible. The next one is power, and power is a function of speed, but it's also a function of the next one, which is strength. So if you actually multiply strength by speed, you get power. And the reason I'm making this distinction, by the way, is some of these are very close, and I'm going in a specific order on purpose here. For example, power is, like I just said, it's a function of speed and strength. So if you improve speed, you've also likely improved power, but not necessarily, right? Because it could have come from the forced direction either. So there's carry over, so like the lot of things that you would do for development of strength and power. They are somewhat similar, but there's differences, right? And so things that you would do correctly for power would really not develop much strength and vice versa. So I'm going to get into all these details later. Once you get past strength, then the next one kind of down the list is hypertrophy. This is muscle size, right? Growing muscle masses, one way to think about it. After hypertrophy, you get into these categories of the next one is, these are all globally endurance based issues. And the very first one is called muscular endurance. So this is your ability to do how many pushups can you do in one minute, you know, things like that. Past muscular endurance, you're now into more of an energetic or even cardiovascular fatigue. So you've left the local muscle and you're now into the entire physiological system. And it's ability to produce and sustain work. And we can get it to a bunch of different variations with an endurance, but just to keep it really simple right now. The very first one, think about this as, I call this anaerobic power, right? So this is your ability to produce a lot of work for say 30 seconds to maybe one minute, kind of two minutes like that. The next one down then is more closely lined with what we call your VO2 max. So this is your ability to kind of do the same thing, but more of a time domain of say three to 12 minutes. So this is going to be a maximum heart rate, but it's going to be well past just max heart rate. Then after that, we have what I call long duration endurance. So this is your ability to sustain work. The time domain doesn't matter in terms of how fast going up you're going. It's how long can you sustain work. This is 30 plus minutes of no break like that. So as just an high level overview, those are the different things you can target. And again, some of those crossover and some are actually a little bit contrarian to the other one. So pushing towards one is maybe going to sacrifice something else. So as an overall start, that's really what we're looking at. Within all those though, they do have similar concepts. In terms of there's a handful of things you have got to do to make all of those things work. And we could talk about as many of those as you want. One of them is functionally called progressive overload. So whichever one you're trying to improve at, if you want to continue to improve, you have to have some method of overload. And as you well know, you've talked about a lot. Adaptation physiologically happens as a byproduct of stress. So you have to push your system. So if you continue to do to say the exact same workout over time, you better not expect much improvement. You can keep maintenance, but you're not going to be adding additional stress. So in general, you have to have some sort of progressive overload. And we can talk in detail about what that means for each category. But this could come from adding more weights. This could come from adding more repetitions. It could come from doing it more often in the week. It could come from adding complexity to the movement. So going from say a partial range of motion to a full range of motion or adding other variables. So there's a lot of different ways to progress. But you have to have some sort of movement forward. So if you have this kind of routine, we built Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or something. And you just do that infinitely. You're not going to get very far. So that's, I guess, the most high level overview of all the things people can go after. And then we can go from whatever direction you want from there. I'd love to do the deep dive on each one of these four several hours. But imagine that over time we probably will. I'd love to chat about a couple of these in a bit more depth. So in terms of defining what the progressive overload variables are for these different categories. Maybe we could hit the two most common combinations of these nine things. The first one being strength and high purtrophy. And maybe we could lump power in there. Maybe not you're the exercise physician. Yeah, it's a long journey. But strength and high purtrophy, which at least bears some relationship. Yeah. And then maybe separately we could explore sustained work endurance this 30 minutes or longer. Continuously because I think many people train in that regime. Yeah. And probably something like the VO2 max anaerobic as well because I know that a number of people now incorporate the so-called hit or high-intensied interval training. I think with the hopes of either shortening their workouts. Yeah. And or gaining some additional cardiovascular benefit. So if we could start with a strength and high purtrophy, I know many people want to be stronger. They want to grow larger muscles or at least maintain what they have. Yeah. So what are the progressive overload principles that are most effective over time for strength and high purtrophy? Yeah. a little step back with every one of those categories I talked about. You have what we call your modifyable variables. So this is a very short list of all the things you can modify the different variables within your work, that can be modified that will change the outcome. The fancy way of saying, if you do this differently, then you're going to get a different result. So modifyable variables, the very first one of those is called choice. So this is the exercise choice you select. Now, one of, I'm going to go double back here. So I'm kind of doing a little bit of inception. So follow me here as I'm going up a layer to come down a couple layers. I have these fundamental laws of strength conditioning that I'll kind of like a little bit of a joke. But progressive over those, one of those laws. Another one of those laws is your exercises themselves do not determine adaptations. So here's what I mean. If you're like, I want to get stronger. You can't select an exercise. That doesn't determine you getting strong. If you don't do the exercise correctly, and I'm not even referring to the technique, that of course matters. But if you don't execute it in the right fashion, then you're not going to get that adaptation. So if you choose, I want to get stronger. I'm going to do a bench press. Well, if you do the wrong set range, the wrong repetition range, the wrong speed. You won't get strength. You may be getting muscle endurance and very little strength adaptation. So the exercise selection itself is important, but it does not determine the outcome adaptation. So the very first thing you need to think about if you're like, I want to get stronger or add muscle. It's not the exercise choice. It is the application of the exercise. What are the sets? What are the reps? What are the rest ranges that you're using? That's going to be your primary determinant. Now some exercises are certainly better for some adaptations. For example, a deadlift is probably not a great exercise to do for long duration endurance. You could theoretically do 30 straight minutes of deadlifting, but it's probably not our best choice, right? It's probably a pretty good choice for strength development, because you're going to do a low repetition, high set range. You could theoretically do bicep curls for power, but probably not your best choice. So a single joint isolation movement is not the best for developing power, or you've ever done a bicep curls fast as you possibly can. That's not going to go well. So in theory, any exercise can produce any adaptation, given the execution is performed properly. So now that we've understood that a little bit, the exercise itself does not determine the adaptation. Coming within each one of these categories, exercise choice isn't important, variable, because it does lend you two things like what movement pattern you're in. So in other words, if you want to get stronger, and you're thinking, okay, what exercise do I do? You need to think a little bit about what muscle groups do I want to use, and that's going to be leading you towards the exercise choice. For example, I want to use my quads more. Okay, fine. Maybe you're going to choose more of a front squat type of variation, a goblet squat, so the bar, the load is in front of you. If you want to emphasize maybe more of your hamstrings and glutes, you're going to maybe put a barbell on your back or do a different one. So the exercise choice is important to the prescription, because it's going to determine a lot of your success. Okay, another kind of simpler way to think about this. If you were a beginner or moderate to intermediate, or maybe you don't have a coach, you probably want to hedge towards an exercise selection. That is a little bit easier technically. So you maybe don't want to do a barbell back squat. It's actually a pretty complicated movement. Maybe you want to do a little bit more of, again, a goblet squat, or even use some machines or a split squat, something that's a little bit simpler, because you don't have a coach, you're not a professional athlete. The likelihood of success is higher, and the risk is now gone lower. So the very first variable within all of these is the exercise choice. The second one is the intensity, and that refers to in this context, not perceived effort. Wow, that was a really intense workout. It is quite literally either a percentage of your 1-repant max, or a percentage of your maximum heart rate or a view of 2 max. So for the strength-based things, you want to think about what's percentage of the maximum weight I could lift one time, and that's what we're going to call 1-rep max. Or it's a percentage of my heart rate, right? So if I tell you to get on a bike and I want you to do intervals, and I want you to get 75%. I'm typically referring to 75% of your max heart rate, or if you do 2 max, or something like that. I tell you to do squats at 75%. That means 75% of the maximum amount of weight you could lift one time, or close. In terms of determining 1-rep max, I've never actually taken the 1-rep max for any exercise. But I have some internal sense of what that might be, or what range it might be. Is it necessary for people to assess their 1-rep-dition maximum, before going into these sorts of programs? No, not at all. I think a more intuitive way is to take a repetition range. Well, you could just do a couple different ways. So there are equations you can run, and you could just Google these anywhere, and these are called conversion charts. So it says, okay, if I did 75 pounds of my bench press, and I did it eight times, you can just run an estimate, and say, okay, you're probably going to be able to bench about 95 pounds for 1-rep max or something. So that's a very easy conversion chart. You just pick a low that you feel comfortable with, but it's kind of heavy, but not crazy heavy, and it was many repetitions that you can, want a really good technique, and then look what that number would be. So conversion rates are then doing one-rep-dition maximum. For the general public who has, again, no coaching, it's safer. For a professional athlete, it's not an easy safer, but, or I'm not even a professional athlete, but a trained person with a coach, but for most people, yeah, that's a good way to go about it. You can also just kind of do it with feel in the sense that, say you want to do a set of five repetitions, and you do the load, and you think, I cut it down one or two more. And then you kind of have an idea of what that number is going to be. If you think, man, that last one I had to kind of really, really, really get after it, then maybe just call that number, right? So you don't have to get overly concerned, in fact, when we start getting into these number ranges, you're going to see that they're all ranges. We're not going to give a specific 95% for one of these exact reasons. It's not that precise for most of them. In fact, some of them, like I perched, we have enormous ranges that you like almost can't miss. So the intensity in that case doesn't even matter for the most part, because that's not the primary determinant. Some of these you're going to see intensity as a determinant, and some of these you're going to see volume is a true determinant. So intensity, though, is a second one. Choice was the very first minute, the variable, intensity was the second one. The third one is what we call volume. And so this is just how many reps and how many sets are you doing? Right? So if you're going to do three sets of ten, that volume would be 30. Right? Five sets of five, that volume is 25. It's just a simple equation. How much work are you totally doing? The next one, pass that is called rest intervals. So this is about a time you're taking in between typically a set. Then from there you have progression, which is what we started to talk about this progressive overload, are you increasing by weight or reps or rest intervals or complexity? Or whatever. So all of those things can be changed as a method of progression. And so maybe you want to go progressing from a single joint exercise like a leg extension on a machine, and you want to progress by moving to a whole body movement like a squat. That and of itself you don't have to change the load or the reps or the rest. That is a representation of progressive overload. And it's probably a pretty good place to start because number one especially for beginners, you want to make sure that the movement pattern is correct. Don't worry about intensity, don't worry about rep ranges or any of these things. You need to learn to move correctly and you need to give your body some time to develop some tissue tolerance. So that you're not getting overtly sore. In general, soreness is a terrible proxy for exercise quality. It's a really bad way to estimate whether it was a good or a bad work. Especially for people in that beginner to middle to moderate. In fact, even the fat for our professional athletes, we do not use soreness as a metric of a good workout. It's a really bad idea for a bunch of reasons. On the same token because stress is required for adaptation. You don't want to leave with a gym, but feel like I don't really do much. There has to be there. So if you think about soreness on a scale of one to ten, you probably want to spend most of your time in like the three. You mean post-exercise. In between workouts. Totally. I know we'll talk about recovery extensively later. But if one body part or set of body parts is sore, is that an indication that one should stay out of training. I would imagine the answer is no. In most cases. And secondarily to that, if a particular muscle is sore, does that mean that muscle is not ready to be trained again? That's the answer to both those who are the same, which is no. You can certainly train a sore muscle. You need to, I guess, have a little bit of feel on that. So if you're sore of like, okay, like, and you're moving around a little bit, and you're like, man, this is a little bit sore, you can train. If you're like, I can't sit on the couch without crying, because my glutes are so sore. We probably don't need to train again. Does it mean we can't. Does it mean we can't. I'd say you've actually gone to the place of detriment. Because now you're going to have to skip a training session. And now you're behind. So you're actually total volume, say, across the month. It's actually going to be lower, because you went way too hard in those workouts. Had to take too many days off on between. You're going to see that you're going to cover less distance over the course of a month or six month, or even a year. So you want to walk a pretty fine line. And for most people, I would say, head a little bit on the side of less sore than more sore. Because frequency is very, very important for almost all these adaptations. It's training frequency, which is the last modified variable. Right? Frequency. Which is how many times per week are you doing that thing? So those are kind of our global things that we can play with. So when I'm trying to manipulate and get strength versus hypertrophy, or, you know what, I want a little bit of both, all those variables are the things that are going through my mind. Which one do I need to move in which direction so that I can get this outcome? And not this outcome over here. For example, some folks might want to get stronger, but not put muscle mass on. Some folks are just kind of want both. And that's a lot of general public. I want to get a little stronger and a little bit more muscle great. But there are instances where people for performance reasons, or for purely personal preference, like, I don't want to get any more muscle great. But I want to get stronger. Awesome. If you manipulate those variables correctly, you can get exactly that. Very little development of muscle size and a lot of development in strength. And this is why we continue to break world records and sports like power lifting and weightlifting that have weight classes. So there's a top number that we can hit in terms of body size, but yet we continue to get stronger and faster. So this is very possible if you understand how to manipulate all those variables. So that being said, we can start off with, you wanted to go strength. Yes, strength. And I love that you mentioned the fact that it is possible to increase strength without increasing muscle size, it's not dramatically because I think it's not just weight class athletes. I know a lot of people who, for aesthetic reasons, they'd like to be stronger. They're hearing that having strong bones and strong muscles and tendons. It's great for longevity and for avoiding injury and so many other features of life. And yet they don't want to fill out progressively larger and larger sizes of clothing. And we can go harder to the mechanisms on that piece if you want. We can save that, come back to it. Sure. Both. What I'd love to know, though, is if we could define some of these modifiable variables in the context of strength. So let's say, I, or somebody who, I come to you and I say, and let's just say for sake of a balance here because she actually does do some weight training. I bring my sister in and I say, me and my sister both want to get stronger. What modifiable variable should, how should we modify the variables? I love it. All right. Great. I'm going to do inception on you one more time. So one of my other laws of this will be fast. I promise of strength conditioning is in general. The default is all joints through all range of motion. So this is important because it's going to answer you very first question on this strength category. So in general, the ankles should go through the full range of motion. The ankle, the knees should go through the full range of motion. The knee, the hip, the elbow, et cetera, et cetera, right? Across the workout, not in a single movement. I would hope unless there's an amazing exercise I haven't heard of it. Well, there are some exercises that we're going to call more full body. Think about a full snatch. You're going to take a lot of your muscles. A lot of your joints through a lot of range of motions. Other ones like an isolation, we call these single joint exercises. So imagine a bicep curl. You have one joint in that particular case, the elbow moving. The shoulder and everything else is pretty much stable. This is how we differentiate, multi-joint from single joint movements. But yeah, so across, I would even say it doesn't even have to be the day, but maybe throughout the week, try to get every joint through full range of motion. Now, a couple of quick caveats that I'm not advocating using full range of motion and allowing really bad exercise technique. So when I say full range of motion, that's the default. That doesn't mean every single person can do that for every single exercise. It means that's where we should be striving to, and that's our starting point. You're going to see a lot less injury and a lot more productivity out of your training sessions. In fact, the science is fairly clear on this one. Strength development as well as high-purcharies generally enhanced with a larger range of motion of training. And the mechanisms are like somewhat understood on that. So that being said, if you have to get into, say, a bad position with your say low back. The spine is a very good one. You're in general, the spine should say it's very neutral, so we call it. So no, no flexion, no extension, especially in the Lumbar region. So if you're doing, say a deadlift, and in order to take your knee through a full range of motion, I deadlift, you have to compromise your back position. That's no bueno. So caveat, sir, aside, don't kill me. Like in good positions on me. Don't kill yourselves more importantly. So why that matters is if we walk through strength, the very first thing I'm going to go through is the exercise selection. So let's choose an exercise, which ideally has a full range of motion or close to it. That doesn't induce injury for you. You can still maintain good neck and low back and position in everything else. You feel comfortable with so you can feel strong, but you don't feel like, oh my gosh, if you've never snatched before, having you do a snatch for a maximum, even, you know, 75%. It's terrible idea. You're not going to feel confident. It's going to be a train wreck. I would rather put you on a machine bench press. See, even though I feel stable, I feel safe here, and I could just express my strength. So exercise choice in generally, in general, full range of motion, and you want to kind of balance between the movement areas. So this is an upper body press. So this is pushing away from you, bench press, things like that. Upper body pull, pulling an implement towards you, bent row, pull up. The pressing should be horizontal, so perpendicular to your body as well as vertical. So this is lifting away over top of your head. Lifting away away from you. The pull version is pulling horizontal to you and pulling vertically down, pull up things like that. From the lower body, we typically call these hinges. It's sort of a funny muscle thing that no one's going to laugh at, like maybe me and you here, is we'll categorize muscles as our movements exercises as pushers and pulls. Right? So like a squat is tends to be pushed because you're pushing away that ground. A deadlift is a pull because you're pulling the implement up to you. But in reality, every single exercise is only ever a pull because muscle doesn't push things away. Muscle can only contract and pull on itself. And so again, super dirty thing that like, muscle people are like, yeah. There was like that's so dumb. No, but I think it's a really important point because it also speaks to something. I think we'll get into later, which is that, you know, posterior chain anterior chain. And if that's mysterious to people, it'll become clear before long. Post your chain anterior chain makes a lot of sense to me because of the way it's grounded in the firing of motor neurons, which is ultimately what controls muscle. So it's also, I think there are a lot of times. Exactly. So it also depends on the lens through which one looks at life and exercise, of course, my lens is primarily neuroscience. So what I realized that the importance, I like this idea of pushing perpendicular to the body overhead, pulling both toward the body and from overhead. That just makes really good intuitive sense, especially since a lot of people were just listening to this and not watching it. So in your mind's folks, you can think about pushing away like a punch or overhead, like lifting something overhead, and then pulling toward your midline or toward your body rather, and then pulling yourself up like a pull-up in a PE class for those of you. So the lower body is the same thing, right? It's some sort of pushing away like a squat or a split squat or a lunge or something like that. And then some sort of again, what we'll call pull or hinge. So a deadlift or a Romanian deadlift or a hamstring curl or something where you're contracting and calling pulling the thing. And you could split these into like a thousand different categories. If you're really in that field, you're going to want to add a bunch of other ones. But that's just like a rough conception. So if you were going to do a single workout, you could choose four exercises. And you could choose one of each. One press upper body press, one upper body pull, one lower body hinge, one lower body press. And then that would be like a decently well-rounded exercise. That's your exercise selection. And if you're taking those three or four range of motion, you're going to pretty good spot. There's close to each again. The next one is intensity. So if you want to develop strength, this comes back to one of my favorite sciences of all the time. What happens to me in nerve guy actually? And generally I like to shoot on nerves as much as I possibly can because I'm a muscle guy. But I have to give Hennaman some credit here, right? And I know you know that is. Hennaman size principle. Yeah, of course, right? So this is a series of papers I think. And then it was a nature at least some of them. Yeah. And 1954, 56 or something. You can fact check me. I'm sure you will. But he basically outlined this idea that, okay, there's a certain recruitment threshold needed for neurons to fire. And we have muscle fibers in local fast, which muscle fibers in the social, which muscle fibers. And in general, you're going to activate the slow twitch on his first because they tend to be associated with low threshold. No, no, no, no, no. It's not exactly that way, but it's it's close enough, right? Well, the only way that you activate some of these higher threshold neurons is to demand the muscle to produce more force. And it's fairly specific to force, right? It's not something you can do over an endurance thing, right? Unless it gets really extreme and the take happens. So in general, the only way to use these big chunks of your muscle, which are incredibly important for aging, by the way, one of the major problems we have with aging, developing or development of aging related issues with muscle is the fact that we lose fast, which fibers preferentially. And then we have major problems as we go down the line because we've lost a big chunk of our strength inside. So you want to make sure these fibers stay alive and intact. Okay, so if that being said, the only way to develop strength is then to challenge the muscle to produce more total force. If you are fairly untrained or new, I guess I should have stated this all the beginning as well. One more inception that I'll stop. When it comes to this level of detail exercise prescription, a fairly untrained person is going to respond basically the same to every single thing you do. And in fact, we've done this in a lot of many times. We've done training studies doing things like 30 minutes of cycling and seeing huge increases in muscle strength in size, which is not a prescription for most people to use size, but people that are really untrained. If you did plial metrics or strength training or endurance running, they all just get better and everything. So that caveat kind of aside. If you want to be more intentional and more specific to the goal of strength, you need to produce more force, specificity matters, right? So we have size principle to help understand this. And we have more laws of specificity, which say, said principle, right? Specific adaptation to imposed demand. So the adaptation you get or the result of your training is going to be a reflection of the demand that you imposed. So if you want to get stronger, you need to impose a demand of strength, not repetitions. So this has to be the load has to be very high. In general, you're probably looking at above 85% of your one-ret max. If you're moderately trained, maybe 75% will work, lowly trained again, everything works. But in general, we want to be pressing a load. That's very high. So because the intensity demand is so high, that is going to force you to do a low repetition range. You can't do 12 reps at 95%. Then it wouldn't be 95% of your one-ret max. So by definition, true strength training is really going to be in like five repetitions per set or less range. That's where most of it's going to occur. Perspective efficiency. So we've covered choice intensity and repetitions, right? The total amount of sets that you do is really kind of up to your personal fitness level, right? If you did as little as like three sets, for exercise, that's probably enough. Work sets. Totally. Yeah, totally worksets, right? So get fully warmed up and build up to that 85%. Don't just walk into the gym and throw 85% on and go. Thank you. That's an important distinction. So work your way up, do some, like a very classic warm-up thing would be like a set of 10 at 50% a set of eight at 60% a set of maybe eight again at 70% and then maybe like a set of five at 75%. So two or three or four sets kind of building intensity and lowering the rep range and then you would go after your two or three working sets. And also in terms of rest intervals. Now because we're trying to the primary driver of strength is intensity. It's not the volume, right? It's the intensity. So in order to maintain that we have to do a low repetition range, but in addition, we also have to have a high rest interval. Because if we start to, if we have any amount of fatigue and occur and we have to then use or reduce the reps or reduce the intensity, we've lost the primary driver. We've lost that main signal. So the number we're going to throw out typically is like two to four minutes. So imagine you did, you know, you're set of bench press and you did five repetitions at 85%. You probably want to rest two to four minutes before coming back to the bench. That doesn't mean you have to sit there on your phone. Like, act fact, please don't. And I, everyone will thank you for not doing that. I promise. You can engage other muscle groups. This is what we call super setting. So you're doing your bench press and while that two minute clock is running for your chest to rest, you can go over and do your deadlifts. And so, you know, you can kind of move back and forth. And this is how you can make strength training, not seven hour workout. If you're professional out that you're going to take that time because you want to maximize the outcome. We've done this action. Our lab two super sets will reduce the strength gains, but by a tiny amount. And most of us don't care enough relative to it's going to triple the length of your training session. It's not worth it. So for the average person, I will tell them, yeah, super set for someone who's trying to break a world record and weightlifting or powerlifting, don't super set. Interesting. Yeah, I think I've found that I don't recover particularly well from strength and hypertrophy training. Like, I don't work out or the next. From workout to workout unless I keep the total duration of those workouts, I like to say no more than 60 minutes of work of real work. Yeah, maybe 75, past 75 I find that I just start to have to introduce additional rest days where I just get weaker over time. So I'd set a kind of a limit at 50 minutes and then I usually violate that limit and then up to 60 minutes. So I'm excited to hear that one can super set exercises as long as they work different muscle groups of course. Right. So I wouldn't want to do like bench press and overhead press super set because you're going to be good. I think that's just those without saying for most people, but just to point it out. But that I could do some push pull, push pull without compromising total intensity that much. And I certainly would be willing to give up a rep here or there are a few pounds here or there. And may ask whether or not in doing that one gets any even tiny bit or more of additional benefit in terms of cardiovascular work because I imagine after all, even a one rep max, which I've never done it as I mentioned, but let's say I get three reps on the overhead press and then I get four reps on a weighted pull up and going back and forth. I'm no doubt going to be breathing harder than if I was sitting there texting away on my phone in between sets. Yeah, of course. And so in fact, in general, one of the things that I'll present on my class is a giant list of, in fact, on the top is all of these different exercises adaptations I started the conversation with. And on the vertical column are as many of the physiological potential adaptations one would get. So changes in endogenous pH, blood pressure, lymphatic changes, bone density, all these things, right, and just have this checklist. And then you can run a matrix and you can start to look at, okay, if I do speed training and my going to see changes in the nervous system will like very much so, right, that's the primary actually reason those things work. Very little change in the muscle system, it's almost exclusively explained by the central or peripheral nervous system, right. On that same token, are you going to expect many cardiovascular adaptation from speed? And that's just no because, although we didn't cover it, speed is very low intensity, very low rep range, very high rest. Well, as you go to like strength, and then you go to high hypertrophy, you start seeing more and more increases in cardiovascular adaptations because you're doing exactly that, right, you're starting to reduce rest and you're starting to increase volume. But you're going to lose things like bone mineral adaptations because the loads are to go down. So you can look at this matrix and kind of understand if I'm a person who wants to kind of maximize the adaptations, I get across my entire physiology for the least amount of work. You can choose these different adaptations to go after that are going to kind of land on these things, right. And exactly as you mentioned, if you're going to take five minutes for us between each rep. So let's say the extreme, you're going to do three sets of one repetition for strength at 95%. You're going to take probably five, maybe seven minutes between each attempt. If you better not expect many changes in your resting blood pressure, there's no cardiovascular strain there. You're going to put it together in a circuit, we're going to lose some potential strength adaptation, but you're going to gain something there. So all these things are, it's not about good or bad or right or wrong, it's always about what advantaged you want, what disadvantage, the you want. And I can cut like really into the chase here on one of these things because we'll get this eventually. If you want to know the ones that are going to generally give you the most physiologic adaptations across the most categories, you're almost always looking for a perchpy type of training. And then this anaerobic conditioning piece will get into that's going to hit the most systems at once. That's great to know and we should definitely go a little bit deeper on those types of what the modifiable variables are for those categories because I think that I'm guessing the vast majority of people want to be a bit stronger, maybe add some a little bit of muscle or more. Get make sure their heart is healthy and et cetera. This is wonderful and I think it's clarifying certainly a lot for me. So for strength let's I guess training frequency. So what should determine training frequency and I had the great benefit of the long time ago when I was in high school actually I paid for a session over the phone with Mike Menser. You know, he Mike Menser. We got to be friends. I'm 10 times training. At the time I was pretty young and my mother kept saying, why is this like grown man calling the house? And we would talk all the time about training but he tried to convince me to train once every five to seven days. Very few sets, very high intensity and I must say it worked incredibly well. Sure. I think with my recovery quotient which was not very good. I think has improved over time but it was not very good. It was remarkable. But of course this was a time when I was full of the most animals. And I was able to see if there was a lot of my own version of animal ox right? I was really had a long arc of puberty. You were untrained. And I was mostly untrained. I've been running across countries and skateboarding and playing soccer. And doing all the things that are like the antithesis of growth. It was literally and people will probably say impossible. It was something like 40 pounds of muscle inside of 12 months. It was crazy. I wouldn't believe it. But and so then of course that stopped working over time. And then you start going down the the Odyssey of trying to find the thing that's going to work that well and you eventually realize that it was because you were untrained. So training frequency is crucial. Let's say that people are doing these whole body workouts as you described them. Not alternating upper body lower body because there's so many different splits that we've talked about. Doesn't probably doesn't make sense to go into splits right now. But how often can can and should one train a muscle? And how do you know if a muscle is recovered locally? And how do you know if your nervous system is recovered systemically? This is a bunch of really interesting questions. I'm not sure exactly what right you want to go. So I'll start here. As I mentioned earlier, Sornus is not a good barometer of exercise quality because some types of training are going to induce more sornus than some are going to induce less. That's important to this conversation because when you ask about how do you know if a muscle is ready to train again. One of the questions is what are you training for? If you're training for hypertrophy right muscle size muscle growth. We need to head towards recovery because what you're trying to do is cause a massive impact. If you're doing a lot of things that you're doing in a lot of different ways. If you're doing a lot of things that you're doing in a lot of different ways, you're going to do is cause a massive insult there. Allow then protein synthesis to occur building a new tissue which takes time. 48 to 72 hours, like kind of out of minimum. That process needs to occur. If you're doing actually more strength and this is a different ratio between hypertrophy and strength. Then you didn't induce actually much damage. In fact, you're generally not going to get very sore from true strength training. Very little. Not the same primary driver of strength. We talked about that already. That's intensity driven for for hypertrophy. It's not intensity. So because we have different mechanisms, we have different outcomes. Even though they're closely aligned, strength is not going to cause a lot of soreness. Therefore, intensity is the driver. Therefore, frequency can be as high as you want. So you can train every single day. The same exact muscle if speed or power or strength are the primary training. Training tools because you need stimulus. There's skills skills as well, right? Practice. That you know that as much as anybody. Developing a new motor pattern requires a lot of repetitions, right? You don't need a tremendous amount of rest. That's not a damaged thing, right? It's a repaturing issue. So strength training. In fact, if you look at, again, true strength professional athletes, they're going to train the same muscles basically every day. Wow. Yeah. And is that because the primary mode of adaptation is recruitment of these high threshold motor units? So it's mainly neural. No. So everyone's going to say that. And this is where I get all feisty. Well, I'm not saying that. That was actually there was a question mark. Okay. If we were online putting comments, there would be a question mark. We would have fought. I would have blocked you. I'll just kick. That's how you are ready, well. No. Probably twice. Okay. The early adaptations to exercise a special strength training are hedged towards the nervous system. No question about it. People always say, such an nervous system, but it's probably more peripheral. Whatever. Semantics, probably. But pedantic. It's nerve. If you train two day to more more, and you're not going to wake up with a actually increase in contract on proteins and muscle. Your muscle might be a little bit bigger, do to some acute swelling. But you could have an, and pretty acute that persists change and the nervous system will call it that allows you to be stronger like within a couple of days. Sustain high-perch fee is probably more along the lines of four weeks. Or we can see that, right? We can actually see changes like in the ultrasound. Now, you're making changes immediately. That protein synthesis process is happening like very fast. And it's going to blast. It takes us time to measure it in terms of a noticeable change in your whole muscle's size. So that being said, the first four weeks we typically say are primarily nervous system. After that, now we're seeing starting to see most of the changes coming from the muscle's side of the equation. So, with strength development, it's a combination of three areas. In fact, all muscle contraction has these same three things. It starts off with some signal, right? From somewhere in the body, whether it's all the way up the top or at the level of the spine depending on if this is a reaction or an actual conscious control. From there, that some signal has to tell the muscle to contract. So, signal is one. Two, it's muscular contraction. There's a lot of variables inside the muscle tissue itself that determine its functionality. And so, if we took an individual biopsy and took a muscle fiber from you and took one from me, and we took those muscles out and put them in a petri dish. And I tied one into a four-strand stucer and the other end to a thing that pulls it. And we soaked it in a bath of calcium and a bunch of other stuff. Even if they were the same size, your fibers might contract a lot faster than mine, even relative to size. Or not, our slower, or there's various properties. So, the intrinsic fibers themselves determine a lot of functionality. From there, muscle fibers don't cause movements. Muscle fibers simply contract. They're all surrounded with connected tissue. And that's all surrounded with a bunch of more connected tissue. And that all surrounded to a muscle. That muscle is in surrounded with more connected tissue. That all comes together into a giant tendon that tendons attached to the bone. It's pulling on those tendon that actually move the bone to cause human movement. So, that's area three. Area one, the nervous system area two, the muscle contraction area three, some sort of connective tissue thing. Change has happened at all three of those levels. And we're not even now talking, we even entered the discussion of biomechanics. And you changed, say the panache and angle of the muscle, which is the angle at which the muscle fibers lay relative to the bone. So, this is basic mechanics, as it pulling perpendicular to the bone, as it pulling horizontal to the bone or some sort of angle. All of these things determine human performance. So, when you're talking about again that strength development, you can see tremendous improvements in total force production by manipulating all of those areas. And you have not touched changes in muscle size. If you change muscle size in a true sustained fashion, whether this is circumplasmic or to contractal proteins, you have given yourself more opportunity to produce some more force. It doesn't guarantee you produce more force. Bodybuilders are not stronger than power-lipters, even though they have more muscle. But bodybuilders are probably stronger than most people. So, there is a relationship between muscle size and strength. It's not a one-to-one guarantee ratio. And that's generally because the, although the muscle has been aided, they may have not changed the bone mechanical considerations. They may have not changed the connected tissue, nor the nervous system stuff. And so that's why we see this giant relationship. That R value is pretty high between strength and hypertrophy. But if you really want to get to the ends of it, it's not. And that matters to your actual question 10 minutes ago. Because again, you can train strength daily on the same muscle. But if you want to allow for that process of connect a contractal proteins to add and grow, then you're going to have to allow some recovery. Because if you go back into that muscle too soon, you're going to blunt the response you're going to stop it. You're going to cut it off. You have all kinds of problems going on in the cell that are going to just attenuate that growth response. So I gave you the answer for strength training. The answer for hypertrophy is probably less than 3 out of 10 on level of sornas, so you can go again. In general, you're probably looking at 72 hours. Is the optimal window. So if you trained your, your shoulders on Monday, you probably wouldn't want to train him again on Tuesday. If I purchase the goal, maybe Wednesday, maybe Thursday's best. So something like an every 2 to 3 day window is probably, and we know a little bit more now about why that is. The gene cascade, the signaling response happens. Well, the signaling happens instantaneously, right? Within seconds, the gene cascade is probably in the peak to the four hour window, like the depending on which gene you want to look at. But this is kind of a snapshot. But the protein synthesis process is 24 to 48 hour thing. And so it tends to kind of look like let that thing finish and let that signal go back to baseline and then hit it again. And then hit it again. And now as long as you're providing the nutrients, the recovery should happen. And you should be able to sustain the same work output in the training session. So the stimulus stays high. And the recovery's there, and you can now continue to grow muscle. You mentioned 48 to 72 hours for hypertrophy. What if, before whatever reason. The training split lifestyle factors, et cetera, somebody say let's use your example trends, shoulders on Monday. Ideally, they would train them again on Thursday in their particular instance. Somewhere, when's air Thursday? But they don't. They wait until Saturday or Sunday for whatever reason. Maybe it's more compatible with their work work and other exercise schedule. Whatever the reason. Are they actually losing hypertrophy that they gain in the same way? Or they missed a window to induce further hypertrophy. It's probably better to think about it the latter. It's not that you've lost. It's just you've just kind of lost an opportunity to make more progress. I will save you a little bit and kind of going back to your hit program. This is the original high intensity training, the men's or thing, right? Which is not. The hit with one eye, not the high intensity interval training, but high intensity training. The one set to absolute failure. Maybe two for each muscle group. Twenty minute workouts. Dividing your body into three and two at three ways. And then literally training like... Six times a month. Which most people think that is absolutely crazy. There's no way that's going to work and I can tell you. If you are untrained, you grow like a weed. Just if you train hard enough. Even if you're trained, look at the people who might train. He put a lot of bodybuilders on really high levels. Now they had the same similar help you had at that time frame. To be very clear, I was not taking an exogenous antibiotics. In fact, I was just as good. I probably was. I wasn't measuring my levels there, but I probably would. I grew easy. And in general, I tend to grow pretty easily from weight training. But the... But and I should say that Mike's credit and I think this is an important message. That he was the one who really said, Look, unless you're going to make a professional career out of it, do not run the health hazards of exogenous hormones. It's certainly not at your age. So he deterred me from that, which was great because it never entered my mind. It just was one of those things where Mike Mensers said, Don't do it and he had clearly done it. Right. And so he's speaking from an informed place. It never entered my mind. But also, I was really wild as I was continuing to run across country. And so there was a trade off there at some point. A bit of an arena. Or when you're young, you can get many people can get away with what This age would surely place me into a state of overtraining, even at low volume. Well, I mean, like the whole field on interference effect has changed quite a bit. Recently, which we can come back to if you want. But just to finish out the idea here with that last question. If you want to take five days or six days in between each muscle group, you can do that. In fact, if you look at the research, it's going to show that frequency is not that important. It will... It's not that it's not important. But it's... It can handle changes. As long as you get to the same total volume. So you can do that. You just have to do a lot more work in that one workout. If you care about the six week eight week thing. If you're like, I'm in this for the next 60 years. Like, it's probably okay, right? But it can be there that the challenge with splitting up your training sessions for Imperrophy and the smaller numbers, like once or twice a week, it's just difficult to get that number. It's difficult to get that volume done. Volume wise, the more recent meta-analysis, you're going to say that you're probably looking at around ten working sets per muscle group per week. Seems to be kind of the minimum threshold that you're going to want to hit. So if you did three sets of ten at your shoulders on Monday, three sets of ten shoulders, Wednesday and three on Friday. That's nine working sets. If you wanted to do three different shoulder work exercises on Monday and hit your nine sets, it's not really actually going to be that much different. The problem is, ten is kind of the minimum. You probably want to look for more like 15 to 20. And in fact, well trained folks, 20, 25. That becomes very challenging in one workout. In fact, the funcler, you're not going to be able to do it, right? And so that is where it's not frequency that looks like it kills you. You've got to get because the total driver of strength is intensity, but the total driver of hyperchv is volume. Assume you're taking it to fatigue, right? Or meskender failure. So it's just tough to get enough done. If you can, and if you want to set your schedule up that way, like you probably remember, if you do those types of training sessions, where you're just going to completely exhaust a muscle, it's going to be sore for a while. You're probably not going to come back. And that's sore the logic behind that was let's take this thing to tremendous failure. And give it six days to recover. It can work. It's just not the best. I think it's one way to think about it. For most people. It's also hard to do those workouts without a training partner. If you really want to do them correctly. And stimulants and headphones and all kinds of others. Yeah, well, anyway, the stimulants are not. I don't certainly don't recommend those. Yeah. Maybe a cup of coffee or two if that's your thing. But, and maybe some of the safer supplements, but certainly not sorts of stimulants that the guys in the 70s and 80s or still use. Or still use. You talked about repetition ranges broadly for strength training. So fiber less. Yep. You said frequency could be as often as everyday. Yeah. Rest two to four minutes. Maybe even longer if you're going for one repetition maximum. Yeah. For hypertrophy. Sure. What are the repetition ranges that are effective? And what are the ones that are most effective if one is trying to maximize some of the other variables? Like people don't want to spend more than an hour to 75. It's in the gym because I think that while the range is might be quite broad as you alluded to earlier, there's the practical, there are the practical constraints. Yeah. So what repetition ranges or a percent of one repetition maximum, should people consider when thinking about hypertrophy? Right. The quick answer there is anywhere between like five to 30 reps per set. That's going to show across literature pretty much equal average for the first time. And we can have a really interesting discussion about why that is. But I'm just remembering one thing from a second ago. I want to give a better answer for the frequency. You can do every single week for strength or every single day for strength. If you want though like what's probably minimally viable too. Twice for week per muscle. So hamstrings. Strength. Twice for week. That's a good number to get most people really strong. Okay. You can do every single day. You don't need to though. So I want to make sure that like I wasn't saying you have to train a muscle. 85% every single day to get strong. Two is a good number. Three is great. But probably even two is really effective. Got it. This explains the high frequency of training for strength athletes. That's always mystified me. Yeah. And the very long workout to make sense because very long. They're going to even train twice a day. Even though it's squat. And the morning squat and the afternoon. With their eating and they're sleeping. They probably don't have time for anything else. That's why they're pros. So that's a job. That's what they do. So yeah. Your hypertrophy. Strength training programming. It is somewhat complicated. Right? Because of that's not the danger. But you're going to have to pay one way or the other. The risk is a little bit higher because of low tire and you have to be a little more Tectically proficient. When it comes to hypertrophy training, the way I like to explain it is it's kind of idiot proof. The programming is idiot proof. The work is hard though. So you're here's your range anywhere between five reps and 30. Can you hit somewhere in there? Perfect. It's all equally effective. You can't screw that up. The only caveat for hypertrophy is you have to take it to muscular failure. And you need enough rest for the adaptation in protein synthesis. It's a curve. Yep. And if you recover faster, you can maybe do it more frequently. And if you don't, maybe less frequently. But that logic should people perhaps experiment and figure out what repetition range allows them to recover in concert with the training frequency that they can do consistently. The recommendation is I think you should actually set your use the repetition range as a way to have some variation because most people don't want to go in the gym to do three sets ten. They're going to get very bored very quickly. And so I think you should actually intentionally change the reps schemes for simple sake of having more fun. It is a very different challenge. The mechanisms that are inducing hypertrophy are different. But there's only a maximum amount of growth that one can get. So you have as best we think it now. And some people actually will dispouse that we know really clearly about the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy we don't. It's still very much a guessing game. But the three most likely drivers are one metabolic stress, two mechanical tension, and then three muscular damage. You don't have to have all three. One is sufficient. You can have a little bit of one or two and you can kind of see you get it to play here. We've already talked about the muscular damage. Again, it's very clear. More damage is not better. But it is somewhat decent proxy, right? Like I've got a little bit of soreness. It's good. You don't get so sore. It's compromising your total volume. Mechanical tension is kind of like strength. This is why if you do even set to five or eight and you're kind of close to that strength range. You will gain a little bit of muscle. Not optimal muscle gain, but you're going to gain some because everything in these physiologists and cut off a four reps and then five reps is a different thing. It's always a blend. So think of it as like a fading curve. And you get closer to the end. It fades less effective as you get closer to the middle. It's more effective. Anywhere between eight reps per set to 30, it's equally effective. Past 30, it's going to blend out past eight to five to four to three. It's going to blend. You know, less or there. So metabolic stress is one. The damage is the other. Sorry, mechanical tension is the one that's heavy. Muscle damage is the one. The third one is metabolic stress and this is a get a bit of an area of science of a contention, but something's there. I know if something's there. We're just kind of fumbling to figure out what exactly it is. And this is metabolic stress is the burn, right? It's there. It's why blood flow restriction training probably works. That's done very light. So there's no mechanical tension. There's very little damage. But somehow it induces a good amount of hypertrophy. Very painful. You'll be a boy. I tried this. I have a friend former special operator who was on the East Coast and took me through a blood flow restriction training protocol in the park. I don't think I actually cried. But you probably did. But I might have cried out once or twice. It was unbelievable, especially the lower body movements. Yes. Now, it was a humid day. I'll clean my little bit of jelly. But it was brutal. It was really brutal. And I also do it on the best year of life and it's still brutal. Okay. Well, that makes me feel a little bit better. It was intense. And people should know that it is important to use the proper cuffs for these things. I don't have any relationship training that companies that sell these cuffs. But the reason is that you actually need to block particular avenues of blood flow. You can't simply cinch off a muscle. You can't turn a get a muscle in train. You can actually kill yourself that way. Yeah, you can get a blood clot. Yeah. And so if you're interested in blood flow restriction training, I imagine you have some content about this or will at some point. But also there are resources online that people can go out. Yeah. A question about hypertrophy training that I think many people are wondering about train to failure or don't train to failure. Assuming good form. Yeah. Okay. Assuming good form. Great. The answer is both. So you want to train to failure. But you don't need to go to extreme failure. So you don't need to necessarily go to that like a partner has to lift the barbell off my chest. But you have to get close. You have to drive either heavy, stress, damage, or pump. And so I really easy practical way to think about this. I heard Mike Isrtele runs a company called Redisnospirization years ago, outlined this in a NSA talk. And it was beautiful. And I thought this is the most eloquent way to explain the context about training hypertrophy. So I want to look for three things in your workout. And let's say that you have a particular muscle to grow. Let's say you want your glutes to get larger. Okay. When you're doing your glute exercises, number one, are you feeling the glute contract? Okay. Doesn't have to be there, but that's a good sign if it is. Okay. Let's say I didn't really feel my glute contract. I felt it more of my quads or my back. Okay. Did you feel a big pump afterwards? Now I didn't really feel a pump there either words or during. Okay. Great. Number three. Next day. Did you feel a little bit of soreness there at all? No. Didn't feel it during the workout. You felt no sort of pump and it didn't get sore. Don't expect much growth. Didn't have. You contributed the work across a bunch of muscle groups. Most likely other muscle groups were tuned involved, right? Especially if you're like, no, but man, my back got really stuck. Well, that's a really good indication of telling you what the hell was moving. And so in terms of targets, if you were to put, I'm going to wonder, you know, 10 scale. How much should I feel it burning during? Anything less than a three. Okay. It's probably not doing much, right? But it doesn't, like, seven is not, a 10 is not better than seven. You need to feel it, but it doesn't have to be like, oh, my gosh, I'm dying here. Soreness same barometer, right? So if you can get like three, three and three, you're probably in a pretty good spot. Five, five and five is maybe better. But you don't need to go much past that. So I want you to feel the muscle group either working or if you're like, I didn't feel it much. I need really get a pump at the next day. I got really sore. Then you're still, you know, going on a good path. Again, really sore isn't like, whoo, a little tender, but next day it's okay. They have to that. I could train no problem. That's really what you want to go after. And in terms of understanding, is this likely to produce some growth or not? Excellent, excellent. Very clear parameters and recommendations. I know are benefiting me and we've benefited a lot of people. If you be willing to throw out a few sort of sets and rep parameters that could act as broad guidelines for people who want to. I don't know if that's what we're going to do. I've got people who want to explore further. I realized that with all these modifiable variables that there's no one size fits all four strength. I love this five to 30 for hypertrophy that people. I don't think I've ever done a 30 rep set of anything, but but now that you throw that out there, I see it as a bit of a. Do you want to know what's awesome about 30? You're going to get an insane pump. You're going to burn like crazy, but you won't get super sore. Because I'm kind of a tension. You're going to get a lot of light. So you can you can get away with those things and you it's hard because your mind is going to wander. You're going to get it like rep 20. You're going to make up done and you're like, no, there's a lot left here to get the 30. Where like I said a 10 is much easier. Like you just like, okay, two more, two more. Set of 30's like I got 16 more. It's awful, but you're just accounting is worth. It's terrible, right? And people tend to just kind of like check out. So 30's possible, but a little bit extreme extreme. But I would recommend them all of them. It's a really fun play. You can do different in the same workout too, by the way. Like you could do one set of 10 pushups and then take a little break and then do a set of 25. You can mix and match these things. There's no magic recipe that has to happen for all those or do it different. So Mondays are my sets of 10 days. Wednesdays are my set of 20 days and Fridays are my set of 30 days. And you can have all kinds of fun there and it's hard to screw up. Great. I love that phrase. There's always reassuring. So for strength is there are sets and reps protocol that is a lot of different things. Yeah, that is pretty sure fire. So a way to just think about a really fast answer for power. We'll speed power and strength is what I just called the 3 to 5 concept. Alright, so pick 3 to 5 exercises. If you're feeling better that day, choose on the higher end. If you're feeling less that day or you have a shorter time frame to train, go less. So this would be three sets or three exercises or other or five exercises most. So 3 to 5 exercises. Do 3 to 5 reps. 3 to 5 sets. Take 3 to 5 minutes rest in between and do it 3 to 5 times a week. So that can be as little as 3 sets of 3 for 3 exercises 3 times a week. That's a 20 minute workout 3 times a week. It can be as high as 5 sets of 5 for 5 exercises 5 days a week. So it's very broad and allows people to still stay within the domains of strength and power. While still being able to move and contour toward their lifestyle and soreness and time and all those things. The only differentiator to pay attention to between power and strength is intensity. So if you want strength, this is now 85% plus of your max, right? If you want power, it needs to be a lot lighter because you need to move more towards the velocity and to the spectrum. Because power is strength multiplied by speed. So while getting stronger by definition can help power, you probably want to spend more of your time in the 40% to 70% range, like plus or minus. So that's it. Both of them conceptually will work everything else. The exercise, the reps, the frequency, all that can be still in the 3 to 5 range. Just changing intensity depending on which outcome you want. The nervous system obviously plays an important role at the level of nerves controlling the contraction of muscle fibers. But of course we have these upper motor neurons, which are the ones that reside in our brain that control the lower motor runs that control muscle. And this takes us into the realm of where the mind is at during a particular movement. And to me this is not an abstract thing. I can imagine doing workouts that are mainly focused on strength or mainly focused on hypertrophy. And in the case of strength am I trying to move weights and when I'm trying to generate hypertrophy am I trying to quote unquote challenge muscles. In other words, if I just trying to move a weight away from my body, you know, pushing a bench press or an overhead press. I don't know that I want my mind thinking about the contraction of my medial delts. I think I want my mind in getting the weight overhead with the best proper form. And certainly with hypertrophy training, best in proper form is going to be the target as well. But that simple or I should say subtle mental shift changes the patterns of nerve fiber recruitment. So can we say to get stronger focus on moving weights still with proper form and safely? And to get hypertrophy focused on challenging muscles still with proper form and safely. It's very fair. Yeah, as a snapshot answer, it is a very fair thing to think about. Intentionality matters for both. In other words, if you look at some interesting sciences been done on power development and speed development. The intent to move is actually more important than the actual movement velocity. So if you're doing say something for power or strength and you're doing just enough to get the bar up. That will result in less improvements in strength than even if you're moving at the exact same speed but you're intending to move faster. And this is one of the reasons why good coaching matters. So if you're coaching an athlete through a power workout especially and they're doing enough to just lift 50% of their one right max. It's not going to generate as much speed development as them trying to move that bar as fast as they can. Even if the net result is the same barbob velocity. It turns out nerves matter. I mean, I was about to say amazing but it's a neuroscientist if I say amazing that nerves matter. What's amazing to me is what if I understand correctly what you're saying is that. Even if the bar is moving at the same speed. Same way. Yeah. If my internal representation, my thoughts are I'm trying to move this as fast as possible versus I'm just trying to get the bar away from me. And get the way up. I'm going to get different outcomes. This is quality of work, right? This is, did you do enough to just check off the box or did you actually strive for. Adaptation, right? Similar concept actually works right. Perchography in terms of there is a handful of very recent studies that have looked at what will call the mind muscle connection. And this is doing things like imagine a bicep curl. And you're simply looking at and watching your biceps and you're thinking about contracting it harder. Even though you execute the same repetitions at the same exact intensity. And initial indications are the mind body connection are going to result in more growth than not. You just gave authorization for people to look at their muscles contracting in the gym. Please do. Yeah. Of course, right? But the selfie is still ruled out. I'd rather you look at your muscles in your phone. So I'm fine with that. Those are initial. We don't have a large depth of research to support that. Maybe some stuff will come in counter. But it does it matches what folks in that community have been saying for a very long time. Right? There's actually some stuff on simply flexing in between. So if you've ever seen a bodybuilder, they'll do their set of bicep curls and then they'll get out and they'll flex and they'll check. And they're literally, this is what Arnold did, right? This is if you go back to pumping an iron. Or college weight rooms, I wouldn't say. Right. For some reason, there's something about that age group. Yeah. There's a lot of checking of biceps in college weight rooms for reasons that escape me. If you ever interact with my wife, she will be the first to tell you, I cannot walk past a mirror without checking something out. You can't. I can't. I can't. Not hurt me. I'm going to cannot walk. Well, that'll be careful not to disparage that. It has nothing to do with the hypertrophy, but I'm a muscle guy. So I'm always thinking and tinkering or whatever. Yeah, it is, I think it's very much worth your time to do a higher quality training session. Be more intentional. Be present. Then just executing the same as I've worked out. I think that's globally very clear to be to your advantage. So if you're thinking, like, I'm going to, like, I don't want to work out today. I got all this going on or I'm tired or whatever. I'm just going to do the workout. Anyways, get through it. Okay. If you can go, you know what though? Like, I'm going to cut 15 minutes out of this thing. I'm going to get my head right. I'm going to go to 20 minutes of quality work done. That's, that's your best option by far. You alluded to the fact that even just looking at a particular muscle, my benefit in terms of the number of fibers you can recruit or it's potential for hypertrophy. I've heard before and I certainly have experienced that muscles that for whatever reason, genetics or sports that one played, et cetera. Muscles that we find that we can contract to the point of almost a slightly painful contraction, seem to grow more readily than muscles that we can't recruit very easily. And there, and the reason I mentioned sports that we played earlier is I've been, you just have to watch the Olympics to see that, you know, swimmers obviously are very good at engaging their lats. You look at the gymnasts they seem to be very good at engaging everything. And they go through a huge number of different dynamic movements that explains that. So I find that, you know, if people say, oh, you know, I can't get stronger in this or my, whatever body part is weak in terms of its inability to engage hypertrophy. Yeah, I see that. That oftentimes that can be because of an inability to to engage those upper motor neurons to deliberately isolate those muscles. Are there ways that people can learn to engage particular muscle groups more effectively over time for sake of hypertrophy or strength or for cases of trying to overcome injury potential or injury because imbalance of the bad across the board. Yeah, this is actually very common and I think everyone is probably going to this. There's some part that you just can't get going for me. That was the lats. That was a rhomboid. So my back muscles for years. I couldn't activate my lats or my rhomboid. See, the muscle groups that connect your shoulder blades. So if you try to squeeze your shoulder blades together, that set of muscles there. Called your rhomboids. Your lats, of course, are more vertical and pull you kind of up and down. And no matter how many lap pull downs I did, bent rows, pull ups. I could never see any development there. No increase in strength. And it took me probably a decade to figure out how the hell to actually get these things on. In fact, if you would have asked me even in my college years as a college football player, Hey, flex your lats. Show me your lats. You would have seen no movement there. When I was doing a pull-up in that particular case, the only way I could get the bar to move was by using my biceps. So it's a synergizing muscle. It's supposed to be a secondary tertiary muscle in that movement. But for me, it was primer because of my over strength in my biceps, coupled with my lack of activation in the lats. So you're compensating the same movement. Actually, kind of an easy way to think about this is imagine doing a bent row. So imagine your bent over, kind of at a 45 degree or a horizontal angle. And you're going to pull a barbell to your belly button. And now you can actually do that exact same movement with very little back muscle activation by simply flexing your elbows more. And so you think the barbell is going all the way down is coming all the way up to touching my belly. And you think you're doing a great back development exercise. When in fact, because of the way that you're executing the movement, you're getting very little back development. And this is a really good example of why someone has done a specific exercise many, many, many times, but yet failed to see development in a muscle group. And it goes back to earlier part of our conversation, which is why exercises themselves do not determine the adaptation. It's the execution that matters, right? It's the technique, it's the rep range, all of those are going to determine your actual result. So if any time you're you're banging your head against the wall and thinking like, why am I not getting movement here, growth or strength or whatever, it's almost one of those, it's guaranteed to be one of those areas, right? You're probably not getting the muscle groups to activate. In that particular example, just because we're here, try imagine doing that bent row. Instead of pulling the barbell to your belly, squeeze your shoulder blades together first, as far as they can possibly go. And then bring your elbows up without changing the angle of your elbow. So in other words, without bringing your hand closer to your shoulder, so keep that same angle and come up as high as you possibly can, and then finish out the movement. That's going to guarantee a utilization first of the back muscles and a finishing with the biceps. At the end, which is how that movement is supposed to go. So how do you coach into that? Well, it can be a number of things. Whenever I'm diagnosing movement quality, I look for a handful of things, but very first one is awareness. You'd be surprised how many folks, when you just simply tell them, that muscle group right there and maybe you give them a tactical prompt, so you touch it. Or you put something against it. This is actually why, sorry, I'm jumping over the post, but this is why things like a belt work very well for actually increasing abdominal strength. So a misconception out there is if you wear like a belt when you're lifting, then the belt kind of does all the work for you and your abs get weaker. That can happen, but the exact opposite can happen as well. So if you take a belt for example, and you cinch it down really tight, and then you just completely disregard your midsection. You will see a loss of strength in your midsection because not a belt is doing the work. But if you put the belt on just a little bit, kind of tight, to where you get some sensory feedback, and you think about using that belt as a way to activate the core muscature. You will actually see a higher, and if we look at like EMG activation, the core muscles would be activated higher to a greater extent than when the belt is off. Because of proper receptive feedback. 100% and for those that are wondering what proprioceptive feedback is, their nerves that extend out to the muscles that control muscle contractions, but then their sensory inputs from the skin and muscle that go back into the nervous system and those work in concert. And that feedback is proprioceptive. I think it literally translates to a knowledge of where one's limbs are and what's happening on those. In the space. I've seen, I don't have a training partner, but I've seen in gyms where someone will be training and someone will tap the muscle of the person who is doing the work in order to, this is consensual tapping of other people's muscles, not walking around. Watching people's muscles, please. To provide that proprioceptive feedback so that the person doing the exercises becomes more aware of the muscle that they're supposed to be training. And it seems that that's probably an effective practice. Yeah. I'll give you two examples. I'll go to the back with that pulling movement, and then I'll stand the belt really quickly. So a very easy example that you can do right now, listening, and I learned this from Brian McKenzie or mutual friend. So if you take your hands and open them up, like you make an L with both your hands. And I'll take those and put them around your waist just above your hip bones. Now, what I want you to do is press out as hard as you can on your hands with your core. And you can feel a lot of core activation. A most people think core activation is the front of your stomach, right? Your six pack. What you need to do is create a cylinder around your back. So it's the front. It's the side. And it's the back. So if you take your two fingers, point them. Now put them just outside your belly button. Can you move your fingers while just moving your abs muscles? 90% of people can sit do yes. Same exact thing. Now go to that same position just above what's called your ASIS. So your anterior spirally explained right up that front of your hip bone. Right in the front. Can you now move? Great. 50% of people are not going to get any movement there. Really? Take your thumb and go right above your PSIs. My what? PSIs. Posterior spirally explained. Right? Now can you move? Most likely now. Sort of if I do a mini low back extension. Don't just with your core muscature. Barely. Yeah. 90% of people can't. If you can't perform that contraction, you can't stabilize your spine. So only way to get stabilization in your spine is then to go through high Break extension. And now that's a compression strategy you're putting in your spine. It's better than rounding your back like going forward. But over extension is not great either. So you want to be able to flex the muscature in a cylinder fashion. So you have controlling control. So if you go back to our very first things and with your hands open and you put them right here. And if you're like, I can't get activation. If you pay attention to your thumb. Right? Now just move your thumb. And now you see activation back there right? Mm-hmm. Boom. Now if you can imagine turning that on just a little bit. And now notice how I can do this by the way at the same time I'm talking. If you have to go. We don't have control right? So you have to be able to separate breath from brace. So now if I can put my position and Kelly started it as always. 20% give me 20% activation here. And now I can squat. I can hinge. I can jump. I can be locked down to 100% scream to be able to brace my spine. That's going to be ineffective in a way. I want to be here. Well the belt provides that proper receptive feedback where I can put it on 20%. And it just is a reminder. If I don't press against the belt the belt slides and falls down a little bit. Because it's not on super tight. If it's on so dang tight doing the work and I forget. So we just want a little bit of feedback there. Same thing with your upper back. If you're having a difficult time activating those rhomboys of those lats. So I'm going to do a simple thing where they take their finger. Put a right between your shoulder blades. And you just tell them things like, hey, squeeze my finger. Squeeze my finger. I just do your bent row where you're pulled down. You can touch the lat. You can do this visualization stuff. So just imagine like a 3D rendering of that muscle group. And you're watching that muscle group contract. It's very powerful and very effective to do it. So touch. A visual. All this stuff can help. Get people to activate. Outside of simple awareness. Typically, e-centric overload is a very effective way for activation of a difficult to target muscle. So the lowering of the bar or the lowering of the weight. The movement of the weight away from the body is not necessarily was lowering. Because that kind of depends on what I'm doing right. That is true. Yeah. Things like a pull up. Okay. So if I'm going to do a pull up and I have poor lat activation, I can still get the pull up muscle movement executed by contraction of the biceps and things like that. However, to make the movement simpler, I'm going to go all the way to the top. So imagine stepping out of box or something going all the way to that top of that pull up position. And starting from there, I want you to simply lower it under control. And so you're just simply breaking the movement down into smaller pieces that allow you to focus on the execution more. It's going to be great. E-centric are great for strength development. Very good for hypertrophy. And allow you to focus on control. I'm willing to bet a huge percentage of you out there who's like, I've never had a sore lat. You know, I've done a lot of pull-ups and things like that. If you do that e-centric only, you'll probably wake up the next day going, Oh gosh. I feel it there. And that's the sign. Even if you didn't fill it in the workout, but I got a little sore the next day. Keep down that path. And then eventually you'll be able to do a concentric. Maybe take a break. Maybe do an isometric. We just hold that position. And eventually work that into a progression where you can do the concentric e-centric and isometric portions. And get activation. So that that may take you six weeks. May take you six months. But that's generally a pretty good strategy for learning how to activate them also grow. Terrific suggestions. Is it true that e-centric emphasized movements might require a little bit longer recovery or they lead to more soreness than concentric movements? Yeah, they typically can, but they're also higher force output. So very good for strength development. But they're going to lead on average to more soreness. So more potential for interest failure disruption. That is going to be associated with pain. There's not as much people who like to explain muscle soreness as a result of micro trauma and micro tears in the muscle. That can happen, but that's not the norm. Most of the time it is things like disruption of calcium. That's going to lead to excessive swelling, excessive pressure. And that's going to be then translated as extreme pain. So that's probably explaining more muscle soreness than actually micro trauma. Terrific. I was going to get to breathing later, but maybe just for now, if we can do a brief, a little for it into breathing, as it relates to weight training. Yeah. Is there a prescriptive for how to breathe during resistance training? Here I'm thinking with weights. Yeah. And not necessarily body weight only movements, although I suppose it could be that applies 75% of the time to 75% of people. What I was taught and I'm hoping you're going to tell me this was wrong because then there might be more benefits that are waiting me. But is that I should exhale on the effort and inhale on the lesser effort portion of an exercise? Is that true? Is there a better way to breathe? There is a better way to think about it. So number one, if you can breathe and embrace, then this conversation goes away. So if you can maintain intra-muscular, intrapetominal pressure while breathing, then I don't really care when you breathe. Very challenging to do at very heavy weights. If we flag this on two areas of a paradigm, paradigm one over here, you're going to do a set of 30. And you're going to do front squats where a barbell is sitting on your throat. If you don't take a breath, this is going to end one way and one way only. You pass it on. Clearly has to be some breathing strategy. The other end of the spectrum is let's say you're going to do a vertical jump. You don't need any amount of breath there. It's never going to happen. The question is, what about in the middle? So I'm doing some sort of strength training there. Well, number one, make sure you're braced and then you can get away with less need to worry about it. In general, a decent strategy is to maintain a breath hold during the lowering or eccentric or most dangerous part of the movement. And then you can exhale on the concentric portion. So if the bench presses are example, if you held in, braced, lowered in a control, and now started the concentric pushing away for it. And then you wanted to take an expiration during the last half of the concentric portion that's an okay strategy. If you're going to do a single rep, you don't need to worry about it. You can just avoid or omit breathing entirely. You're going to be just fine. If you're doing more than that, especially three to four to five to seven eight, you're going to have to have some breathing strength. A very common one is probably every third breath. I'm going to do like, Excellen of third reset, rebreathe, something like that. If you feel like you need to breathe after every one, that's okay, but it's going to get wasteful. Because you have to take time in between reps of sitting there. If it's a squat, that's different versus a deadlift. If you're resting at the bottom, so there is a little bit of game here. So in general, though, is that 75, 75 kind of relief thrown out. You threw out, breathe in through the lowering and exhale on the out. If you have to less reps, don't worry about more reps, then you need to come up with some sort of breathing strategy. How about breathing in between sets and maybe even after the workout? Yeah. This is something I think a lot of people overlook. And because that it is the case that recovery has to do both with the specific activation and two muscles and the nervous system. But also the attacks on the nervous system can also take place between sets. If you're really geared up between sets and you go to adrenaline, you know, as high in between sets or close to it as you are during your sets, you can imagine that the recovery would take longer. Or at least that you're not spending adrenaline in the most efficient way if there is such a thing. Yeah, fair. You're not going to see any athlete that I work with, just breathe in between. Whether it's in between innings or in between rounds. Every single one of them is going to go back, sit in the stool and they're going to immediately be into a breathing routine. A very intentional one. They're a little bit different for every athlete, depending on the sport. Even PGA golfer. There's going to be a, we just set our ball. We're moving to the next one. We're going to go into a breathing strategy. Everyone of them. It's a huge area of potential benefit and consequence if you're just ignoring it. In general, we want to do any sort of calming breath. You want to restore it depends on if the, depends on where we're combating or combating a little oxygen or high CO2. So that strategy is going to be a little bit different. But in general, that is a huge time opportunity to get better. In fact, people can go back and listen to some of your earlier episodes. You talked about what you have spoken about, I think, on this show. When neuroplasticity works. And if you're losing that opportunity, post-exercise, you're leaving gains on the table if you will. So not only are you going to see everything athletes that I work with mostly have a reason strategy in competition. We're not going to just finish a workout, high five drink water and walk out of the gym. There will be a down regulation strategy that is heavily involved with some sort of light control as well as breath control. The individual prescription on that. There's a ton of variation with what you can do. The easiest thing is do something that comes you down. Most likely that's going to be moved towards as much nails or breathing as you can possibly do. And a really easy rule of thumb is a double exhale length relative to inhale. So if you need to take a like four second inhale, double that time and breathe out for eight seconds. A box breathing is fine. So equal inhale, equal hold, equal exhale, equal hold. So four second inhale for second exhale, hold, etc. A triangle is fine too. There's a lot of ways you can get really complicated like what Brian McKenzie will do in Rob. Those guys have you can get all kinds of systems for inhale, like so control it can be optimized. But some strategy of calm. We're going to almost always put you on your back or close and then we're going to cover light. We can do some like we've done actually a number of musical interventions as well. But you can as just as simple as sit down a locker room if you have to. And just breathe for five minutes. That alone is going to be productive. That's great. If you're breathing in a locker room for five minutes, that's just closing your eyes or you get some funny looks. And if you'll still get funny looks, but you won't see people looking at you. Yeah, exactly. I love this and I started doing this because you and Brian McKenzie informed me about this. And it completely changed the rate of recovery for me. I realized that I was leaving work out both endurance workouts and strength hypertrophy workouts. Feeling great, but looking at my phone getting right into email and meetings, not concentrating on my breathing. And all I did was to introduce a on your recommendation a five minute downregulation. So exhale emphasized breathing a bunch of different varieties physiological size box breathing. Exhale emphasized twice as long as the inhale component for five minutes. And I noticed two things. One I recovered more quickly. Work out to work out. No question about it. Yeah. The numbers told me that. And the other is that I used to have this dip in energy that would occur three or four hours after a hard workout. And I always thought that had to do with the fact that I generally eat in the meal at some point, post workout. Turns out it wasn't the meal at all. It's that adrenaline ramp up during the workouts. I wasn't clamping that at the end. And so I think eventually it's crashed. And then three or four hours later, I'm having a hard time even reading what's on the screen of my computer thinking maybe it's the screen. Maybe it was what eight for lunch turns out the downregulations allowed me to work through the afternoon with no issues whatsoever. Yeah. It's really been quite powerful and so I'm grateful to you for that. And I think this is something that I think 98% of people are not doing. And it's only five minutes. You have to do five. Give me three. If you really have to push it, give me three. And you can even do this. You can save time. You can do this in the shower if you have to. So you're you're done, you're finished, drink a water, whatever has to be and you're getting a shower, you're getting ready. Just give me three minutes in shower. It's not ideal, but as little as that it can pay huge dividends. You need some sort of internal signal that we're safe. Like throttle down here. We're going to move on. That has to happen. I could go on around here, but I think we're making the same point kind of over again. It's big deal on to it. Yeah, and you're saving energy. I mean, the energy here is neural energy. I think fighters do this. Good fighters learn to do this between rounds. Yeah. Sprinters learn to do this between events. I think human should learn how to do this between any, you know, sort of interval type activity, including work social engagement. Yeah. I mean, it's so such a powerful tool to do this for one minute after every important. Whether it's an individual high volatile interaction or if it's you just did a nice 45 minutes sprint to work and you're deep into it or whatever fine. Just give me one minute. Set your alarm just one minute and that also will pay dividends. I love it. And as I said, it's made to exercise different positive difference on my training, but also activities outside. My training, which is for me. I'm not a professional athlete. I train for health because I enjoy it, but when a really hard workout starts interfere with the ability to do the other things in life, that's not a good situation. So this is really terrific. There's a lot more in each of those categories of strength and hypertrophy, but you've given us a tremendous amount of valuable information there. Maybe now I would be a good time to shift to endurance. And of the four types of endurance, and maybe you could remind us what those are. What do you think are the two that most people are seeking or pursuing in terms of health and aesthetics? Right. I'm a realize that we probably have athletes out there as well, but when I think health and aesthetics, I think the ability to do sustained endurance 30 plus minutes of someone going activity. How does one maximize that work? What are the modifiable variables? And then maybe you could tell us what the the other major category is that people ought to have in their kit. Okay. So starting off with exercise choice. One thing as soon as we cross into the endurance world, and this is true for all four of those categories, exercise choice needs to be very concerned with eccentric landing. You don't need to avoid it, but you need to recognize it. Relative or compared against those other strength and speed ones. The volume is low on those ones. So if you have some eccentric absorption, it's okay. But as we sort of talked about five minutes ago, more eccentric means greater chance of muscle damage, so if you take something and magnify it across 30 minutes, or even five minutes, but of maximum exertion, you have a recipe for blowing up. You can imagine I haven't run and forever, and I've just listened to this human lab podcast, and I'm okay. I'm going to get into my zone to training, whatever it is. And I start jogging. I'm going to do, I remember when I used to be able to do 25 and you just do a 25 minute jog. The amount of eccentric landing that just occurred on every single step, because you're never with running, even slow running, you never have 2 feet on the ground at the same time. So it is a one foot land, one foot land, your entire body mass plus gravity, under one leg at a time, repeated now hundreds of times. That eccentric landing is going to cost tremendous soreness. Your quads are going to go, you're probably going to get shin splints, which is what this is, those are entirely caused by eccentric landing, and when the tissue is not ready to tolerate that, if you're not landing correctly, this is when knee pain happens, back pain, shoulder neck pain, because of movement compensation. So anytime we start pressing to fatigue, let's be very concerned with there. So my initial recommendation is start with activities exercise choice-wise, that are mostly concentric based. So think about a cycle. So when you're riding on a bike, you're pushing the pedal, but you're never landing and absorbing it. So you could go out and do a 45 minute bike ride, and you're not going to get that sore because there's not a lot of eccentric load. Swimming, similar thing here, right? There's some eccentric when you're at can, it's the water, but fairly minimal. It's mostly a push, push, push, push, no load. Rowing, similar thing, mostly concentric, pushing a sled is fantastic going uphill, running or even walking hard uphill. All good because they're very minimal landing relative to like running downhill, which would be a very, very bad idea to start. So when you, if you're first jumping into these things, progress your volume for endurance, very slowly, if it involves eccentric landing. A really bad strategy, we'd be to jump in and do say circuit training class and involves a bunch of box jumps. Right? This is not a good way to do your first floor, right, into conditioning. You're going to get incredibly sore because you're jumping in the landing. You're now looking at three to 10 x spotty weight in terms of absorption with a single landing, even if you're just jumping. So be careful of that, and any of those endurance areas of exercise choice. So what to pick? Pick the one that you are most technically proficient in, because you're going to do it a lot. It's going to be a lot of repetitions. Whatever one you feel the most joy in, if that's rowing, great. If that's pushing a sled, it doesn't really matter. You can do this actually with weights. This is our preferred way by the way with our athletes. So we might do a 30 minute circuit, where we do a five minute farmers carry. With a pretty light weight, so you're just going to carry some weights in your hand and you're just going to walk up on the street for five minutes. You're going to set that down and then you're going to do say a three minute plank, and then you're going to pick that up and you're going to do body weight squats. Like slowly and just tempoed. And you're going to do a handful of different exercises so the athletes don't get super bored. Or a very simple one if a 30 minute workout, 10 minutes on a treadmill, 10 minutes on a bike, 10 minutes on a row. But for those of you who are like, oh my god, I can't do the 30 straight minutes running cool, break it up. And the three or four different exercises that are all fairly safe. So that's how I would do that long duration piece for exercise choice. And then in terms of heart rate during that period, I mean, how much tension should we pay to this? I, they're kind of very broad prescriptive. I've thrown out on this podcast a few times based on my read of the literature is for most people that are oriented toward health, including people that are working on size and strength gains, that part of your feet and strength. Of course, that getting 150 to 180 minutes of so-called zone to cardio, you know, can just have a, just barely have a conversation. But if one were to push any harder, you wouldn't be able to do that kind of thing. It's just a, as a, a generic recommendation that almost everybody should follow it in order to just keep their cardiovascular system healthy. But I know there's a lot of nuance there. And some people would like to be able to run continuously for an hour at speed, right? Obviously not sprinting, but what are some of the finer finer points on long distance endurance? So how often should one do it? Okay. Frequency could do it a daily. Even when strength doing strength in hyper-term. No question. Well, that I think is an important point for people to hear because a lot of people think that they are going to greatly diminish their strength in hypertrophy. You know, gains as it's often called by doing in zone to cardio. Zone to you have almost no ability to block your hypertrophy. Zone to truly, if it's really, within that category, if you're talking about conversational pace, there is very, in fact, there's strong reason to think that is not going to influence hypertrophy for the overwhelming majority of people. It might even help it by increasing blood flow to the various levels. Does it matter? Let's say someone's doing primarily strength in hypertrophy. They're primary goals are strength in hypertrophy. And then they're going to do, they're going to hit that 150 to 180 minutes zone to cardio per week. Assuming they're breaking that up into three or four sessions, does it matter if they do it in the same workout before or after? Does that matter? I tend to do just by way of example for people. Certainly, I'm just one example. I tend to do resistance training one day, then I'll do zone to cardio in the next eye jog. Because that's the thing I prefer. Then I'll do strength upper to retrain on the next day and then jog for my zone to cardio. And then I take one full day off a week. I've never actually done the zone to cardio on the same day, but we're right to do it on the same day. Would it matter if I did it before or after my strength upper to be training? Not really. You're going to be just fine. Interference effects. The interference effect is what this is called. So this is all the way back to 1980 about Hickman stuff, right? And he was actually working in a lab with John Alazzi, who's one of the fathers of exercise biochemistry. And the story goes that Hickman came in and he was the strength training guy. And Alazzi, almost all those initial exercise physiologists, were conditioning folks, right? So it's almost always swimmers and runners. And that's why a bulk of the exercise physiology historically is shaped in that direction. And so those sciences were interested in. So Hickman was there in the lab and then the. How much of this is myth or not? Or they knows, but so the story goes that there's this sort of chipping back and forth and you know how. From a PI to postdoc and kind of that razzing works a little bit. And eventually he's like you got to start running with us and he's like you got to start lifting with me and kind of goes back and forth. Well, you know who wins that equation. It's not the postdoc, right? So it's the PI gets in and says, it's okay. And so we start running with Alazzi and eventually starts realize I'm getting weak. I'm losing strength and I got just can't. I think it was his bench press specifically was going down or maybe he's squat. I can't remember. Who knows if it's even real, but point is. So he's going along. So eventually like starts to create a little bit of animosity. And it's like actually I don't think it's good for me and then blah blah blah. And so they did what any good scientists are doing said, well, let's find out, right? And so that he run a really famous experiment where he took a group three groups. And then the group did a endurance piece, right? The steady state cardio, one group did a strength training piece. And then the third group did both of those workouts combined. Not like a reduction. So both both volumes stacked on top of each other. And the results are unfairly predictable in terms of the endurance group. Only had the greatest increases in VO2 max and endurance markers. The strength training group had the greatest increases in muscle hypertrophy. But where the interesting part was where this whole field started was the combined group. The strength training is what is generally called. So you're doing concurrent things. And typically that means hypertrophy and strength stacked on top of some steady state endurance. In the same work. Same work out to our block or same like week. It doesn't really make it can be kind of all these. Well, the concurrent group saw the same improvements in VO2 max as the endurance group. And he's like, well, okay. So the strength training did not compromise endurance adaptations. However, they saw much lower increases in strength than I particularly. And so it was the conclusion was the addition of endurance work. Compromised muscle growth and strength development. However, the addition of strength training to your endurance work will not compromise your endurance gains. Now that second piece has been shown countless more times. So if you're going to endurance athlete adding strength training is almost always going to be massively beneficial. So if you're going to be a little chance of the detriment or an is why every endurance athlete is going to have some sort of strength and power component they're training. The controversy though came in the interference effects. So how much endurance training really blocks muscle development. And for years myself included was we preached hard. You know, don't don't do these two things at the same time. My friend, my colleague Kevin Mirac has a really nice review article. Jimmy Bagley, those two guys put this thing out. You can go read that. All these things. They've got some nice figures in there. But the general answer here is. Interference effect is sort of real, but it's probably greatly overblown. It matters. So are you talking about a 20 minute jog at conversation pace? That's probably doing very little. With the assumption that are you doing an eccentric basic exercise like running? Well, then you're going to have more of interference effect than cycling. That makes a ton of sense if you think about it, right? What's your total energy intake? If you're eating sufficient calories, you can still be in an animal x-state. If the addition of extra energy expenditure, it's all over the is Mark, the cardio, put you in a negative energy state. It's going to become very difficult to go through anabolism. So those things matter. If you're talking about doing like running a few laps around the track as a warm up, like that's not interference effect. What we're really talking about is a big volume performed consistently. Now, after Hickman came out with this paper in 1980, people followed it up in the 90s and 2000s with mechanism. And we started to look and see, we started to see, hey, there's this cell signaling pathway that goes down to, called, M-tor. And that's what leads to muscle growth. And then on the other side of that equation, there's a thing called, MPK, which is more associated with mitochondria biogenesis and endurance. And there's this little molecule in between at the time, most people would point to TSC2. Well, it turns out, MPK activation is fine. If you activate M-tor, there's no bearing on MPK, but if you activate the MPK, it's going to activate TSC2, which inhibited M-tor. And so it was like, we had practical outcome. I eat Hickman, you're going to get weaker. Now we had mechanism. So that story became very, very strong at this interference effect. And this is how science should work, right? When you see mechanism matchup of practical human outcome, it's a strong thing. Yeah. He was still wrong though. It just took more science, right? And this is why we always have to give science a bit of time. And you have to be willing to follow, right? And again, even me in the field who has a practitioner background in science, I felt very strongly. This is a big problem. It just didn't try to be the case. And enough studies came out where I'm like, okay, it's probably not that big a deal. Unless the movement is heavily eccentric based, the volume is very high. You're trying to maximize muscle growth and energy is not controlled. If that's not all the case interference effect is probably not something most people should worry about. When you're especially when you compare that against the well-roundedness that you need for total physiology of health, probably not a big deal. Very reassuring for me to hear because I do enjoy lifting weights and I really enjoy running. And I love running outside. I believe I used to experience the interference effect when I used to do a very long run on Sundays. I would just go out for two hours or something like that. I don't know that I ate enough or who knows. I always feel like I eat enough or more. I love to eat. But that long Sunday run always made it hard for me to make progressive. Yeah. Like, gains in strength and hypertrophy in the gym. Whereas when I cut that to 30 minutes, three or four times a week, I don't see any interference effect at all. Probably very real. And I haven't trained specifically for endurance in a very long time. So I haven't experienced the non interference effect. Which as you said before, most, if not all endurance athletes probably are, at least, should be doing some sort of strength work. Just to keep the undercarriage strong as I think. Yeah, there's a bunch of experiences. Yeah, but yeah. So what are some protocols that people could explore for continuous endurance training? I'm going to have thrown out this 150 to 180 minute zone two cardio. But that's really the kind of kindergarten of endurance. Yeah. And there I'm probably being generous. It's probably the nursery school of endurance that everyone should do. What sorts of other protocols? I realize that can be very goal-directed. But is it unreasonable, for instance, for somebody to do four hours of continuous endurance training with in-depth training? With intervals in there as well to get it kind of all around heart health and the ability to go long distances? Yeah, I'll answer this too. It's a very first one. The tackle, the long duration endurance is however for you. You asked really about heart rate zones. To me, that's almost totally irrelevant. It doesn't matter, right? If you're moving, you're moving. That's the functional piece here. If you want to push it and go at a non-conversational pace, that has tremendous health benefits. If you want to do it a little bit slower, fine. If you're at the pace where you can have a conversation to me, I don't even count that as exercise. That's not a pejorative, by the way. That is just general physical movement. It is extraordinarily clear. You need a lot more of that than we get. You can do this in a couple of efficient ways, just taking your phone calls moving. If you've got a 30-minute call every day, or most days the week, and you can do that while moving, you've checked not that whole box, but a pretty good chunk of it. That could even be done inside. A hundred percent. A big pace. A big pace. Yeah, you mean to, like you probably saw me, like I'm going to walk up and down all over the place. Most of the time when I'm in my office working, I'm shadow boxing, I come to an air squads, not even intentionally. I'm just like, do you have one of those treadmills under the dust? I don't, but like every lab I ever came through somebody did. We did an episode on Workspace Optimization, and the date on those treadmills, pretty interesting. They definitely increase alertness, which for obvious reasons, even a little bit, of movement is going to generate a little bit of adrenaline. So pacing around, moving, taking calls moving, getting walks when you can, and then in terms of building endurance, let's say somebody wants to, quote unquote, get into better shape. They already may or may not already have some size and strength that they're happy with, and they just want to get in, they want to improve their health. So what can it do? So what can it do? So what can it do? So what can it do? So what can it do? It's a different protocol. Yeah, okay. So I think the way that I can outline a weekly schedule, just as a conceptual model here, that long duration stuff is not even counting, as I mentioned, right? It's just like, this is what you need to do as a human moving forward. We haven't improved. If you're extremely unfit, you may see some changes in cardiovascular health. For the most part, this is just knocking out the general physical practice, you need to be higher functioning. So whatever that time domain is, I don't really care. It's not a huge concern of mine. What I think you need to hit are these nodes. You need to do something once a week that gets you to a maximum heart rate. Now I don't have to literally mean max, but close. This means really sucking for a really, like as high as you can possibly get. You can wear a heart rate monitor if you want. But maximum heart rate that the rough equation we say is 220 minus your age. So if you're 40 years old, your maximum heart rate is probably about 180 beats per minute. Now I can tell you flat out right now. My max heart rate is close to 210, which means I'm 10 years old. So take that number with a grain of salt. I have had a bunch of professional athletes who are in their 20s and their max heart rate 175. And they are way better shaped than I am. So maximum heart rate is not a good proxy for physical fitness. It's a rough number. An easy way to do it is if you have a heart rate monitor or anything like that. Do the hardest workout you can possibly do. See what the highest number you get as soon as that's close. That's if you want to just start at 220 minus your age, that's fine too. Do something though where you're like, yep, this is death. This is really, really challenging. However long that takes you. That can be a 30 second go on an erudine or aerosolte bike. That could be a do one of those things where you kind of like sprint. Run as hard as you can during the straightaway on a track and then walk the corners. Kind of a little classic back when a new and I were kids interval training. I don't know if you don't do that anymore. I guess I don't know. I really want to talk about it. In P class we had to change and if you didn't bring running shoes you had to do it barefoot. Oh, I love it. I love your teacher. Yeah, it wasn't a pretty we are football basketball baseball teams weren't that good. But anything like running cross country just because of where I grew up. Yeah. Roodle brutal coaches so that yeah, they'd make the all kids do these runs. Yep. So it can be in the the 30 probably seconds at a minimum. It's hard to get you to a true heart rate max and shorter than 30 seconds. You can get the total suck in under 20 seconds, but getting to a true heart rate max is probably going to take more than 30 seconds. So it doesn't really matter what you want to do. It can be again a sprint uphill. It could be what you're talking that could be burpees to death. You know, like whatever you want to do. Those have an eccentric component. Yeah, they do. Yeah. No question about it. But if you did it to actual death by the way. If you just did, I'm going to do as many burpees as I can for 90 seconds. It probably won't take you much longer than that to get the close to an exact or workout. Could be. So once a week get to max heart rate touch it. I love it touch it. It's not the best, but it'll it'll work on it. And what are the specific benefits of that provides? Okay. So earlier in our in our chat, we're we outlined the real specificity specific out of post adaptation to impose demand. If you're never getting to that high of a pace, you're never it would be like trying to get stronger, but only going to 60%. So every cardiovascular adaptation that occurs with cardiovascular training is simply going to get to the top end by doing this. So if you just start at the heart itself. Stroke volume increase. So this is not a blood that's kicked out per contraction. Cardiac output resting heart rate. If you go to the end of the field, you'll function. You're talking about nitric oxide release. The material health in general. Capillary mitochondria all the way down like you just walk through the whole system. Pulmonary exchange to the lungs all of those are going to benefit by being challenged to their maximum. You also teach you where your vomit reflex is. Yeah, right. Let's hope no. Stress is what causes adaptation right. So if you push your okay, here's the difference. If you did 25 minutes of steady state. You're not challenging the same thing as what we just talked about. The way that I explain this is if you understand the point, the point of physiological failure. Then you understand the place of adaptation. That's it. So if you and I both go run on a we did a both did a VL2 max test. So classic VL2 max test is going to take eight to 12 minutes. And it's going to look something like this. We're going to get in a treadmill and we're going to run. And every minute, I'm going to just slightly increase that treadmill. Either the speed of the grade, most of the time it's a speed. Right, so we get to a high grade say 10% grade or something. And then we go five hours, five point two, five point four. And we just go until you can't go any longer. Now let's say you and I did that and we had the same exact time frame. And so we both went eight minutes. The time that you last is not the thing that we care about, right? It's that it's the volume of oxygen that you breathe out is what determines it. So let's say we're at the same time domain and we had the same view of two max. Say they are both 50 milliliters per kilogram per minute, which is like a. Okay number, but that's nothing to be extremely proud about. Just because we have the same number does not mean we have the same point of physical failure. And this matters because it's going to answer the what do I do about it then? Question, right? So if you got off and I started asking you a series of questions and you're like, And I basically said, why do you quit? Why did you jump off the treadmill? Why do you stop? And you were like, my chest, like I couldn't catch my breath. I thought my heart was going to explode. Okay, great. If you ask me and I said, my legs were on fire. I was breathing hard, but I couldn't take another step. This is a very rough indicator of different places of physical. This is a disruption. Now what I've seen a lot with my professional athletes, especially like fighters. They are 10, they're going to generally fail in their legs because they don't often do a lot of strength training in their legs. They don't do a lot of leg work. They're fighting on their back literally a lot. Or on top or on their knees. So they're their legs 10 to give out before there. Someone who fails in the cardiovascular system, like say you did a lot of leg training. Typically I can endurance out. Who's that's not going to be their issue. It's just going to be they're going to reach a heart rate and ventilation threshold that's that can no longer handle. If I put you on the exact same train protocols, it's not going to be as effective because you're going to always fail at your legs and they're going to always fail at their cardiovascular system. I need to flip that. You need to put you in a position where you can reach a true heart rate or ventilation challenge while your legs are still hanging in there or the opposite. So the training protocol is based on that point of failure. The adaptation is in the same thing. So if you are failing because of your legs, then you might see a greater increase in capitalization in your legs. Relative to somebody else who's failing in their cardiovascular system, they may see a greater change in their heart rate. They see a greater change in something on that side of the equation. So that matters how you're failing at all times. What I love about this is that it sounds like it's like a thermometer for where one is weak and needs work, but also provides a stimulus to improve the very thing that you need. That's the trick. So to just get real brass tax about it, it would be once a week. Okay. 90 seconds near maximum heart rate. Could I do more? Could I, you know, could I do five or six of those 90 second bouts? No question. You can do as long as you touch that max heart rate, I'm good, right? I deal world probably four to eight in that single session. Ideal. Okay. If that takes you 20 seconds or 90 seconds, it's fine. If you want to do 30 on 30 off, you want to do 20 on 40 off, 40 on 20 off. Those numbers don't matter. And is there an interference effective of this on the other sorts of training that we've talked about? It actually tends to be complimentary. There is the evidence available suggests that this high interval stuff is more likely to be complimentary to I per tree training. Probably because of lactate. And some other cool things, which are very beneficial molecules that people don't understand. They think it's bad. It's actually a hugely beneficial thing. It can be interference. It can provide interference. If calories are not accounted for for us, not accounted for and other things. But in general, it's probably okay. I wouldn't add it to your equation if you don't need it for maximizing hypertrophy. But for the person who wants to just get well-rounded physiology, yeah, it wouldn't hesitate to do these even in the same session or different sessions. Terrific. So if that's done once a week and the 150 to 180 minutes or so of zone two cardio is done, you know, in the rest of the week, person's doing their strength and hypertrophy training, we would hope. What other sorts of endurance practices could one incorporate? You mentioned muscular endurance. Yeah. Like a wall sit or the ability to do a plank. Is that something that is useful for anything? Yes. Doing planks and wall sit. No, no. It's extraordinarily useful. I'll hold on muscular endurance. I want to finish one more thing on this side. So if we're building this week of endurance. Once a week hit that number, if you can do repeated bounce, we talked four to eight. That's fantastic. If you can't muscle the, if you can't manage the mental energy every week, do it every other week. It's still very good, right? Because I get it. Like I'm a working person too. Sometimes you're just like, I cannot, like those workouts feel incredible afterwards, but man they are daunting. If you love this stuff, you could do it four times a week. If you hate it though, it's not realistic to think you're going to be able to knock this out. You're going to end up doing 70, 80 percent, which is not going to get you the benefits. So just don't do it. You really have to hit that. You've got to get up there. Close. I have someone chase, I always say, you know, the, when doing this kind of work in my mind, I'm thinking that I'm basically being chased by somebody with a syringe full of poison. Yeah. And while there are other ways out of the situation and for the benefit of what we're talking about the one I'm referring to is just run. Yeah. Yeah. My motivation is typically, if you just get this done, we're done on a couple of minutes. Just get it done. Don't go here for not going to do it. We'll show up. Check in and it's over really quickly breathing down regulation after 100 percent. You have to. Right. It's easy. Huge key. So if you absolutely can't do it, do it every week. That's twice a month. Give me twice a month. Can we down on the road? Can we down at 20 minutes? Like do it. Really good thorough warm up. Don't just jump into those by the way right away. It's not going to be as beneficial. Really nice, good sweat, broke. A really good warm up and then give me four minutes of hard work and we're done. Right. Get out of there. If you want to use like a bath or hot thermal stress to kind of like aid in that warm-up process, fine, getting the sauna, getting the hot bath gear really hot, get up there, warm up, knock it out. Whole thing is 20 minutes, plus five minutes breathing. I'm going to start doing this. It's so, but you got a bike right there. Yeah. I've got all sort of every room in this studio to that's a different piece of equipment. It seems. So I want that one's a week, realistically, every week if I have to. I want that physical activity piece, call it whatever you want, long duration thing. Ideally, you'll do as much of that through your nose only. You're not going to be able to do the interval stuff. It knows only, don't even try. But if you can go that whole 30 minute time or 20 or 40 minutes, whatever it's going to be, that's actually a good way to regulate intensity. So it goes hard as you can while still being able to breathe through your nose only. If you have to open up your mouth a little bit, fine, but try to stay there. What you'll see is very quickly. You'll be able to increase your workout put while just breathing through your nose, which has a bunch of other, beyond the benefits. The other piece I want is this middle ground, which is can you sustain hard work for eight to 12, maybe as little as four minutes. I'll give you four to 12 minutes. It doesn't have to be quite as high as the first one. You don't have to get to heart and max, but can you get somewhere in the 80% range? And can you hold that for four minutes? Maybe give me two minutes, two minutes arrest and do that twice. Something like that. Ideal situation is what a runner would do is like what we'll call mile repeats. Because they're running four or five minute miles. Whatever time it takes them to finish, they're going to rest that. So it's a one to one worked arrest ratio. So a five minute mile, rest five minutes and go again. That's probably pretty unrealistic for a lot of folks. Well, the five minute part is unrealistic for most folks for me. It would be eight minutes, eight minutes. Fine. Probably something like that. Well, in your particular case, just do the 800 meter. So do 80 meters. Do something that takes two to six minutes work. It is a lower intensity than the max stuff, but as a much higher workload, that is probably going to give you, you might even argue, the most cardiovascular benefit because it is sustained workout put. And that's very critical. The downside of kind of like that conversational pace. It's physical activity, it's movement, it's blood flow with them factored range. It's not very cardiovascular challenging. You're just not going to get an optimal health or just walking actively. So two to six minutes of hard work of hard work with then an equivalent amount of rest in between and then repeat how many times. Once if you have to, if you need to be one rep, if it needs to be a six minute thing and then down regularly breathe twice, if you can do that six times eight times, like whatever you can really do, and you can just take that as long as the training session as you want or short. Exercise choice can be whatever you want. So again, you can do sled push, or it could be a kettlebell circuit, or any combination of things where you're just working and you're not giving yourself a break. You have got to be able to hold on at a very high waist product production level, as well as a high demand for energy. And then bring it down. And breathing during this two to six minutes of hard output is mainly through the nose or combination nose and mouth or is that getting too technical. Well, it's probably like I like it, but you tell me if it's too technical, you're going to try to maintain nasal only as much as you can, but you're going to lose it at some point. You can go through their Brian and Rob's gear system and learn more, and then you can kind of see what gear to be in. If you have to go nose and mouth out or something like that, but I don't really care too much honestly, not range. I'm getting most of my nasal only stuff at night and training and everything. So if you have to open up the throttle there to get the work done, that's okay. Oh, then no one will actually go to your answer your question, which is Musker endurance. Let's go back to that piece. Musker endurance is incredibly important for general maintenance of joint health. In other words, you have got form follows function, right? It's a very classic sciencey physiology saying meaning you've got a couple of different, there's a bunch, but to make it easy, two different types of muscle fibers. Fast twitch and slow twitch fast twitch fibers tend to be, but they're not always bigger. They contract with the higher velocity, that's why they are called fast twitch, but they tend to be more glycolic and thus fatigable. Slow twitch are tend to be smaller, they're more packed with mitochondria, they're generally better at burning fat as fuel but contract lower velocity. Well, we have these two types so that we can regulate function more. You have some muscle groups that we're going to, oh, sorry, let me go back up a quick second. Each individual muscle in a human body has a combination of some amount of fast and some amount of slow. That percentage of fast versus slow differs from muscle to muscle. So, it also differs from person to person. Easy example is your calf muscle. There's three, but there's two primary muscles in your calf. Once called the soleus, once the gastroach. The gastroach is the one or if you take your toe and point it towards your face and then flex, that's the one that pops out on the medial side, the inside. The soleus will call it anti-gravity muscle, and it is generally about 80% to even 90% slow twitch. And that's because it's supposed to be contracted lightly all time. This will be on permanently. It's meant to keep, we call it anti-gravity because it's meant to keep you erect up and moving. You're spinal erectors supposed to do this various muscles for postural or are generally slow twitch muscles. So, it's supposed to be on all times not produced fast, not produced force, but don't get tired. The gastroach is the opposite. It's not activated very often, but when it's activated, it's meant for extreme propulsion. So this gives us the ability to reach up and scratch our eyeball and also punch somebody. All right, we have to be able to regulate force output, which is going back to hennamen, right? Controlling what we use when we don't use while also not wasting energy, which is the downside of activating a big threshold motor neuron, is it requires a ton of energy. So, more efficient mode of energy, but the total amount is really, really high. So, muskly and turns is going to help those slow twitch muscle fibers and the muscle fibers, and slow twitch predominant muscles, maintain their working job. So, if you lose your muskly and turns ability in your spinal erectors or your calf, you're going to start slumping into bad positions. You're going to be putting joints in a movement pattern that they're not going to be the most happy with. So, it's more than about being able to just maintain a two minute loss squat. It's about maintaining joint integrity, and allowing that muskly to not fatigue when you ask it to do heavy and fast. So, what I mean by that is, you've got a whole combination of muscles in your shoulder, and we will generally call these like the rotator cuff muscles. Well, let's imagine those slow twitch, postural muscles get fatigued, and they start to lose contract and attention. And then you go to do something heavy or fast or an emergency situation. Those are already pre-futigued. You're going to rely more upon the faster to muscle fibers, which are their less for postural integrity. You're likely to get out of position, and this is a whole recipe of like, why is my shoulder dishearding? Got my back. That's very often a case of the slow twitch fibers, the slow twitch muscle groups, losing muscular endurance. So, you need to build that back up so that they can control and hold the joint in the position, so the faster it's virus, because they can contract with force. I'm hoping that what I'm going to say next meets what you said accurately. My experience is that getting injured, lifting weights, or even doing housework or yard work, almost always happens when I'm not paying attention fatigued, that's kind of obvious. But also getting in position to initiate a movement, setting down a weight or lifting weights off the rack or picking up dumbbells. Almost always when I seem to activate this lower back thing that happens every six or eight months. And what you're saying, if I understand correctly, is that this muscular endurance from wall sits or planks or things of that sort, maybe you could give us a few other examples of these, can help us because they actually prepare the system to do what we normally think of as the more intense work. So, it's really that it sounds like it's really the architecture of the body, includes nerves and muscles and everything else, of course, that lets the limbs and other kind of action end of the body do its best work. Yeah, literally. It's a solid power and force. We actually landed on one of my final laws of strength conditioning, which is similar to when I said earlier, right? So, I said, exercise is not to determine adaptations, application determines adaptation. This will sound similar, but it's quite different. There are no good or bad exercises. There's only good or bad application. Here's a great example of that. Right? So, you do not get hurt deadlifting because deadlifts are dangerous. You only get hurt deadlifting because you either got in bad position. You got in bad position because you either started in bad position, which is one of the things you just said, or you ended up in bad position. You did too much volume. You did too much intensity or you did too much complexity. Those last three things all hurt you because they result in the first one, which is out of position. Or another way to think about this is if it's not like a visible change in position is stress, got put into a part of the system that should not absorb that much stress. So, you did too much of it. You did it too heavy. You got fatigue. You got too heavy so you broke position. You made that exercise too complex. You put too many parts in it. You put too many joints in it. And you got it in position. You did that too many times over time. Now we've led to either an acute injury. Bam. Backpops and you fall on a floor. Or just like, man, this thing is hurting over time. All these are the same thing. So, you cannot ever blame the exercise for causing the problem. It's always either the user or the coach. You're going to wait too much here and I can't handle that position. Or you yourself went into it too much. So, if you're getting these little tweaks and problems going on, you've made an error in one of those things. So, simply back off. Reduce the complexity. Right? Give yourself more stability. Less moving parts. Do less volume. Do less intensity. In fact, if you look at the people from the physical therapy world in terms of the pain literature, it's very clear that just stopping a movement is very rarely going to work. But you want to be back off all the way down to just below that threshold of that's what aggravates it. And you want to train right there. That's going to allow you to do two things. Number one, tissue tolerance. And then number two, decentitization. A lot of pain stuff, and you can probably speak a lot about this, is especially things like low back pain. Is there's not necessarily often much damage there. It's a lot of hypercentitization of just pain signal, pain signal. Oh, meaning the movement entirely does not get that signal to go away. You need to train just below that signal and desensitize it. So you want to make sure that the Musker endurance allows you, you're just putting volume right below where you start to get a tweak. And it is beautifully effective for that. I've experienced this right side lower back pain for years. Sometimes shooting down the hip. The two things that really helped. We're doing anterior tip work. So you have hats off to Knees over to Skye and Patrick who has, you know, created a lot of pain. Has, you know, created a lot of popularity around. Yeah. Tip work. But it turns out joints full range emotion. You're in a better spot. Yeah. The, something about stabilizing the stuff from the knee down, help my back. And then also some some neck work in friends of mine are always teasing me. That my gym is filled with the, the Musker's are equipment. You know, it doesn't look like any other gym. A lot of it is just designed to keep me healthy and still training. But I love this idea of getting right at the below the threshold of pain activation and not simply going into, to complete. Um, non action or just taking really risk because that actually can be detrimental. I'd love to talk about a few items that support training of all kinds and where there's a lot of confusion and indeed. Misconception and mystery and just get your take on these and I just want to acknowledge it the outset that for some of these, There's a lot of science for some of them. There's less science, but there certainly is a lot of experience in, in your camp. And those categories are cold, heat and hydration. Because obviously whether or not you're a runner, whether or not you're strength training, if you're a human being, you need to hydrate. But in terms of work output and physical workout put, maybe you can cognitive workout, but maybe it's tackle hydration first. There is what what I call what I think is now come to be known as the galvan equation, which you really do deserve credit for because I think that people realize that there are range of solutions out there, but there is a really a desperate need for straightforward solutions that work for 75% of people, 75% of the time. So hydration is key. Maybe you could underscore just how, how key it is for us. And then what is the galvan equation as I call it and I think others are now referring to it. Yeah. Okay. Benefits of hydration slash consequences of mishydration. So whether it's dehydration or overload, you, physiology has armatic curves. Right? Now typically we think about this in terms of toxicology. So what this means is at some point, giving you a dose of something up to testosterone to a very easy example. If you're clinically, deficient or low into testosterone and I give you a little bit, you know, bring you back to normal range. You generally see an improvement in health and functionality taking you though from normal to super high, doesn't always necessarily provide additional benefit. In fact, if you continue to go, it's going to provide detriment. So everything has this curve. And then some things are armatic stressors, which means like a small short, fast insult is actually beneficial because then you come back, bigger or faster, stronger. That's how an adaptation works. Basic or meces. Okay. Hydrations the same way. So at the end of the curve here, if you are under hydrated. Well, I'll know you could die, right? You can have to have things in fact. Water is the only thing that is ubiquitous across biologies in terms of every living thing has to have it. There's no other vitamin, mineral nutrient that is required among all living things with the exception of water. So that should give you a pretty good indication of it's important to it, right? Like you got to have this thing. Down here at the bottom, if you're dehydrated and I give you more, it's beneficial effects. However, if you are up the top already and I continue to give you more water past that, now we run into actually problems. So we can give what's called hype on a tree mea, which is more common than people realize. The tree mea being actually not referring to the water, but the sodium concentration being too low. And you've probably talked about that a length of why that's an issue. If sodium potassium balances inside outside of cell come off, you hard stops. Right, muscle contraction ends and all these things. So you don't want to be over or under hydrated. So understanding this rough equation, I sort of loosely calculated one day is helpful for that. I think the most context is talking about how much water to drink throughout the day, and then how much water to drink during exercise. So the very easy answer is half your body weight, Nouns' per day, is a very loose guideline for total amount of fluid consumption. So if you weigh 200 pounds and for 100 ounces of water, it's like a very easy number. If you hit that, you're probably out say 90% of you are good 90% of the time along. If you then go to exercise, you need to then account for that fluid loss with exercise. And in general, you want to consume 125% to 150% of the amount of weight you lost in fluid. In other words, if you worked out and you were 200 pounds naked and you ended your workout and then you dried off and you weighed yourself again and now you're 198 pounds. You lost 2 pounds of water, that's 32 ounces. You want to drink back about 125% of that. So instead of drinking 32 ounces, I want you to drink 42, 45, like something like this. Because one of the reasons why is unless you're drinking something that is isotonic, meaning the same exact concentration in your blood, that you're in your fluid, you're just going to go closer to that high point of training. You're going to get a bunch of better, a lot of more of your responses. And you're going to actually think you have too much fluid and you're going to donate it out. What's up? I'm not weighing myself before and after workouts. And is there a short hand version of this that after training for an hour, I should drink at least, at some revounces? Yeah, assuming it's at kind of taller, you know, I'm not sweating super heavily. Yeah. In that particular case, you could probably go something like, if everyone in the world did, I don't know, 12 to 20 ounces, that's probably pretty decent. And they're probably doing that. Yeah. And what about electrolytes in consuming salt potassium and magnesium? But that thing only works though, if you're coming in at optimization. And this is the problem. This is why you have to you have to flag this starting with a good total daily amount of water. Because if you're coming in and you're like, oh, I drank two or three glass of water a day. Then you might need to drink 50 or 60 ounces post workout because you're way behind. So that like 12 ounces or so works if you're already generally very well hydrated. People are drinking, you know, four to six glasses of water a day, but they're also drinking a lot of caffeine in any form. Then they're going to be excretion more water in most cases, right? Well, because caffeine's a diuretic. Okay, it kind of is, but it kind of isn't either. It's not the diuretic that we used to think about it as it is still fluid consumption. So it's only a diuretic if it causes you to excrete more fluid than it actually was being in tech. So if caffeine intake is in a normal range, I don't have to worry about the diuretic effects. If someone is drinking 12 cups of coffee a day or they're taking caffeine pills or something. Now the excretion is going to outkick the coverage. So now we're now problems, right? Because there's no fluid consumption with the caffeine pill. So in general, things like tea, assumption, like I'm not super worried about those things. You can count those torchetotal fluid intake if you want. So if you're like, I drink 60 ounces of water plus 20 ounces of coffee and then this is like you and add that all up and you're going to be totally okay. So natural, you also have problems with synthetic forms of caffeine versus natural forms of caffeine. Natural forms are pretty okay. Do you have any tea, et cetera? Yeah, all that stuff. No form is where it gets tricky. Always. Like, always, right? So general, just eat real food and things. You're going to be just fine. The last piece to consider is your diet quality matters. Because the fluid content in your food can vary wildly. So something like a bagel might be, you know, five to 10 percent water or something like a water melon is 98%. 95% something in a huge range even meat is very high percentage of fluid intake. I get to really high even after you cook it. There's still a lot of fluid in there. So if you're eating a whole food, mostly whole food based diet, your endogenous hydration is actually pretty high already just from your food. If you're eating a very highly processed dehydrated, oversalted diet, you're way low on hydration just in your food. So you have to factor all these things. And in fact, one of the things that happens to us constantly with folks that go from a highly processed low quality diet to a high quality one. Is they just they're just peeing on stop. And like what the hell is going on? I'm like, well, you actually have brought in 60 additional ounces of water in your diet. The relative of what you used to have and you've gone from 10 grams of sodium. There to four to two. Sometimes one, sometimes it gets to very low because you're not like salt. Are you salting your food? No. Okay. Well, we don't have sodium intake then. Like we're way down. So everything that we're considering is based on that. So let's assume someone's eating a pretty well balanced diet or drinking. Some 60 ounces of water and maybe caffeine coffee and tea, things like that. We don't exactly know the optimal amount of sodium one should intake. It is very clear high sodium concentrations are still associated with a lot of negative health outcomes, especially in combination with poor physical activity and combination with low food quality and other common better days. That's a very bad thing. You need to be very careful about those things. If everything else is okay, we're okay playing with a little bit of higher salt in fact you're probably going to feel better. You're going to feel generally pretty good. You just it seems to be very clear. If you are overweight, highly stressed and you don't have a lot of these things to take off and you have known normal bitterties, you really need to pay attention to salt intake. It can be very nasty. So that being said, what we're generally going to look at folks is are you at least can we categorize you as a low sodium or high sodium sweater? If so, there's a whole list of electrolytes you can look that are going to have something like 200 to 400 milligrams per serving. There's a whole list of these things. If you're low sodium sweater, you're probably going to send you after one of those. If you're a high sodium sweater, there's a lot of electrolytes supplements that are closer to six or eight hundred, even a whole gram per single serving size. So you want to play with that. If you know if you're a low sodium or high sodium sweater, we actually have an episode on salt. We put out that. Or is coming out soon if hasn't come out already, which is. You know when you look at a hazard ratios, your salt intake basically your probability of really bad things happen to you goes way up as you get towards, you know, a lot of sodium and taking a 10, 12 grams a day. And. And this is translate to teaspoons of salt, et cetera, but also very low sodium intake is a problem. No, it's not a perfect you shape. It's kind of a Jay shaped a cover, a kind of hockey stick shape more or less, but how would I know if I'm a low sodium or high sodium sweater. Yeah, what I just kind of like my sweat or have someone else do. Can. Yeah, find a super friend who'll look your sweat for you. Same with how. No, no willing volunteers that I'm aware of, but would I be able to tell? Yeah, you can get sweat testing done. Actually, you have a number of options. The kind of the original one that most of us use the background for many years is called Lebelin. They'll send you out a little patch. You can wear that send it in the lab and the no measure directly in the lab and send it back is 150 bucks or. Did you bring you into low medium and high sodium? They're going to do that, but they're going to give you very they're going to tell you exactly the milligrams. And then they're going to actually tell you like what products is stuff and that they're exactly matched. Do you do this with with professional athletes? We have many times. Yeah, interesting. You can do a more consumer grade version. Gatorade has a patch for 25 bucks. You can get two of them. You can put that patch on your left forearm and download the Gatorade app and you can do it. Work out measure right there and click it over and they'll tell you exactly not only higher low with. Again, they'll tell you the milligrams of sodium that are in your sweat and you can figure out again kind of high medium or just. I do much better on a slightly higher sodium intake. But in my carbohydrate, I do eat carbohydrates on one of those that is pretty moderate, but I try to eat clean food. So I I'd notice and I tend to be slightly low blood pressure. So again to reiterate that the warning there that if somebody is pre hypertension or has hypertension or obesity really do need to be. Careful with your sodium intake, but many people seem to find that they feel better when they increase their sodium intake and they're still in that healthy portion of the hazard ratio. Most of the athletes, I would say in general, we're going to go higher and salt when they come right around their stuff. And we're going to add salt almost always very few times if I got out, we need to cut this back. One of the exceptions is that come in that he like 14 year olds and I'm like, okay, you're 15 milligrams or 15 grams a day because you're eating nothing but. Garbage. So we're like we're going to come down and you're going to feel way better and all this bloating and everything else that's going to happen. Go down. You can do that. They're actually more their biosensors that are coming out. They're not available yet, but they're coming very soon in this space. They're going to be able to give you real time metrics on salt. So you can pay attention to those. I haven't seen one and used one personally, so I don't want to. This about how good our bad it is, but I know that those are coming from a handful of companies. An easy way to do is just look at where a hat or where some sort of headband or something and do your workout. Take it off. If you see a just huge white band or if it's completely clear and that's going to tell you big white band, you're probably a high salt sweater completely clear very little coming out. That's great. And I can see the the posts on Instagram now people showing their their salt band from from from sweating. Yeah. I mean, obviously salt is so essential for so many physiological functions. You don't want to hire too low, but if you're losing more, make sense you would need to take in more. So half of my body weight in ounces as a just foundation of fluid intake coffee and tea could be included in that, but that should probably mostly water or things similar to it. And then during exercise, the how do I want to think about this again, let's say I'm a high salt output, then I'd want to drink maybe 40 ounces water with or more. So let's talk about pre and mid and post. Right. So what to drink, pre if you if you come in having hit these rules you're you're okay and pre workout can be as little as like five or six ounces basically a couple of sips of water. Fine. If you come in poorly hydrated, then you maybe need to go more like 12, but here's the deal if you start off a session in a bad spot, you're not going to catch back up like you're just you're in trouble. Let's say you come in you to you follow direction 500 milligrams salt before 500 milligrams after very easy rule. Pick whatever source you want that's a couple of sprinkles of table salt if you want him a land that's fine, you don't have to him a land is actually a fairly low sodium salt. So it's not the best for for this purposes. If you're higher salters what a little bit more if you want to go choose an electrolyte of which there are infinite. You can look on the packet and it'll tell you 250 milligrams for serving or 400 or 600 or whatever happens. But around 500 pre 500 posts is a very general rule. And then during is thanks to you. My famous galp and equation now that is all over the world. The way I did is I took the literature and I said okay in general the research shows pretty clearly two milligrams per kilogram body weight of 15 minutes seems to put you in a pretty good spot. Most people don't think about kilograms or millions. So can I just run that over and then turns out it's about your body weight divided by 30. And ounces like that's all you have to body weight and pounds divided by 30. Yeah exactly right. So you weigh 200 pounds divided by 30 and that's number of ounces. You don't want to go every 15 or 20 minutes. Getting that amount every 15 to 20 minutes throughout the training. And now in the weight room that's pretty easy to do. Yes, they're arrested and rules. But people will need to do this while running or cycling. And that can cause a little bit of gastric distress. If you're not used to it is outright you can learn to run with it with some water in your belly. 100% the gut is very trainable in a lot of directions, but in terms of fluid as well as carbohydrate, which is another thing that is going to get people. But that's the very trainable. It'll be uncomfortable initially, but you'll quickly get into it. The better solution for those folks. Just come in hydrated and you might not even need any water. You could probably perform just fine. So the ones that don't have as much of an opportunity. You really have to emphasize walking in. We have this problem with like a professional golfers. They have plenty of time to drink water, but they're so focused on the shot and there's a lot of variables coming up. Once they hit their shot and moving on in the next one. They're thinking about, I mean, they're going over scorecard of 185 yards away. Can I go 184.5 yards? Can I go 186 yards? What's the slope of that? What's the wind up here? What's the wind up there? It's just they're just thinking and they just forget. Even though they have four and a half hours. So we have to make sure that they immediately get off the course. We go right into recovery as hard as we possibly can. They wake up the next morning. They're in a good spot. We crush recovery. And now's like, hey, if you can remember to drink this. Great. If not, we're still fine. If it's not a big deal and you have time like a lifter. Because I deal with that problem with fighters too. We can only drink so much in the middle of the fight. A couple of steps over there, but we can't go mix them. Two militer. It's like, can you get a couple of steps in yet? Oh, shit. Forgot. It's not going to happen. So we have to take more of an emphasis before and after. So start your recovery process immediately and then come in the next day. That's your window. And then whatever you can get in during the workout. That's fine, too. If you're a higher salt sweater, set it on 500, 500, 500, maybe go 7.57. 50. If you have a longer bout of exercise, especially if it's hot or humid, then you might want to consider some salt in the workout as well. And 300 milligrams during the workout totally fine. It's enough. If it is a really long workout and it's really hot, and you're going to lose pounds during it. You need a specific strategy. If you're going to lose less than a pound, you don't need to worry about it. You're going to be, is not going to be enough of a detriment for you to really care. So that's kind of a rough rule. Now if you're 200 plus pounds, maybe that number moves from one pound to two pounds. But really the number we're looking at is 1% of your body weight. If you're losing more than 1% of your body weight, we need to start caring. If it's less than 1%, it's not going to really pay that much of a difference. Okay. So for myself, because I don't get super technical. I don't wear any devices besides a wristwatch. Thanks. I do the very attached to this watch or it's attached to me. I suppose. My body weight and pounds divided by two. That's what I'm going to try and get across the entire day as a kind of baseline. And then my body weight and pounds divided by 30 during the workout every 15 or 20 minutes that I'm going to try and consume that amount. And then I definitely do better when I increase the amount of salt that I'm taking in any 500 to 500 milligrams to a gram of salt several times a day actually. But I'm not eating that often which leads me to my other question, which is, I prefer to train fasted or semi-fasted, meaning, first thing in the morning or within an hour or two of waking. What obviously I've been fasting while I'm asleep or having not eaten anything for three or four hours before. I just feel lighter and more energetic. If that works for me, is that okay or should I try and is it better to eat something before one trains? Personal preference. Easy, easy answer there. It depends on, of course, how hard you trained. What the training was like? What sport you're involved with? How many telecoms to such, but in general personal preference for the average person? That probably handles 90% of the questions about that. Cold. Cold showers, ice baths and cold immersion up to the neck. I always, prefaces by saying there are not a lot of studies. But not a lot of controlled studies looking at cold showers because it's harder to control the variables of where people stand. So I would say if you have access to cold immersion of some sort ice bath or cold immersion. Great, but if you don't cold showers will be the next best thing. The lower goes that if you do an ice bath or cold water immersion after strength or hyper-treat training that you are short circling some of that, the lower also goes that cold showers might be okay. My interpretation of those data and that discussion is that all that is probably true, but I have a hard time imagining that the effects are so robust that it can completely prevent strength gains in hyper-treat. And such that my stance for myself is trying to do the cold exposure training away from the strength and hyper-treat training, but if you can't do it any other time, right afterwards. Probably I going to throw my whole system to whack and prevent the improvements in my deluding myself. couple of caveats here. Number one, I would say I have a personal vested interest and cold. I've been around this for a long time. Being involved and being an advisor for XPT and being in this space a long time, I'm a big believer in cold, a special cold water. Deliberate cold exposure. 100%. So that being said, I do think getting into an ice bath. Immediately after a hip-hurtary session is getting pretty close to you just shouldn't have done the session. It is detrimental. Good to know. I wouldn't do it. I guess is the most blunt way to put it. If you're like, hey, I'm not super concerned with growing muscle and I want these other things that come with cold water immersion. Fine, it's not a zero. It's not taking you backwards. How much does it cut you down? I don't know. We don't know. Like that would be a difficult number to come up with. Is it 1% reduction? No, it's more than that. Is it 100? Not even close? I don't know where it lands though. It's enough though for me to go in general. Best practices don't get the ice and be like after a workout. How long should I wait? Well, in theory, the best answer we could give you would be four hours because of what we talked about earlier today of going okay. Immediately, you've got the signaling cascade that takes seconds. You've got a gene expression that's happening in this rough for our window. After the genes have gone off and now you're just going through the protein synthesis process, the signals already there and it's gone back down to baseline. So then reintroducing our introducing cold here is not going to disrupt that signal. That's a very non scientifically founded because we don't know at this point at all. What is very clear though is if you get off your workout go right into the ice, it's probably 10% attenuation of growth. I don't know, maybe more depends on the person. Some people, if you look at the individual data, it's pretty bad. It's enough to where it's like that's a really big deal. The benefits of the ice, I don't think now outweigh the benefits of the hypertrophy training. What about cold showers? I don't think cold showers are going to do much. If you've been on both, you know that this is like we're not probably the same game here. Right. A nice bath or cold water, or true cold water version up to the neck with limbs in if for one to five minutes is a completely different stimulus than in the cold shower. Especially also compared to a similar like cryo. It's not even the same thing here. So in general, I would say don't do those cold shower. I don't really care. Can you work it out so you don't do them the same time? That would be my hope. Right. I would actually prefer you to do the cold before. If you really had to do it, certainly we'll wake you up. You had a adrenaline burst. No, we've played with that actually years ago. I'm doing that. There's actually some fun stuff you can do with the endurance piece with cold stuff, but it's totally not feasible for most people because you're getting water everywhere. They can jump on your bike and just get shit and it's just a giant mess. It's fun. But yeah, I would say walk away for it if you can. That's actually, it's where I stand based on the data based on my intuition and experience. I don't think it's a good thing to do. Now having said that, that's mostly concerned with maximizing hypertrophy. Strength is not as clear. There are some data to show it. It'll actually block strength adaptations. But because of what we talked about earlier, the mechanisms and the drivers are different. And so I don't think it's as big a concern. For strength development, though, I would still generally say if you can get away with staying out of the ice immediately after the workout and you can at least wait a few hours, that's the better approach. The less concerned with strength, more concern with hypertrophy in terms of interference effect. If you can do it on off days or before or any other time, that's the place to land. That's generally when I tried to do it. Just kind of throwing out extreme case because I get asked that question a lot. What about the use of ice bath or cold water immersion or cold shower after endurance training? Okay. So a couple of interesting things here. You mentioned we don't have a tremendous amount of data on cold water immersion overall. So a lot of this is moving. There have been some papers to show that cold water immersion can actually enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and actually even for endurance stuff. It's been shown to that cause improvement and endurance adaptations relative to not. It's not enough for me to be truly confident in that statement yet. I would like to see that repeated, not that I have a problem with the paper or the methodology that I use in that particular study. But this is a weird thing. So I want to see this repeated more often. So I have less concern with doing it immediately post endurance because you could even argue that there may be some benefit. I don't think you need to go out of your way to try to make sure you get an ice immediately afterwards and thinking you're going to get some massive adaptation. We use ice at decent amount when I can get athletes to do it. But this context is different. Number one, when we're in camp and we've got a world title fight coming up or something else. We've just pitched in it at a major baseball game. I am not concerned about hypertrophy. I'm not even concerned of strength development. I am now pushing towards recovery. There's a paradigm that I think is important with all of these things to understand which is, are you pushing for optimization or adaptation? In your pushing for adaptation, you don't want to block the signal for adaptation. This means less recovery. You're not going to feel as good and you probably should be hedging towards stress. When you're pushing for optimization, it's the opposite. So if I'm in season and I had a picture just throw 125 pitches, I'm not trying to cause that adaptation. I'm trying to recover as quickly as possible because four days from now we got to do this again. And I got to do this across 162 games. You're going to play six days, five days in a PGA golf tournament and you're going to have to do it again every week for a bunch of weeks in a row. I need recovery as fast as I possibly can. So I'm from blunting adaptation. Fine. I'm not actually trying to do that. I'm trying to optimize. If you spend all of your time in one of those two areas, you're going to have problems. So you need to be judicious about thinking, is this a point might life or training cycle that I want to cause adaptations or am I trying to optimize? You spend too much time and one of the other ones again, you're going to have problems. So that's in generally how I will treat the ice for all those adaptations. What about heat? Yeah. When an Alfredo in this question differently, because I'm sure there are a number of ways in which heat can short circuit all sorts of things. I mean, heat can in excess can kill you. Yeah. It can shut down fertility. It can in excess, right? It can do all sorts of things, but it can also increase growth hormone, increase basal dilation, improve ones ability to sweat, which can be very beneficial in a number of contexts. Yeah. For the typical for 75% of people, 75% of the time, when do you think heat is most useful? And here I'm referring to dry sauna or wet sauna. I'm not specifically talking about infrared sauna, because the data they're a little unclear to me. And I don't even know that my sense with infrared sauna is as they don't go hot enough for my particular taste. You and I have a similar taste there. Okay. Now, crushing 200 past, I'm not interested. Right. And my sense about infrared sauna is that maybe I haven't seen the data is that, but that a lot of people like it, because they like the way they look in the infrared sauna, it feels cool. It feels like you're doing something unusual. Now, infrared lights are beneficial for other reasons, actually for mitochondrial health and the retinas, the good data. But infrared sauna to me that never goes hot enough. So I'm talking about 200 or hotter, maybe 180 to 20. Obviously, do what safe folks and heat all the warnings about pregnant people not going in size, et cetera. I assume you're lumping in hot water immersion. Hot water immersion. So hot baths, hot sauna. When would you like, when do you think most people could leverage sauna or hot baths to benefit their training and fitness and health? Yeah. Okay. I have a handful of things to say about this topic. One of them is, you never have a hard time convincing people to get hot. Everyone feels good. Like, yeah, can hot bath? Can you take more hot showers? Sure. I can no problem there, right? There are a handful of studies that have looked at this immediately post. And it seems to even augment type of therapy. So after hypergiver training, getting in the sauna for 20 minutes? Yeah, whatever, whatever needs to be. We don't have a good titration. What's the number, minutes, wise? We don't have a temperature titration. Hot shower would would be a second, that would be a week, second, best. I would say it's a very week. So take a hot bath. I think a hot bath is probably a lot closer to what you're looking for. And actually kind of goes back to our initial conversations theoretically. You're just going to aid in blood flow. So you're going to put more nutrients in, more waste product out, metabolic stress, all that stuff is going through. So that's the thought anyways, we far from make sense. Plausible, right? Absolutely, plausible. I'm something people will do. Feels good. I would say with cold and hot, I want to caution you against a couple of things. This is true across off physiology, but you need to be really careful about moving percentages from molecular to outcome. Very careful. So for example, it's easy to see a paper that says, okay, we put you in a hot bath or something and we saw growth hormone increase 300%. That is not going to result in 300% increase in muscle size, right? In fact, 300% might result in absolutely no change in physical size, right? So the and the reason I'm saying this is because there's a lot of people in this space that will misapply the mechanisms. And they'll grossly overestimate what these things can do and what they do do because they'll find something like that. You know, this you've done enough cellular work to in the lab if I see M toward doubled, I think, shit, it didn't work. I need to see 10x increase before I know it's even physiologically relevant. So reading that paper, reading someone's social media post, you're like, wow, I would increase M toward 38% I'm like, well, I didn't work. And you're like, wow, that's huge. That's not 38% increase in muscle size. So that's a very important point I want to make because I'm going to talk about the benefits here in a second. But I do want people to be fooled in thinking that this is some crazy miracle, the same thing with the Sonom. In terms of general health health outcomes, it is a clearly a beneficial thing. This is a really good idea to get hot a lot. It is not a substitute for exercise though. It's a very important distinction. If the options are nothing or Sonom, getting the Sonom, really, really good idea. If the exchange is though, I don't need to work out because I did the Sonom bad. This is not a winning solution. You're nice to know some maniacs that actually work out in the Sonom. Oh, we do. I don't necessarily recommend that. That actually would probably kill a large number of people. But it can be worked. It can be worked up to. Yeah. It's certainly. Yeah. So every time I talk about that, I flag that because it's just too easy to hit that and go, oh, I think Dr. Human said if I just get in the Sonom, I don't have to work out. No, there's words of never going to happen. And I'm definitely not working out in the Sonom. If I'm in the Sonom either sitting or I'm lying down and I'm trying to make it through, I tend to do three 20 minute bouts across the entire week. So I aim for 60 minutes per week of heat exposure. I would be just not a ton. If I said I've never worked out in the Sonom, that's one of those. Yeah, people will do air squads. They'll bring the air down bike in there. I look at the Sonom as kind of a time to get lazy and sweat. Totally fine. Going back to your question. So potential to a plausible aid, we need to see more research on that to really get a doing. I to put this in practice. I think if you try it, very little harm. Struggle to see it downside. If you make sure your hydration's on point, right? Now you got a factor in the fact you just kicked out two or three pounds. If you're at 200 plus pounds, I assume or roughly. If you're in the Sonom for 20 minutes, I would imagine you could do two or three pounds. Yeah, usually I'm I'm hover somewhere around like to 25. Yeah. I drink. I drink at 32 out of the amounts. Right. It's water with the electrolyte solution that's pretty high salt afterwards and sometimes during. Yeah. And sometimes after that, if I do it late in the evening, I'll go to sleep and wake up in the middle of night. Just feeling so parched. It's amazing how much water when loses in the Sonom. Like a normal sweat rate for someone to 25, especially in 20 minutes Sonom Sonom, I would absolutely expect you to do three pounds. Easy without. Like should be really more. Probably even more water. Yeah, you're probably half the water that you need to get. And you mentioned the possible benefits of doing it after strength, high-perature free training, which are make sense for plausible mechanistic reasons, and not no official data there yet. What about after endurance training? Assuming somebody hydrates well enough and they're not overheated from their endurance work could also be a benefit. Yeah. Wow. So more and more what I'm thinking the framework here is in an ideal world. One would train and then do sauna or heat exposure or some kind. In endurance training or strength high-perature, we're training and they do sauna and then do cold exposure on off days or at least four hours away from the from any kind of training or if you had to do it close to train, do it before training. Yeah, I love cold in the morning. We've actually run this experiment on professional athletes, what we do in our tracking with things like HRB, which is a global metric of overall fatigue. Okay, and you're probably talked about that before, but the problems with it, but roughly ideal overall fatigue. HRB in general higher the score the better. Right? So low-air travies fatigue. Well, if you wake up and take your HRB in the morning and then you get into ice, what's going to happen is you're going to see that number of plummet. The second you get out that's going to fall off the earth. It means roughly you've moved into a sympathetic place. Surprising, you get in 30 degree water. You're going to go very sympathetic very quickly. However, if you continue to watch your HRB for 30, 1690 and up to two to three hours post, you will generally see a interim proof HRB score relative to where you started. So it's back to this traumatic stress, right? A really cold shocking exposure will be a net result of you being more relaxed throughout the day in general. And we've seen that now very consistently across years with athletes. So I think it's a great way to start your day. You won't need nearly as much coffee. After spending three minutes and 30 degree water. 30 degrees is pretty pre-done cold. I was in the ocean this morning for about three minutes. It felt like I had to bring it to thermometer, but it felt like somewhere in the low-50s. But 50 in moving has really cold. Yeah. Water is moving. Yeah. That's really cold. That's right. The thermal layer that surrounds you when you sit still in cold water immersion. I'm encouraging people now if they really, I was the joke that people like to look real stoic and tough when they're in there. They're just grinding through with no pain at all. But the stillness is actually reducing the stimulus if they sift around a little bit. You break up that thermal layer. That's where the real action is. We've talked about this for years. Do 50 degrees with a whirlpool jet on? Now I'm impressed. Because that is hard. You sit in 35 degree for three minutes. But with XBT, I can't even tell you how many hundreds of people from all walks of life on all age that we've been able to get in 30, some degree water for three minutes. 50 degrees with a whirlpool going? That number gets very small. Yeah. If you don't have access to a whirlpool, this should be reassuring to you. You can, somebody will say, you know, I don't have access to ice and ice. Can actually get pretty expensive if you're doing a $50 ice bath every day. So you can fill your bathtub with cool to cold water, get in, but just make sure that you keep sifting your limbs. And it's chilly. Yeah. And the studies on the very well-established increases in dopamine and up an effort and that occur in cold water exposure, we're actually done at an hour in 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah. And so you don't necessarily need an ice cold or an ice bath. But immersion is really better than the cold shower. The cold shower is kind of a, it's kind of the espresso shop immersion. Yep. No, that's sort of funny because if you look at most of those initial studies and you think, man, how did they get people to sign up? It's just about 45 minutes in 55 degree water. 55 degrees is cold. Even if it's not moving, if they're going to not spend five minutes in a big, going to go an hour. If you've ever done ice baths at that temperature, you know, like, all right, after a few minutes, it's not that bad, but man, that's a protocol. Yeah, it's kind of an cold endurance protocol because one thing to get in for one minute to three minutes and you know you're getting out, you could sing a song, you could do anything to distract yourself, but 45 minutes to an hour is intense. Maybe they, I don't, I don't think they paid the subjects, but anyway, that study was done in Europe. I forget where it was done, but anyway, they were, they were hardy subjects. I want to talk a bit about overtraining and gauging recovery. Yep. So there are a couple methods that I've heard about and that I use based on some data that I have seen, but mainly discussions with really informed people like yourself, Brian McKenzie, Kelly Starrette, and others. The two that I'm aware of for gauging recovery of the nervous system and kind of systemic recovery are grip strength, especially grip strength on waking in the morning. And the so-called Carmonoxide tolerance test. The ability to do a long-controlled exhale after a few rhythmic deep breaths, just which I'm assuming taps into both McKenzie, one's ability to mechanically control the diaphragm, but also how well one is regulating carbon dioxide. First question is, is this stuff fiction, fact, or a combination of kind of anacdata, as I call it? Are there any peer reviewed published data as your lab working on these things? And am I diluting myself using these tools or are they useful? It's not fiction at all. There are like CO2 tolerance, there's less published data. We've run a study in our lab looking at the association between the CO2 tolerance and what we call straight and stating anxiety. And those are in the publication process is what I'll say. So you can't really talk about that stuff as you know and tell it's out, but in general I'd say like those reason I'm still doing it. I'll just leave it at that. Yeah, assuming it's not a clinical trial, I mean I think sharing preliminary findings as far as we highlight them as preliminary. Yeah. I'm not a reviewer, but I look forward to reading the paper. Yeah, but as you know, scientific ethical, like you need to be careful about sending telling people results before you've gone through that process. Right, which is why I'm flagging this out. These results are not yet peer-reviewed past through the peer review process. So you're hearing about it prior to peer review. Having said that there's enough in that field. I'm not the first one into that field. And so it's I'm very confident that that's a real thing. I'm in terms of actual tracking or covering the big picture is this. When we run through it full analysis, when we when we have an athlete go through our bomb, a bomb molecular athlete program, we're going to run and we're look at three major categories. Okay, category one or what we call visible stressors. And then we have hidden stressors. And then we have recovery capacity. Any time the total stress load outpaces recovery capacity, you're either going backwards in your physical ability or you're reducing adaptability. Now you have levers to pull here. You can reduce stress intake or you can increase recovery capacity. Right? What we want in an ideal situation is you be able to implement the most stress possible because that's the driver of adaptation. We're covered from that. Now we get the most adaptation and adaptation being simply a change. Whatever change you want to be. That's that's our gold standard. Right? It's pine the eye. Some people have endogenous differences. They just recover better. They don't. They're genetic factors. But let's talk about the ones that are manipulatable. If we go to the stress side of it, you want the throttle to be pushed as far down on the ones you want stress from and as far off of the ones you don't want stress so that the adaptation comes in the exact area you want and you're not burning gas and something you don't care about because you're just you're taking that total stress bucket too high. Recovery capacity over there. So here's how you can do that. You can run some analytics and measure what we do with everyone through these these very comprehensive breakdowns to figure out what's that physiology look like hidden and visible and then what's the recovery capacity. Once we have that blueprint, we can now figure out what are the two or three things we need to track that are these indicators of what we call performance anchors. So an anchor is something that kind of drags behind you or below you that slows you down. The analogy being let's say we're going down one of these amazing canyon roads and I won't say which canyon we're in so you can stay hidden here. And your car is going down at a certain velocity and you want to go faster. Most people's is first impulse is to hit the gas, the accelerator. We want to push. Well that's fine but if your foot is on the break and you push the accelerator you might go a little bit faster but number one you're wasting a lot of literal gas to go a little bit faster and two you're burning your engine you might you're going to blow. The easier solution is just take your foot off the break. You're going to go faster by just stopping yourself. Then if that's not fast enough we can hit the accelerator. Everyone wants to just push down right? More stimulus, more optimization, Bing Bing Bing Bing. Here our first analytics are where these performance anchors. What's dragging you back? What's putting down the break? I want to move those two or three things out of the way and now let's see how far you get. Oh look at that. Your recovery capacity has gone way up. Your adaptations are happening faster now when we can do more work because you're recovering quicker. So we're trying to figure out in those buckets and we have a whole host of things that we measure biomarkers and surveys and everything else that we go through to find out what's there. So after we done that now we're just going to track a few of these recovery markers along the way to figure out what's globally happening. So that could mean grip strength. I have some folks who we're going to test grip strength daily. All those we're going to look at HRV or combinations we may look at performance metrics like a force plate. So you're going to do a vertical jump every single day and we're going to see what that's at. We've used the tap test before which is how many times you can tap your fingers fastest possible. It's a rough indicator of center nervous system. In say one minute or two. Exactly. And this is just apps you can do on this. Like the tap as finger faster you can. It's going to say hey you did 60 taps today and your average is 75. I like that because it taps into high no point intended into upper motor and around capacity because a lot of things like grip strength obviously I have to send the deliberate signal to my hand to grip but at some point the lower motor and so you're going to be taking over the majority of the work. Like the signal is probably one and done whereas tapping is going to be repetitive sending of signals from upper motor neurons. So some of the athletes I work with we track blood every day. We track urine every day. We track ideally a combination of subjective and objective measures. Everything from how did you feel last night to environmental sensors of their bedroom full PSG is going on running like actual safe diagnostics not or ring nothing against or but like full analytics and some of them it's as simple as how you feel today and what was your vertical jump. Right so we're going to put people on a position to succeed. We're going to figure out what's the lever that they need to pull as well as what's their aptitude, what sport do they end, what can we realistically get away with and some of them will take machines with them and we'll do blood every day and urine and all kinds of stuff and some of them it's a lot lower. For myself I'm not as I mentioned before I'm not a big fan of devices trying to where there was wristwatch I tend to go off feel which is not it's not the ideal objective way to gauge things but part of my reasoning for this is my colleague from the psychology department Dr. Alia Chrome has done some studies where they've given people deliberately given people false feedback about their sleep. So told people you didn't sleep very well or they've told people you slept really well and performance can be driven in the expected direction based on feedback independent of how well people slept it in sleep. Now that doesn't mean you can take someone that only slept two hours or was about every 30 seconds because of aptitude and tell them they slept great and they're going to perform great cognitive tasks but you can't take someone who slept very well tell them that their recovery quotient wasn't very good and their their output is going to be worse and that's my concern about a lot of devices out there not to name specific devices but it's still unclear to the general public what the specific algorithms are to generate these recovery scores right and so many of the things that reportedly track sleep aren't tracking sleep good tracking heart rate and breathing which are correlates of sleep depth but that's different and again I'm not knocking those I think the sleep trackers if nothing else have provided a forum whereby people are very conscious of getting good sleep it's sort of like knowing the total clerk and take of your food people go wow I'm actually eating a lot more than I thought or less in some cases but often the case is that it's more so I think for the typical person I'm wondering whether or not like myself because I'm not a competitive athlete or certainly not a professional athlete competitive with myself I suppose but no one else. Morning pulse rate I tend to take when I'm waking if I wake out of a really stressful dream I might relax a little bit and then just take my pulse rate kind of get a range and see if it's spiking for whatever reason I don't tend to measure strength although I've heard you can just use a classic scale, old fashioned scale with the fingernail now old fashioned or some other more technical devices probably getting there's a low cost one yeah and then the carbon dioxide tolerance test so we haven't really talked about that in in specific ways my understanding of it is it's four deep slow breaths in through the nose out through the nose and then a big inhale as max and then time duration of exhale through the nose and then stopping the stopwatch at the point where longs are empty not necessarily as long as one could hold the breath did I get that right? Pretty much okay and I guess we should credit you and Brian McKenzie yeah those guys yeah for good and and the folks under Brian's umbrella for really establishing this as a really good metric when and how can I use the carbon dioxide tolerance test to gauge recovery upon waking post training session yeah without any good time number one answer is whatever you do do be consistent so do it under like any good science experiment do it under the exact same conditions as you can that generally means somewhere in the morning because that's when you're probably going to have the most control most ability going so yeah like you would take any HRV or other metric wake up get in a control get stabilized take your metric got it gonna be pretty good got it sodium bicarb making soda um rumor has it and data has it that it can actually be a pretty effective training tool very effective can you explain a little bit of about how it works and how one might explore using sodium bicarb to enhance training output in a couple of during contact yeah so there's a handful of these ubiquitously effective supplements for performance sodium bicarb and it's one of them it's a very ingenious idea because it's so simple effectively most contraction happens because enzymatic function occurs within a fairly specific PA trench right so if it gets extremely acidic it doesn't like it and so whether you're running through aerobic like pulses or anaerobic or anything else all these things require even ATP hydrolysis requires ATPase and enzyme has the enzymes don't function well outside of this fairly special range so what happens is generally fatigue this the sensations of fatigue are actually caused by some signal that hey we're starting to run on a pH we're getting in the wrong range you're not out of gas usually you're not too low on oxygen you're not running low on muscle glycogen yet you're typically going to see sign their feel signals of fatigue way prior to that mostly being pH issues that being said what if we could regulate pH better enter bicarb in it right so um without going too far in metabolism effectively what happens is you take an inhale and you're mostly breathing in oxygen O2 when you exhale you're breathing out CO2 so the difference is you've gained a carbon somehow well all of your carbohydrates in your body come in the form of long carbon chains in fact that's what a carbohydrate means it is a one carbon molecule that has one water molecule attached to the carbon that has been hydrated in the case of like glucose blood sugar that's a six carbon molecule right in terms of fat which are the only two places you're going to get most of your cellular energy carbohydrates into that that is also a big long block in chain of carbons so whether you're getting energy from fat or carbohydrate you're going to split those atoms so in other words you've got six carbons attached to each other and in this part of chemistry it's exorganic so when you break that carbon bonds so break one of those carbons off from the other that's going to release energy just like if you had a pencil and here and I snapped it you go bang and pop I broke the bonds that were connecting that graphite the next piece of graphite and that released energy because I put energy into the system etc. Okay as a result though we've now had you know say five six carbons chain together we broke one off the end which is not how it works but making the point and now you have one free floating carbon use that energy release to then go make ATP to then go make your muscles contract but now you've got carbon floating around you can associate free floating carbon with being at a higher set of global it's not going to happen the only way that you're going to go through this process is if your body says do we have an oxygen molecule available that we can find this to immediately yes we do that carbon attaches to that oxygen molecule you can't just put CO2 in the blood because of what we just talked about so you're going to bind it through this by carbon at process it's going to go through your blood it's going to go into the lungs it's going to go back into its carbon oxygen molecules going to trans go through the alveoli into the lungs and you're going to exhale so you went from carbon to this by carbon system back into carbon exhale so inhale oh two plants go the opposite by the way so they're going to breathe in the CO2 they're going to cleave off that carbon stack those carbon together and that's how they get larger in your in your blood those six carbon chains are called glucose if we store that in your muscle we call it glycogen so we take a bunch of glucose and stack it together and a plant we call that starch that's the fact that we go to this right so you take a bunch of carbon from the atmosphere stuck it all together and that's a starch if you want to do it in the form of fruit we take that starch like from the ground you put it up through the tree go all the way up to the top put it into the flower break it up into these big huge chunks of starch into little forms called fruit dose or glucose that's why fruit has fruit dose in it and that's why tubers and stuff have starch in basically starch in an animal is going to be like a dinner nurse okay all that to say if that's happening and we know that a byproduct specifically of anaerobic glycosis meaning the breakdown of carbohydrates for fuel typically in a very fast pace with low oxygen availability the downside of that equation is acid production we know that that's a problem because I started the conversation off there intentionally so what if we could reduce the acid build up and I you know how pH kind of works I went and kind of double negatives there right you know too much acid build up then could we prolong and sustain energy and a more effective pace especially in this anaerobic interval kind of environment and again that's important because in those things failure is not a result of running out of fuel or oxygen it's a result of fatigue building up way too quickly is that also true for resistance training there's maybe more of the the creatine phosphate system that can be an issue it could simply be an issue of force production you just don't have enough force you're not out of energy you just can't muster enough force you do enough reps then it's going to be an issue there our creatine phosphate would be the big winner depending um so to come back a little bit to the beginning then I'll I'm circling this all together intentionally all right well the way that we produce energy is going to be in two primary categories anaerobic and aerobic meaning with oxygen anaerobic meaning without in terms of muscle contraction you're pretty much talking about carbohydrates or fat now fat is going to be exclusively aerobic meaning I'm going to use fat from the entire body roughly equally so you're doing a sprint up a hill and your hamstrings are your glutes your quadron fire you can't you're not just going to use the fat that's directly in those hamstrings you're going to lose it from the entire body it has to go through life pulses so it's in this stored form an out of post tissue it's got to get broken down put into blood blood's going to have to go through your body get taken up into muscle taken up through muscle into the mitochondria then we're going to have to go through this process called beta oxidation so remember carbohydrates and glucose especially is a six carbon molecule fat if it's in the form of a try glyceride it is a three carbon glycerol backbone and three you know try one two three fatty acids three carbon backbone and those fatty acids are just big long chains of carbon that's all it is right so we're going to break that thing down put it in the blood move it up move it into our mitochondria you can't walk those things across the mitochondria wall they're too big so what you have to do is cleave them off in a little chunks and it turns out we break them off in a two carbon chunks we call it beta as in two move those in a mitochondria that can go through this little thing called crebsycular triaxialic acid cycle and you kick out a bunch of energy out of that you had two carbons so as a result of that process you're going to generate two carbon dioxide but remember you can only go through that process if oxygen is available because you have to be able to play so's carbons onto something or acid gets up way too high too fast this is one of the reasons why fat is a nice fuel source but it's very slow it takes physical time to move from the back of your shoulder and your blood down your hamstring uptake uptake uptake in addition it's required oxygen availability if you need energy faster you simply don't have the time to bring in the oxygen transport it through go through capillaries exchange through attissue etc. carbohydrate on the other hand is going to be stored locally in the exercising muscle cell and specifically in the cytoplasm as glycogen as glycogen in the store in there so what's going to happen initially your initial demands for exercise or for fuel are going to come from the glycogen stored within the muscle fiber itself it's just going to break right there and you're going to be off the races so you have the six carbon molecules you're going to break it into two separate three carbon molecules okay boom that breaking provides you a tiny bit of energy very small but some now you're going to take those two three carbon molecules and you want to be able to oxidize them because that's your only next step but in order to do that you got to go those in a mitochondria so you got to break one of those molecules off so then you'll be back to your two carbon molecule just like you did with fat that's going to go into mitochondria and then it's going to go through the exact same Krebs cycle two carbons etc but hold on if you don't have sufficient oxygen or sufficient mitochondria availability and you're stuck at that two three carbon place what do you do you have problems right now we have to say okay wait a minute we have two a three carbon molecule and we have a bunch of this acid build up now acid functionally is is hydrogen that that's what pH potential hydrogen is what pH stands for right so if hydrogen is building up as a byproduct of musculation attraction and then you're having the three carbon molecule what it can actually do is grab one of those hydrogens and those three carbon molecules whether we are called peruvid or peruvic acid right if you take a peruvic acid and you grab hydrogen put it on top of it we now have a different name for it it's called hydrogen peroxide lactate bingo right that's what lactate lactac acid is right so we've now built that up so number one reason why lactate is not causing your fatigue it's actually preventing it and that it doesn't bunch of other really cool stuff but the point is that system calling the last so so long that gets overwhelmed very quickly what are you going to do with the rest of this hydrogen well if you started off in a normal pH range you don't have very far to go before you've now gone into that level of too much acidity if you start off in a more basic and and basic at all means simple I mean chemistry right and more alkaline then that same amount of increase in pH is no longer now just put you back in your physiological range so sodium by carbon it whether taking as a cream or a powder or baking soda or anything else can simply put you in a more alkaline state even out cutely so this is something you can take right now before you're your workout and you're going to delay what we call delay the progression of fatigue and how would people start to approach this practice you I my understanding is you can do this with common you know store-bought baking soda no question there's always a concern about gastric distress that it's a very effective laxative sometimes in an unwanted laxative effect but how would one approach this before let's say I'm I'm going to I'm doing the mild repeats exercise mild repeats protocol that we talked about earlier I'm doing that for a few months and now I want to try the sodium by carb yep approach I'm well hydrated hopefully I'm well rested I'm ready to go when am I going to drink this sodium by carb solution what how would I make the solution let's say I take 10 ounces of water yeah how much by carb do I want to sodium by carb should I put in there can we come up with a half a teaspoon is a teaspoon um here's how I'm going to tell you you will thank me by starting lower you can always go more later so a little pinch you cannot go backwards how about I start with a quarter teaspoon fine half honestly half is fine half a teaspoon totally fine dissolve that yeah plug that down I read a study recently that showed that people will hit their the peak benefits of this at different times but it's somewhere if I if memory serves me correctly somewhere between 16 90 minutes later so I might want to drink it on the way to the track it can it can be as low as 20 okay so maybe um as I get to the track and someone to do some warm up with some walk and jogging I say 45 minutes okay that's as I just very rough standard but yeah you're right it is it is individualized and you probably want to play with that a little bit if not just somewhere and then a road of 20 doing our okay and then um the perceived and real fatigue if done correctly the perceived and real fatigue ought to be reduced yes I can do more work without feeling exhausted will I feel less of a lactate burn yeah done in air quotes for those listening I realize that's a very crude way to describe a complex physiological process yeah fantastic can sodium bicarb be used repeatedly for longer duration training yep and if I were going to use it with um weight training for whatever reason maybe I'm doing circuit type training or I'm doing the superset type strength training that you talked about before push pull push pull which is a little bit more cardiovascular lead demanding yep then maybe I'd sip that throughout the workout make sure there's a bathroom nearby it sounds like because I do I am aware that many people get pretty serious gastric distress very quickly okay great well sounds like an amazing training tool um I really appreciate you sharing because I think it's it's one that doesn't get a lot of airtime these days because it's been around but um sounds like it has some pretty impressive. Yeah you know it's sort of funny about that is I mean I get it pop culture is what it is but still to this day if you want to talk about sort of your most effective general health slash performance supplementation it's the same three to four to five you know within there it's because it work really well without going into the chemistry of each one in the practice you wanted because I definitely want to get you back to talk about nutrition and supplementation oh yeah at some point but I think we need a full couple of hours to get that right at least um if you as a teaser would you mind just listing off the other supplements that you have found are very effective for for many people so sodium by carburbaking sodas one what are some of the other ones yep we'll go kind of reverse order beta-aligning is another very classically effective one similar idea of sodium by carbine so it's it's going to beta-aligning is gonna come in it's gonna be converted and stored as with called carnesine and the muscle and carnesine is an intro cellular buffer so in other words it's just going to delay the buildup of acid um so fatigue blocker if you will so very effective very cheap very safe well studied the top one though all of them by far that has an incredibly strong safety profile it has it is a cheap it is a simple form to get has a important magnitude of effect and is effective across multiple domains of physical health and performance and it is because of that it is my crown jewel it is in my opinion without question they Michael Jordan of all supplementation and that's creating monoghidry it affects so many things we typically think about it as it's muscle stuff right you you've talked kind of you quickly we're talking about the creating phosphate system but we have to realize the mass majority research on creating phosphate is not in support performance and has not been for 20 years it's in clinical and it has everything from effects on the neurological system to there have been associations to mental health and depression and to be very clear I am certainly not saying you can take creating and cure anything and I'm not saying it's going to stop you from depression or anything but I'm saying there's there's a lot of research in these areas and there's a reason people are doing it yeah I completely agree and if you're willing I'd love to have you back for us to do a discussion on creating and the brain or creating in the nervous system there'll be a lot of fun and maybe we can do a kind of a journal club and advance of that for those who don't know a journal club is where scientists read a bunch of papers and then argue about them discuss them and try and extract the kind of agreed upon center of mass if you will I think I've long been taking five grams of cream on a hydrate per day for mainly for the cognitive effects it I sense an effect that's all you see anecdot but I think there are a lot of data out there as you can see there's a tough that you're not crazy there's enough there and in fact there's enough mechanism now to understand the metabolic needs people think the mental I'm a muscle guy right so I'm going to think about the metabolism needed to fuel muscle but we forget cells immune cells run blood cells nerve cells astrocytes brain all this stuff requires energy and it's all going through metabolism super interesting we will do the deep dive on that soon I have a final question for you you're involved in a really interesting I think really cutting edge project that I first learned about from you I don't know of anyone else doing anything as forward thinking and frankly as relevant to the general population because of my interest in people getting better sleep and learning how to do that avoiding stress and learning how to do that tell us a little bit about what I believe is called absolute rest right so this is something that we've been playing with behind the scenes for a long time and this typically how high performance stuff works right people want exclusivity and and so this has been built um effectively what happened is a friend of mine Cody Burkart I don't know if you know Cody but a famedown in Texas yeah NASA NASA got it yeah do know Cody wonderful just down the road thinker everyone's interested in sleep right and for forever I would cover using with athletes but everything available tells you how you're sleeping nothing can tell you why you're sleeping that way and so we we got together and bolder and then I met his former colleagues computer science folks Harvard MD and some really impressive tech folks and we were just thinking about an idea and we came up with we started realize the problems right we used first principle thinking it's one of my favorite approaches if you've not familiar with that go google that like that's just a recipe to solve problems this first principle thinking and we just started to think about like man all the sleep tech is is there it's real I don't need to convince people that they need sleep everyone's done that you need high quality sleep but how can I provide solutions and with the people I work with I can't just tell them your testosterone's down or your sleep's down or I need to be able to be like this is down and here's why and here's our solution that that's how our high performance world works so enter absolute rest this is saying okay what are the actual nodes that go into high effective high quality sleep number one is psychology so there has to be some sort of screening diagnostic for are you not sleeping because of simply you can't control yourself and you've done a wonderful job of giving people tools or if you can't quite your mind before sleep to this if you wake up and you can't go back to sleep here a bunch of things right so we have some screens that we can do and there's some of stuff we can do to analyze this is a psychological issue let's say it's not you're on a control and we have different tricks we use and stuff on to Mac but it's not that okay is it physiology which is no number two do we know what your dopamine levels are like do we know what your serotonin levels are like what's melatonin look like what's this what's adrenaline what's cortisol cortisol being the primary driver what what is this relationship dha where are these things at so we're gonna measure all that and and track that we're gonna measure that during the day prior to sleep we're gonna measure that next morning and even sometimes throughout sleep and we're gonna figure out as a physiology problem if it is then we have clear corrections if not we're gonna go on the next up which is is this possibly pathology so you have some sort of sleep disorder we're gonna run full people it's called psg so polystyreneography a full the exact same stuff you would get in a sleep clinic it's a sensor that's gonna go on measuring eg and eog we're gonna have muscle activation sensor to see if your legs are moving and everything else is going on and we're gonna get a full diagnostic and if any of us are done this the amount of sleep issues that are happening in people that they don't even realize is extraordinarily high so we're gonna figure this out one very quick example we just did this with a professional athlete and he was having like 280 roughly of these episodes per night and to be categorizes in episode they have to meet these four specific criteria oxygen saturation ventilation changes brain changes the sector and any hit that over 200 times the night and what this technology allowed us to do is figure out what position did all these things occur in well in his particular case most of them are happening with zana's back and so we bought a very simple like pillow basically they went on his back that kept him from sleeping on his back and we saw an 85% reduction in sleep awakeness issues the very first night and we did that testosterone eventually tripled after three months by just improving sleep and all we did is move him on his left or right side so a huge improvements just by understanding where the problem occurred and why it occurred there we didn't have to change hardly anything else he had the basic hygiene stuff down then temperature and all that stuff and he had his chili pad and all that to keep the thing cool we couldn't fix it when he years by the way this took us two years of just trying everything we're like man and it was just like a wish wish we could get you to sleep better and we pulled out every trick I knew and it's just as soon as we built this dinner like oh my god it's all he's not overweight by the latest and he's not iron deficient isn't up any of these other clothe a classical symptoms that are associated with batsley supplementation everything we've done a thousand protocols that fixed it overnight so if it's not psychology it's not physiology and it's not pathology then last one that people don't have any idea about his environment and so what you don't realize is we have a box we can sit right next to your bed you just plug it in you don't have to do anything and it's gonna run full environmental scents so it's gonna look at the temperature in your room it's gonna look at the humidity in your room it's gonna look at the volatile organic acids it's usually things that are seeping out from your mattress it's gonna look at particulates in the air and possible allergens and things that are floating around that are closing your nose off so you can't sleep at night and now you're mouth breathing and you've talked a lot I'm sure on the previous episode about why that's bad it's gonna look at your CO2 cloud so we've talked a we've already set this point up right you're inhaling O2 but then you're exhaling CO2 well during the day and when we're conversing you have a quite a bit of force with that acceleration right but at night it's just barely seeping out of your mouth so what happens is CO2 sends to cloud up and build around your face and then you end up re-breathing that CO2 and this can cause a large number of sleep problems because you're simply re-reading in the panic whether you fully awake or just kick out of a sleep stage the CO2 around your face is a big issue this stuff has all been known by the way with the astronauts for a very long time it just hasn't translated into the commercial spaces of course gone to our high performer space so we can measure that as well and then we can figure out like for the most extreme we can actually come into a bedroom and build an entire sleep optimization set up and trolling entire thing but for most folks the minimum we can do is run full of diagnostics and check is this environmental related is it pathologies or something else so is this a commercial device that people can eventually access it is now so where can people learn more about absolute rest absolutely rest calm very cool and just as a whole disclosure I wasn't aware that you had done this prior to today we you mentioned I was like to ask people scientists or otherwise I was I love to ask you what are you most excited about lately and this sounds like an amazing technology and just to be really clear that's not like something we're working on that's that's landed that's landed we're ready to go great well and that's one of the things I appreciate about you is that you're you're willing to sometimes speculate but you always say it's speculation but in general you're you seem like to kind of guy where if you're gonna be public facing about something if you're gonna make a statement there's gotta be quite a bit behind it you're not gonna lead to the in 10 years we might be able to do this or in five years you're very data driven kind of guy yeah well the people I work with we need answers all right we don't have that time frame and we typically have like hey we start the season four weeks yeah so that's just more about well as I said I appreciate that about you but it is but one of the many things I appreciate I think the listeners and I can well appreciate on the basis of today's discussion what a enormous wealth of information you are how clear and and and importantly you communicate that information and also how you can take a huge cloud of information and still distill it into protocols that ought to work for 75 percent of people 75 percent of the time which is an immensely valuable thing to do so for me and from the listeners I just want to say thank you so much for taking the several now hours I lose track of time which is a good reflects good all good things several hours to take a break from teaching take a break from research take a break from the other important commitments of your life and really share with us all this incredible information I'm so so grateful my pleasure man I'm fine I'm glad we finally got to connect this has been a long time with making it has and I'm going to I'm going to bring the breathing protocols to my training I'm going to start doing more of the endurance type and interval type training I'm going to start moving when I do heat I'm going to start moving when I do cold I might even start throwing some sodium bicarbon to a very small amount of sodium bicarbon into some water before I train and listen Andy professor Andy Galpin thank you ever so much I'd like to learn more about his work and learn further information about exercise science from Dr. Galpin please find him on Instagram at Dr. Andy Galpin you can also find him on Twitter at the same handle Dr. Andy Galpin spelled with one L and if you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our YouTube channel that's a terrific zero-cost way to support us please also subscribe to the

or guests that you'd like to see me interview please put that in the comment section on YouTube we do read all the comments in addition please check out the sponsors mentioned at the beginning of today's podcast that's the best way to support this podcast we also have a patreon it's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman and there you can support the podcast at any level that you like during today's conversation and on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast we discuss supplements while supplements aren't necessary for everybody many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like sleep and focus and energy and many other features of our physiology and mental functioning there are some important issues to consider when considering supplements one of those issues is the quality of the ingredients for that reason we've partnered with thorn THO R and E because thorn supplements have the highest possible standards with respect to the quality of the ingredients they include if you'd like to see the supplements that I take you can go to thorn that's THO R and E dot com slash the letter u slash Huberman and there you'll see the supplements that I take and you can get 20% off any of those supplements if you navigate further into the thorn site through that website thorn dot com slash u slash Huberman you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements that thorn makes if you're not already following Huberman Lab on Instagram and Twitter please do so there I discuss science and science-based tools some of which overlap with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast but much of which is distinct from the information covered on this podcast thank you once again for joining me for my discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin and as always thank you for your interest in science."
vid00014," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman. Dr. Jack Feldman is a distinguished professor of neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is known for his pioneering work on the neuroscience of breathing. We are all familiar with breathing and how essential breathing is to life. We require oxygen and it is only by breathing that we can bring oxygen to all the cells of our brain and body. However, as the work from Dr. Feldman and colleagues tells us, breathing is also fundamental to organ health and function at a enormous number of other levels. In fact, how we breathe, including how often we breathe, the depth of our breathing and the ratio of inhales to exhales, actually predicts how focused we are, how easily we get into sleep, how easily we can exit from sleep. Dr. Feldman gets credit for the discovery of the two major brain centers that control the different patterns of breathing. Today you'll learn about those brain centers and the patterns of breathing that control and how those different patterns of breathing influence all aspects of your mental and physical life. What's especially wonderful about Dr. Feldman and his work is that it not only points to the critical role of respiration in disease, in health and in daily life, but he's also a practitioner. He understands how to leverage particular aspects of the breathing process in order to bias the brain to be in particular states that can benefit us all. Whether or not you are a person who already practices breath work or whether or not you're somebody who simply breathes to stay alive. By the end of today's discussion, you're going to understand a tremendous amount about how the breathing system works and how you can leverage that breathing system toward particular goals in your life. Dr. Feldman shares with us his own particular breathing protocols that he uses and he suggests different avenues for exploring respiration in ways that can allow you, for instance, to be more focused for work, to disengage from work and high stress endeavors to calm down quickly. And indeed, he explains not only how to do that, but all the underlying science in ways that will allow you to customize your own protocols for your needs. And I suggest that we bring on the human lab podcast are considered at the very top of their fields. Today's guest, Dr. Feldman, is not only at the top of his field, he founded the field. Prior to his coming into neuroscience from the field of physics, there really wasn't much information about how the brain controls breathing. There was a little bit of information, but we can really credit Dr. Feldman and his laboratory for identifying the particular brain areas that control different patterns of breathing and how that information can be leveraged towards health, high performance, and for combating disease. So today's conversation, you're going to learn a tremendous amount from the top researcher in this field. It's a really wonderful and special opportunity to be able to share his knowledge with you, and I know that you're not only going to enjoy it, but you're going to learn a tremendous amount. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis is a company that makes new tropics. I've talked before on the podcast and elsewhere about the fact that I don't really like the term new tropics, which means smart drugs. Because smart means many different things in many different contexts. You've got creativity, you've got focus, you've got tasks switching. So the idea that there would be one pill or one formula that could make us smarter and better at all those things at once just doesn't stand up to logic. In fact, different chemicals in different brain systems underlie our ability to be creative or our ability to task which or to be focused. And that's the basis of Thesis. Thesis is a company that makes targeted new tropics for specific outcomes. In other words, specific new tropics to get your brain into states that are ideal for what you're trying to accomplish. Thesis uses very high quality ingredients, many of which I've talked about before on the podcast such as DHA, Ginko, Boloba and Fosfotidal Steering. I talked about those in the ADHD podcast. Those are some of the ingredients in their so-called logic formula. There's a lot of research showing that Ginko, Boloba can be very helpful for increasing levels of focus and even for people with ADHD. I can't take it when I take it, I get really bad headaches and I know some people who do and some people who don't get headaches when they take Ginko, Boloba. This is a great example of why new tropics need to be personalized to the individual. Thesis gives you the ability to try different blends over the course of a month and discover which new tropic formulas work best for your unique brain chemistry and genetics. And which ones are best for particular circumstances. So they have a formulation for instance, which is motivation. They have another formulation which is clarity. They've got another formulation which is logic. And each of these is formulated specifically to you and formulated to a specific endpoint or goal state of mind for your particular work. So as a consequence, the formulations that you arrive at will have a very high probability of giving you the results that you want. In addition to that detailed level of personalization, Thesis takes a step further by offering free consultations with a brain coach to help you optimize your experience and file in your favorite and best formulas. I've been using Thesis for close to six months now and I can confidently say that their new tropics have been a total game changer for me. My favorite of the formulations is their motivation formula that they've tailored to me. When I use that formula, I have very clear state of mind. I have even energy and I use that early in the day until the early afternoon to get the bulk of my most important work done. To get your own personalizing your tropic starter kit, you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman Take a three minute quiz and Thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month. That's takethesis.com slash Huberman and use the code Huberman, check out to get 10% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral and protein. Vitamin mineral and probiotic foundational needs. There's now a wealth of data showing that not only do we need vitamins and minerals, but we also need to have a healthy gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is a set of nerve connections that link the microbiota literally, Microbacteria that live in our guts and that are healthy for us with our brain function. And our brain is also talking to our gut in a bi-directional way. And that conversation is vital for metabolism, for the endocrine system, meaning the hormonal system, and for overall mood and cognition. There's just so much data now pointing to the fact that we need a healthy gut microbiome and a healthy brain gut access as it's called. By taking Athletic Greens once or twice a day, I can get the vitamins and minerals and the probiotics needed for all those systems to function optimally. And again, it tastes great. It's great for me. In fact, if people ask me what's the one supplement that I should take and they can only take one supplement, I recommend Athletic Greens for all the reasons I mentioned. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to atletagreens.com-human to claim a special offer. They're giving you five free travel packs, which are these little travel packs to make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road or in the car or on the plane, et cetera. And a year supply of vitamin D3K2. There is also a wealth of evidence showing that vitamin D3 is vital to our overall health and K2 is important for cardiovascular health and other systems as well. Most of us are not getting enough vitamin D3 or K2, even if we're getting some sunshine. So again, if you go to atletagreens.com-slash-human, you get the five free travel packs, a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Athletic Greens.com-slash-human is where you go to claim that special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that's supported by 25 published studies and benefits from over 600,000 five star reviews. I've long been a believer in meditating. There's so much data now pointing to the fact that regular meditation leads to reduced stress levels, heightened levels of focus, better tasks switching and cognitive ability. It just goes on and on. I mean, there are literally thousands of peer-reviewed studies now in quality journals pointing to the benefits of having a regular meditation practice. The problem with meditation is many people, including myself, have struggled with sticking to that practice. With Headspace, it makes it very easy to start and continue a meditation protocol. The reason for that is they have meditations that are of different lengths and different styles, so you don't get bored of meditation. Even if you just have five minutes, there are five minute meditations. If you've got 20 minutes, which would be even better, there are 20 minute meditations. Ever since I started using Headspace, I've been consistent about my meditation. I do meditation anywhere from five to seven times a week in my best weeks and sometimes that drops to three. And then I find with Headspace, I can quickly get back to doing meditation every day because of the huge variety of great meditations that they have. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com-specialoffer. And if you do that, you can get a free one-month trial with Headspace's full library of meditations for every situation. That's the best deal offered by Headspace right now. So again, if you're interested, go to headspace.com-specialoffer. One quick mention before we dive into the conversation with Dr. Feldman. During today's episode, we discuss a lot of breath work practices. And by the end of the episode, all those will be accessible to you. However, I'm aware that there are a number of people out there that want to go even further into the science and practical tools of breath work. And for that reason, I want to mention a resource to you. There is a cost associated with this resource, but it's a terrific platform for learning about breath work practices and for building a number of different routines that you can do or that you could teach. It's called our breath work collective. I'm not associated with the breath work collective, but Dr. Feldman is an advisor to the groove. And they offer daily live, guided breathing sessions, and an on-demand library that you can practice any time free workshops on breath work. And these are really developed by experts in the field, including Dr. Feldman. So as I mentioned, I'm not on their advisory board, but I do know them in their work and it is of the utmost quality. So anyone wanting to learn or teach breath work could really benefit from this course, I believe. If you'd like to learn more, you can click on the link in the show notes or visit our breathcollective.com slash Huberman and use the code HubermanitCheckout. And if you do that, they'll offer you $10 off the first month. Again, it's our breathcollective.com slash Huberman to access the our breath collective. And now for my conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman. Thanks for joining me today. It's a pleasure to be here, Andrew. Yeah, it's been a long time coming. You're my go-to source for all things, respiration. I mean, I breathe on my own, but when I want to understand how I breathe and how the brain and breathing interact, you're the person I call. Well, through my best, as you know, there's a lot that we don't understand, which still keeps me employed and engaged, but we do know a lot. When we start off by just talking about what's involved in generating breath. And if you would, could you comment on some of the mechanisms for rhythmic breathing versus non-rhythmic breathing? Okay, so on the mechanical side, which is obvious, everyone, we want to have a flow in inhale, and we need to have a flow out. And the reason we need to do this is because for body metabolism, we need oxygen. And when oxygen is utilized through the metabolic process, we produce carbon dioxide. And so we have to get rid of the carbon dioxide that we produce in particular, because the carbon dioxide affects the S-a-base balance of the blood, the pH. And all living cells are very sensitive to what the pH value is. So your body is very interested in regulating that pH. So we have to have enough oxygen for our normal metabolism, and we have to get rid of the CO2 that we produce. So how do we generate this air flow? Well, they are comes into the lungs. We have to expand the lungs. And as the lungs expand, basically it's like a balloon that you would pull apart, the pressure inside that balloon drops, and air will flow into the balloon. So we expand, pull a pressure on the lung to pull it apart, that lowers the pressure in the air sacs called alveoli, and air will flow in because pressure outside the body is higher than pressure inside the body when you're doing this expansion. When you're inhaling, what produces that? Well, the principal muscle is a diaphragm, which is sitting inside the body just below the lung. And when you want to inhale, you basically contract the diaphragm and it pulls it down. And as it pulls it down, it's inserting pressure forces on the lung, along one's to expand. At the same time, the rib cage is going to rotate up and out. And therefore expanding the cavity, the thoracic cavity. At the end of inspiration, and the normal conditions when you're addressed, you just relax. And it's like pulling on a spring. You pull down a spring and you let go and it relaxes. So you inhale and you exhale. Inhale, relax and exhale. So the exhale is passive. At rest it's passive. We're getting into what happens when you need to increase the amount of air you bring in because your ventilation, your metabolism goes up like doing exercise. Now the muscles themselves, skeletal muscles don't do anything unless the nervous system tells them to do something. They contract. So there are specialized neurons in the spinal cord and above the spinal cord, the region called the brain stem, which go to respiratory muscles. In particular, for inspiration, the diaphragm and the external and the coastal muscles in the rib cage. And they contract. So these respiratory muscles, these sensory muscles. Become active. And then we come active for a period of time. Then they become silent. And when they become silent, the muscles then relax back to their original resting level. Where does that activity in these neurons that innovate the muscle, which are called motor neurons, where does that originate? Well, this was a question that's been banding around for thousands of years. And when I was a beginning assistant professor, it was fairly high priority for me to try and figure that out because I wanted to understand where this rhythm of breathing was coming from. And you couldn't know where I was coming from until you knew where it was coming from. And I didn't phrase that properly. You couldn't understand how it was being done until you know where to look. So we did a lot of experiments which I can go into detail. And finally found there was a region in the brain stem. That's once again this region sort of above the spinal cord, which was critical for generating this rhythm. It's called the pre-buttsing of complex. And we could talk about how that was named. This small site which contains in humans a few thousand neurons. It's located on either side and works in tandem. And every breath begins with neurons in this region beginning to be active. And those neurons then connect ultimately to these motor neurons going to the diaphragm and to the external into castles, causing them to be active and causing this inspiratory effort. When the neurons in the pre-buttsing of complex finish their burst of activity, then inspiration stops. And then you begin to exhale because of this passive recall of the lung and ribcage. Could I just briefly interrupt you to ask a few quick questions before we move forward in this very informative answer. And the two questions are, is there anything known about the activation of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles between the ribs as it relates to nose versus mouth breathing or are they activated in the equivalent way regardless of whether or not someone is breathing through their nose or mouth? I don't think we fully have the answer to that clearly there are differences between nasal and mouth breathing. At rest, the tendency is to do nasal breathing because the air flows that are necessary for normal breathing is easily managed by passing through the nasal cavities. However, when your ventilation needs to increase like during exercise, you need to move more air. But if you do that through your mouth because the air weighs a much larger than and therefore you can move much more air. But at the level of the intercostals and the diaphragm, their contraction is not as almost agnostic to whether or not the nose and mouth are open. If I understand correctly, there's no reason to suspect that there are particular perhaps even non-overlapping sets of neurons in prebutts in your area of the brainstem that triggered nasal versus mouth inhales. No. I would say that it's not that the prebutts in complex is not concerned and cannot influence that, but it does not appear as if there's any modulation of whether or not it's where the air is coming from, whether it's coming through your nasal passages or through your mouth. Thank you. And then the other question I have is that these intercostal muscles between the ribs that move the ribs up and out. If I understand correctly and the diaphragm are those skeletal or as the brids would say skeletal muscles or smooth muscles, what type of muscle are we talking about here. As I said earlier, these are skeletal, I didn't say the skeletal muscles, but their muscles that need neural input in order to move. You talked about smooth muscles, they are specialized muscles like we have in the gut in the heart and these are muscles that are capable of actually contracting and relaxing on their own. So the heart beats, it doesn't need neural input in order to beat. The neural inputs modulate the strength of it in the frequency, but they beat on their own. The skeletal muscles involved in breathing are need neural input. Now there are smooth muscles that have an influence on breathing and these are muscles that align the the airways. And so the airways have smooth muscle and when they become activated the smooth muscle can contract or relax. And when they contract then appropriately is when you have problems breathing like an asthma. Asmers are conditioned where you get inappropriate constriction of the smooth muscles of the airways. So there's no reason to think that an asthma that the pre-buttsinger or these other neural centers in the brain that could that activate breathing that they are involved or causal for things like asthma. As of now I would say the preponderance of evidence is that it's not involved, but we've not really fully investigated that. Thank you. Sorry to break your flow, but I was terribly interested in knowing answers to those questions and you provided them. So thank you. Now remind me again where I was in my we were just landing in pre-buttsinger and we will return to the naming of pre-buttsinger because it's a wonderful and important story really. I think people should be aware of but yeah, maybe you could march us through the brain centers that you've discovered and others have worked on as well. If that control breathing pre-buttsinger as well as relating to structures. Okay. So when we discovered the pre-buttsinger we thought that it was the primary source of all rhythmic respiratory movements both inspiration and exploration. The notion of a single source is like day or night. They're all coming through all of the same origin that the earth rotates in day follows night and we thought that the pre-buttsinger complex would be inhalation exhalation. And then in a series of experiments we did in the early part of 2000 we discovered that there seemed to be another region which was dominant in producing the experiment that is the exhalation. We had made a fundamental mistake with the discovery of the pre-buttsinger not taken into account that it rest. The ex-patory muscle activity or exhalation is passive. So if that's the case, a group of neurons that might generate active exploration that is to contract the ex-patory muscles like the abdominal muscles of the internal and the castles are just silent. We just thought it wasn't there was coming from one place. But we got evidence that in fact it may have been coming from another place and following up on this experiment we discovered that there was a second oscillator. And that oscillator is involved in generating what we call active exploration. That is this active, like if I go shhh, or when you begin to exercise you have to go and actually move that air out. This group of cells which is silent that rest suddenly becomes active to dry those muscles. And it appears that it's independent oscillator. Maybe you could just clarify if I would be what an oscillator is. An oscillator is something that goes in a cycle. So you can have a pendulum as an oscillator going back and forth. The Earth is an oscillator because it goes around and it's day and night. Some people's moods are oscillating. And it depends how regular they are. You can have oscillators that are highly regular that are in a watch. It's sporadic or episodic. Breathing is when it is oscillators that for life has to be working continuously 24-7. It starts in the late in the third trimester because it has to be working when you're born. And basically works throughout life. And if it stops, if there's no intervention beyond a few minutes it will likely be fatal. What is this second oscillator called? We found that in a region around the facial nucleus. So we initially, when this region was initially identified, it we thought it was involved in sensing carbon dioxide. It was what we call essential chemo receptor. That is, we want to keep calm dioxide levels, particularly in the brain at a relatively stable level. Because the brain is extraordinarily sensitive to changes in pH. If there's a big shift in carbon dioxide to be a big shift in brain pH, and that'll throw your brain if I can use the tactical term out of whack. And so you want to regulate that. And the way to regulate something in the brain is you have a sensor in the brain. And others basically identified that the ventral surface of the brain stem. That is the part of the brain stem. And so on this side was critical for that. And then we identified a structure that we was near the trapezoid nucleus. It was not named in any of these nor anatomical lattices. So we just picked the name out of the hat. And we called it the retro trapezoid nucleus. Actually, clarify for people when we, when Jack is saying trapezoid, doesn't mean the trapezoid muscles trapezoid refers to the shape of this nucleus that is called this nucleus, this cluster of neurons. Paraphacial makes me think that this general area is involved in something related to mouth or face is, it an area rich with neurons controlling other parts of the face. Eyeblinks knows twitches, lip curls, lip smacks. If you go back in an evolutionary sense, and a lot of things that are hot to figure out begin to make sense when you look at the evolution of the nervous system. When control of facial muscles going back to more primitive creatures because they had to take things in their mouth for eating. So we call that the face sort of developed. The eyes were there, the mouth is there. These nuclei that contain the motor neurons, a lot of the control systems for them developed in the immediate vicinity. So if you think about the face, there's a lot of sudden nuclei around there that had various holes at various different times in evolution. And at one point in evolution, the facial muscles were probably very important in moving fluid in and out of the mouth and moving air in and out of the mouth. And so part of that of these many different sub-nuclear eye now seems to be in mammals to be involved in the control of expatory muscles. But we have to remember that mammals are very special when it comes to breathing because we're the only class of vertebrates that have a diaphragm. If you look at amphibians and reptiles, they don't have a diaphragm. And the way they breathe is not by actively inspiring and passively expiring. They breathe by actively expiring and passively inspiring because they don't have a powerful inspiratory muscle. And somewhere along the line, the diaphragm developed. And there are lots of theories about how it developed. I don't think it's particularly clear. There was something you can find in alligators and lizards that could have turned into a muscle that was the diaphragm. The amazing thing about the diaphragm is that it's mechanically extremely efficient. And what do I mean by that? Well, if you look at how oxygen gets from outside the body into the bloodstream, the critical passage is across the membrane in the lung. It's called the alveolar capillary membrane. The alveolar is part of the lung. And the blood runs through capillaries, which are these de-smallest tubes in the circulatory system. And as that point, oxygen can go from the airfield alveolar into the blood. Which is amazing. I find that amazing. Even though it's just purely mechanical, the idea of these little sacs and our lungs, we inhale and the air goes in and literally the oxygen can pass into the bloodstream. The air is into the bloodstream. But the rate of which it passes will depend on the characteristics of the membrane, how what the distance is between the alveolar and the blood vessel, the capillary. But the key element is the surface area. The bigger the surface area, the more oxygen that can pass through, it's entirely a passive process. There's no magic about making oxygen go in. Now, how do you get a pack of large surface area in a small chest? When you start out with one tube, which is the trachea, the trachea expands. Now you have two tubes, then you have four tubes and it keeps branching. At some point, at the end of those branches, you put a little bit of a little sphere, which is an alveolar. And that determines what the surface area is going to break. Now, you then have a mechanical problem. You have this surface area. You have to be able to pull it apart. So imagine you have a little square of a last of the membrane. It doesn't take a lot of force to pull it apart. But now if you increase it by 50 times, you need a lot more force to pull it apart. So amphibians who were breathing, not by compressing the lungs and then just passively expanding it, weren't able to generate a lot of force. So they have relatively few branches. So if you look at the surface area that they pack in their lungs, row it up to their body size, it's not very impressive. Whereas when you get to mammals, the amount of branching that you have is you have 4 to 500 million alveolar. How if we were to take those 4 to 5 million alveolar. 400 million, 400 million. 400 million. Excuse me. And lay those out flat. What sort of surface area are we talking about? About 70 square meters, which is about a third the size of a tennis court. So you have a membrane inside of you a third the size of a tennis court. So you actually have to expand every breath. And you do that without exerting much of a, you don't feel it. And that's because you have this amazing muscle, the diaphragm which because of its positioning, just by moving two thirds of an inch down is able to expand that membrane enough to move air into the lungs. Now, the, the, at rest, the value of air in your lungs is about 2.5 liters. Do we need to convert that to courts? No. All right. You have these five or six kilometers. When you take a breath, you take in another 500 millimeters or half a liter. That's the size maybe of my, of my fist. So you're increasing the volume by 20%, but you, you're doing that by pulling on this 70 square meter membrane. But that's enough to bring item, not fresh air into the lung to mix in with the air that's already there. That the oxygen levels in your, your bloodstream goes from a partial pressure of oxygen, which is 40 millimeters in mercury, to 100 millimeters in mercury. So that's a huge increase in oxygen, and that's enough to sustain normal metabolism. So we have this amazing mechanical advantage by having a diaphragm. Do you think that our brains are larger than that of other mammals in part because of the amount of oxygen that we have been able to bring into our system? I would say a key step in the ability to develop a large brain that has a continuous the main oxygen is a diaphragm. Without a diaphragm, you're an amphibi. And there's another solution to increasing oxygen, uptake, which is the way birds breathe, but birds have other limitations, and they still can't get brains as big as mammals have. So we, the brain utilizes maybe 20% of all the oxygen that we intake, and it needs to continuously, you can't, the brain doesn't want to be neglected. So this puts certain demands on breathing system, in other words, you can't shut it down for a while, which poses other issues. You're born, and you have to mature. You have the small body, you have a small long, you have a very planned rib cage, and now you have to develop into an adult, which has a stiffer rib cage. And so there are changes happening in your brain and your body, we're breathing, the neural control of breathing has to change on the fly. It's not like for things like vision, where you have the opportunity to sleep, and while you're sleeping, the brain is capable of doing things that are not easy to doing during wakefulness, like the construction crew comes in during sleep. A breathing has been, the change of breathing has been described as trying to build an airplane while it's flying. Basically what Jack is saying is that respiration science is more complex and hard-working than vision science, which is a direct jab at me. That's some of you might have missed, but I definitely do not miss, and I appreciate that you always take the opportunity like a good new yorker to give me a good health, the intellectual jab. A question related to diaphragmatic breathing, versus non-diaphermatic breathing, because the way you describe it, the diaphragm is always involved, but over the years, whether it be for yoga, class, or a breath work thing, or you hear online, that we should be breathing with our diaphragm, that rather than lifting our rib cage when we breathe, and our chest that it is healthier in air quotes, or better somehow to have the belly expand when we inhale. I'm not aware of any particular studies that really examine the direct health benefits of diaphragmatic versus non-diaphermatic breathing, but if you don't mind commenting on anything you're aware of as it relates to diaphragmatic versus non-diaphermatic breathing, whether or not people tend to be diaphragmatic breathing, or is by default, et cetera, that would be, I think, interesting to a number of people. Well, I think by default, we are obligate diaphragm breathings. I, there may be pathologies where the diaphragm is compromised, and you have to use other muscles, and that's a challenge. Certainly, I grasp other muscles can take over, but if you need to increase your ventilation, the diaphragm is very important. It's would be hot to increase your ventilation otherwise. Do you pay attention to whether or not you are breathing in a manner where your belly goes out a little bit as you inhale? Because I can do it both ways, right? I can inhale, bring my belly in, or I can inhale, push my diaphragm and belly out, not the diaphragm out, but, and that's interesting, right? Because it's a completely different muscle set for each version. Well, in the context of things like breath practice, I'm a bit agnostic about the effects of some of the different patterns of breathing. Clearly, some are gonna work through different mechanisms and we can talk about that, but at certain level, for example, whether it's primarily diaphragm or you move your abdomen or not, I am agnostic about it. I think that the changes that breathing induces in emotion and cognition, I have different ideas about what the influence is and I don't see that primarily as how which particular muscles you're choosing, but that just could be my own prejudice. Okay. And we will return to that as a general theme in a little bit. I wanna ask you about sign. One of the many great gifts that you've given also over the years is an understanding of these things that we call physiological size. Could you tell us about physiological size? What's known about them? What your particular interest in them is and what they're good for? Very interesting and important question. So everyone has a sense of what a size. We certainly, when we're emotional in some ways we're stressed, we're particularly happy, we'll take a little sigh. It turns out that we're sign all the time and when I would ask people who are not particularly knowledgeable that have read my papers or James Nessos book or listen to your podcast, they're usually off by toward a magnitude and about how frequently we sigh on the low side. In other words, they say once an hour, 10 times a day, we sigh about every five minutes. And I would encourage anyone who finds that to be an unbelievable fact, it's the lie down in a quiet room and just breathe normally, just relax, just let go and just pay attention to your breathing and you'll find that every couple of minutes, you're taking it deep breath and you can't stop it. You know, it just happens. Now why? Well, we have to go back to the lung again. The lung has these 500 million out of your life and they're very tiny. 200 microons across, so they're really, really tiny. And you can think of them as fluid filled. They're fluid lines and the reason they're fluid line has to do with the esoterica of the mechanics of that. It makes it a easier to stretch them with this fluid line which is called surfactant. And surfactant is important during development that is that determining factor in the, when premature infants of born, if they do not have lung surfactant, it makes it much more challenging to take care of them than after they have lung surfactant which is some time, if I remember correctly, in the late second, early third, try mess the witch end up peers. In any case, it's fluid line. Now think of a balloon that you would blow up. But now, before you blow it up, fill the balloon water. Squeeze all the water out and now, when you squeeze all the water out, you notice the size of the balloon stick to each other. Why is that? Well, that's because water has what's called surface tension. And when you have two surfaces of water together, they actually tend to stick to each other. Now when you try and blow that balloon up, you know that, or you'll notice if you've ever done it before, said the balloon is a little harder to inflate than if we're dry on the inside. Why is that? Because you have to overcome that surface tension. Well, you'll feel I have a tendency to collapse. There's 500 million of them. They're not collapsing at a very high rate, but it's a slow rate that's not trivial. And when it outweel as collapses, it no longer can receive oxygen or take carbon dioxide out. It's sort of taken out of the equation. Now if you have 500 million of them, and you lose 10, no big deal. But if they keep collapsing, you can lose a significant part of this surface area if you're long. Now, an normal breath is not enough to pop them open. But if you take a deep breath, it'll be a little bit through nose or mouth, okay? That's a mess. Or it's just increased that lung volume, because you're just pulling on the lungs, they'll pop open at every five minutes. And so we're doing it every five minutes in order to maintain the health of our lung. In the early days of mechanical ventilation, which was used to treat polio victims, who had weakness of their respiratory muscles, they'd be put in these big, stilt tubes. And the way they would work is that the pressure outside the body would drop. That would put a expansion pressure on the lungs, exceeding on the ribcage, the ribcage would expand. And then the lung would expand. And then the pressure would go back to normal and the lung and ribcage would go back to normal. Those were great for getting ventilation, but there was a relatively high mortality rate. It was a bit of a mystery. And one solution was to just give bigger breaths. They gave bigger breaths in a mortality rate drop. And it wasn't until I think it was the 50s, where they realized that they didn't have to increase every breath to be big, when they needed to do is every so often, they'd have one big breath. So you have a couple of minutes of normal breaths and then one big breath, just mimicking the physiological size and nanomotality rate drops significantly. And if you see someone on event of ventilator in the hospital, if you watch every couple of minutes, then you see the membrane move up and down. Every couple of minutes, they'll be a super breath. And that pops it open. So these mechanisms for these physiological size. So just like with the collapse of the lungs, where you need a big pressure to pop it open, it's the same thing with the alvella. You need a bigger pressure and a normal breath is not enough. So you have to take a big inhale. And when nature is done, instead of requiring us to remember to do it, it does it automatically. And it does it about every five minutes. And one of the questions we asked is, how is this happening? Why every five minutes? What's doing it? And we got into it to a back door. Typical of the way a lot of science gets done. This is so antipitous event where you run across a paper and something clicks and you just, you know, you follow it up. Sometimes you go down blind ends, but this time that to be incredibly productive, one of the guys in my lab was reading a paper about stress and during stress, lots of things happen in the body. One of which is that type of soundness, which is very reactive to body state, releases peptides, which are a specialized molecules, which then circulate throughout the brain and body, that particular effects usually to help deal better with the stress. And one class of the peptides that are really so called bombison-related peptides. And you also realize, because he was a breathing guy, and when you stress, you sign more. So we said, all right, maybe they've related, bombison is relatively cheap to buy. We said let's buy some bombison thrown in the brains them. Let's see what happens. And you know, one of the nice things about some experiments that we tried to design is to fail quickly. So here we had the idea, the code bombison in, and the bombison, there's nothing lost, maybe $50 to buy the bombison. But if it did something, it might be of some interest. So we only have to noon, he did the experiment. And he comes to me, says, I won't quote exactly what he said because that might need to be censored. But he said, look at this. And it was in a rat. Rats sigh about every two minutes. They're smaller than we are, and they need to sign more often. This I rate from 20 to 30 per hour to 500 per hour, when you put bombison into the prebutts in a complex. Amazing. And the way did that, is he took a very, very fine glass needle and nested the ties a rat and inserted that needle directly into the prebutts in a complex. So it wasn't internalized delivery. The peptide was localized in the prebutts, and the sire went through the roof. And I would add that that was an important experiment to deliver the bombison directly to that site because one could have concluded that the injection of the bombison increased sign because it increased stress rather than directly increased sign. Amongst hundreds of other possible interpretations, so the precision here is very important. And that goes back to what I said at the very beginning, knowing where this is happening, allows you to do the proper investigations. If you didn't know where the inspiratory rhythm was originating, we never could have done this experiment. And so then we did another experiment. We said, okay, what happens if we take the cells in the prebutts' anger that are responding to the peptide? So neurons will respond to a peptide because they have specialized receptors for that peptide, and not every neuron expresses those receptors. And the prebutts have complex probably a few hundred out of thousands. So we used the technique we had used before. And this is the technique developed by Doug Lappie down in San Diego, where you could take a peptide and conjugate it with a molecule called saprin. Saprin is a plant-derived molecule, which is a cousin to rice and many of your listeners may have heard of rice and... It's a bisonal toxin. It's very nasty. It's a single, you know, stab with an umbrella will kill you, which is something that supposedly happened to a Bulgarian diplomat by a Russian operative on a bridge in London. He got stabbed. And the way rice and works is it goes inside a cell, crosses the cell membrane, goes inside the cell, he goes to the cell, then it goes to the next cell, and then the next cell, and then the next cell. It's extremely dangerous. In fact, it's firstly impossible to work on in a lab in the United States. They won't let you touch it. Right, right. Because we've worked with saprin many times. Saprin is safe because it doesn't cross cell membranes. So you get an injection of saprin and won't do anything because it stays outside of cells. Please, nobody do that. Even though it doesn't cross cell membranes, please, nobody inject saprin, whether or not you are a operative or otherwise. Thank you, Andrew, for protecting me here. So, but what Doug Lappy figured out is that when a ligand binds to receptor, there's when a molecule binds to its receptor, in many cases, that receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside the cell. So, of course, from the membrane to cell inside the cell. So, like you can't go to the dance alone, but if you're coupled up, you get in the door. That's right. So, he figured out, as he puts saprin to the peptide, the peptide binds to its receptor, it gets internalized, and then when it's inside the cell, saprin does the same thing the rice and does. It kills the cell. But then it can't go into the next cell. So, the only cells that get killed, or the mobile item, oblated, are cells that express that receptor. So, if you have a big conglomeration of cells, you have a few thousand, and only 50 of them express that receptor, then you inject the saprin conjugated to the ligand to the peptide and only those 50 cells die. So, we took bombas and conjugated to saprin, inject and the prebutzer complex of rats. And it took about a couple of days for the saprin to actually oblate cells. And what happened is that the mice started sying less and less and less, and the rats started sying less and less and less and less and essentially stop sying. So, your student or postdoc was it murdered these cells and has a consequence that sying goes away. What was the consequence of eliminating sying on the internal state or the behavior of the rats? In other words, if one can't sy, generate physiological size, what is the consequence on state of mind? Do you imagine that carbon dioxide would build up more readily or to higher levels in the bloodstream and that the animals would be more stressed? That's the kind of logical extension of the way we set it up. It was less benign than that. When the animals got to the point where they were in sying, then we did not determine this, but the presumption was that the lung functions significantly deteriorated and they're visual at their whole health deteriorated significantly and we had to sacrifice them. So, I can't tell you whether they were stressed or not, but they're breathing got to be significantly deteriorated that we sacrificed them at that point. Now, we don't know whether that is specifically related to the fact that they'd then sying or that it's there was secondary damage due to the fact that some cells die, so we never determined that. Now, after we did this study to be candid, it wasn't a high priority for us to get this out to dorm publichip, so it stayed on the shelf. And then I got a phone call from a graduate student at Stanford, Kevin Yackel, who starts asking me all these interesting questions about breathing. And I'm happy to answer them, but at some point, it concerned me because he was working for a renowned biochemist who worked on lung and geosophila fruit flies more crass now. Yeah, I got my next door colleague. Right, yeah. And I said, why are you asking me this? And he said, I was an undergraduate, UCLA, and you gave a lecture, and my undergraduate class, and I was curious about breathing ever since. So that's one of those things which has a professor, you love to hear that actually is something you really affect in the life of a student. When you birth to competitor, but you had only yourself to blame. No, I don't look at that as a competitor. I think that there's enough interesting things to go on. I know some of our neuroscience colleagues say, you can work on my lab, but then when you leave my lab, you gotta work on something different. No one I ever trained with said that. It's open field. Do you want to work on something you hop in the mix? And there are people like that. You are scientists like that. I never felt like that. I hear that they're breathing apparatus, are disrupted, and it causes a brain dysfunction that leads to the behavior you've just described. It's actually not true. But in terms of the, before you talk about the beautiful story with Yackel and Kraz now and felt lab, I want to just make sure that I understand. So if physiological size don't happen, basically breathing overall suffers. Well, I would go back to the observations in Polio victims in these high and lungs, where the principal deficit was there was no hyperinflation in the lungs, and they many of them deteriorated and died. And just to say on this one more moment before we move to what you were about to describe, we hear often that people will overdose on drugs of various kinds because they stop breathing. So Barbituids, alcohol combined with barbituids is a common cause of death for drug users and contraindications of drugs and these kinds of things. You hear all the time about celebrities dying because they combine alcohol with barbituids. Is there any evidence that the size that occurred during sleep or during states of deep, deep relaxation and sedation that size recover the brain? Because you can imagine that if these size don't happen as a consequence of some drug impact in these brain centers that that could be one cause of basically a sphxtiation and death? If you look at the progression of an animal to death, you find that they're breathing slows down a death through the quote, natural causes. They're breathing slows down. It will stop and then they'll gasp. So we have the phrase dying gas. We super large breaths. There often describe this an attempt to order a resuscitate. That is, you take that super deep breath and that maybe it can kickstart the engine again. We do not know that the degree to such things as gasp are really size that are particularly large. And so if you suppress the ability to gasp in an individual who is a subject to an overdose, then where they might have been able to re-arouse their breathing if that's prevented, they don't get re-aroused. So that is certainly a possibility. But this has not been investigated. I mean, one of the things that interested in is individuals who have diseases which will affect prebutts in a complex. And there is data in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, which is another form of neurodegeneration where there's loss of neurons in prebutts in her. And the question is, and it also may happen in ALS, sometimes your friend who is new galaxies, in my Chhova-Glateral Scorosis. These individuals often die during sleep. We have an idea that we have not been able to get anyone to test is that patients with Parkinson's, patients with MLS typically breathe normally during wakefulness. The disturbances that they have in breathing is during sleep. So Parkinson's patients at the end stages of the disease often have significant disturbances in their sleep pattern but not during wakefulness. And we think that what could be happening is that the approximate cause of death is not heart failure, is that they become apnea, they stop breathing and don't resuscitate. And that resuscitation may or may not be due to an explicit suppression of size but to an overall suppression of the whole apparatus of the prebutts in a complex. Got it. Thank you. So Yackle calls you up. So it causes me up and is great kids super smart. And it tells me about these experiments that he's doing where he's looking at a database to try and find out what molecules are enriched in regions of the brain that are critical for breathing. So we and others have mapped out these regions in the brain stem and he was looking in one of these databases to see what's enriched. And I said, that's great. We be willing to sort of share work together. He says, no, I've my advisor doesn't want me to do that. So I said, OK. But Kevin's a great kid. And I enjoy talking to him and he's a smart guy. And what I found in academia is that the smartest people, only want to hire people smarter than them. And only want to have the preference in the rack where people smarter than them. The faculty who are not at the highest level and at every institution, they'll say distribution. They're once above the mean and those below the mean. Those who below the mean are very threatened by that. And I saw Kevin as a shining light. And I didn't care whether he was going to outcompete me because whatever he did was going to help me in the field. So I did wherever I can to work with Kevin. So at one point, I got invited to give grand rounds in the biology at Stanford. Turns out an undergraduate student who had worked with me was now head of the training program from therologist at Stanford then he invited me. And at the end of my visit, I go to Maupraus now saw office. And Kevin is there and a postdoc, Pungley, who was also working on a project was there. And the postdoc and the conversation, the mock says to me, we found this one molecule, which is highly concentrated in an important region for breathing. I said, oh, that's great. What is it? And he says, I can't tell you because we want to work on it. So I'm of course I'm disappointed. But I realized that the ethic and some areas of science or the custom and some areas of science is that until you get a publication, you be relatively strict in sharing the environment. I can't even have a chat when I came back. Well, he may remember the story differently. But I said, OK, and as I'm walking out for door, I remember these experiments I described to you about Bombison. And that was the only unusual molecule working. So the reason I'm rushing out the doors I have a flight to catch. So I stick my head in. I said, is this molecule related to Bombison? And then I run off. I don't even wait for them to reply. I get to pee up for it. Mark calls me and he says, Bombison, to peptide we found is related to Bombison. What does it do? And I said, I'm not telling. Oh, my. I'm so glad I wasn't involved in this collaboration. No, but that was sort of a tease. Because I said, well, let's work together on this. And then we worked together. Was there a person who's still Emma at that point? Yeah. So Kevin Yackel is spectacular. Has his own lab at UCSF. And the work that I'm familiar with from Kevin is worth mentioning now, or I'll ask you to mention it, which is this reciprocal relationship between brain state, where we could even say a emotional state and breathing. And I'd love to get your thoughts on how breathing interacts with other things in the brain. You've beautifully described how breathing controls the lungs, the diaphragm and the interactions between oxygen and carbon dioxide and so forth. But as we know, when we get stressed, our breathing changes when we're happy and relaxed, the breathing changes. But also, if we change our breathing, we, in some sense, can adjust our internal state. What is the relationship between brain state and breathing? And if you would, because I know you have a particular love of one particular aspect of this, what is the relationship between brain rhythms, oscillations, if you will, and breathing? This is a topic, which is really intrigued me over the past decade. I would say before that, I was in my silo, just interested about how the rhythm of breathing is generated and they really pay much attention to this other stuff. For some reason, I got interested in it. And I think it was triggered by an article in the New York Times about mindfulness. Now, believe it or not, although I lived in California for 20 years at that time, I never heard a mindfulness. It's staggering how isolated you could be from the real world. And I googled it. And there was a mindfulness institute at UCLA. And they were giving courses in meditation. So I said, oh, this is great, because I can now see whether or not the breathing part of meditation is anything to do with the purported effects of meditation. So I signed up for the course. And as I joked to you before, I had two goals. Floor was to see whether or not breathing had an effect. And the other was to levitate. Because I grew up with all these kung fu things and all the monks could levitate when they meditated. So why not? You know, we have a mile in the lab. You can't do anything interesting if you're afraid of failing. And if I fail to levitate, well, at least I try. And I should tell you, now I still haven't done it yet, but I haven't given up yet. I haven't given up. So I took this course in mindfulness. And it became apparent to me that the breathing part was actually critical. It wasn't simply a distraction or focus. They could move your index finger to the same effect. I really believed that the breathing part was involved. Now, I'm not an unbiased observer. So a question is, how can I demonstrate that? I didn't feel competent to do experiments in humans. And I didn't feel like a design that we're at experiments in humans. But I felt maybe I could study this in rodents. So we got this idea that we're going to teach rodents to meditate. And that's laughable. But we said, but if we can, then we can actually study how this happens. So believe it or not, I was able to get a sort of a start of grant, a not 21 from NCCH. That's the National Complementary Medicine Institute. A wonderful institute, I should mention. Our government puts major tax dollars toward studies of things like meditation, breath work, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. This is, I think, not well-known. And it's an incredible thing that our government does that. And I think it deserves a nod and more funding. I totally agree with you. I think that it's the kind of thing that many of us, including many scientists, things is to woo and unsubstantiated. But we're learning more and more. We used to lay off at neuroemunology that the nervous system did have anything to do with the immune system. And paying itself can influence your immune system. I mean, there are all these things that we're learning that we used to dismiss. And I think there's real nuggets to be learned here. So they went on a women they funded this particular project. And now I'm going to leap ahead because for three years, we threw stuff up against the wall that didn't work. And recently, we had a major breakthrough. We found a protocol by which we can get mice to breathe slowly, awake mice to breathe slowly. I won't tell you. Normally, they don't breathe slowly. No, no. Whatever the normal breath is, we could slow it down by a factor of 10. And they're fine doing that. So we could do that for, we did that 30 minutes a day for four weeks. Like a breath practice. Do they levitate? We haven't measured that yet. I would say, a priority. We haven't seen them floating to the top of their cage, but we haven't weighed them. Maybe they weigh less. Maybe levitation is graded. And so maybe if you weigh less, it's sort of partial levitation. In a case, we then tested them. And we had control animals mice where everything the same, except manipulation we made did not slow down their breathing. So but they went through everything else. We then put them to a standard fear conditioning, which we did with my colleague, Michael Fanzalo, who's one of the real gurus of fear. And we measured a standard test is to put mice in a condition where the concern that we see for shock and the responses that they freeze. And a measure of how fearful they are is how long they freeze. This is well validated. And it's way above my pay great. They describe the validity of the test, but it's very valid. The control mice had a freezing time which was just the same as ordinary mice would have. The ones that went through our protocol froze much, much less. According to Michael, the degree to which they were showed less freezing was as much as if there was a major manipulation in the amygdala, which is a part of the brain that's important in fear processing. It's a staggering change. How long we have now? Is the grant written out of money? The post-I've worked in the left. And now we have to train peace together everything. And but the data is spectacular. Well, I think it's a, I'll just pause you for a moment there because I think that the, you know, you're talking about a rodent study, but I think the benefits of doing rodent studies are you can get deep into mechanism. And for people that might think, well, we've known that meditation has these benefits, why do you need to get mechanistic science? I think that one thing that's important for people to remember is that first of all, as many people as one might think are meditating out there or doing breath work, a far, far, far greater number of people are not. I mean, there's a, the majority of people don't take any time to do dedicated breath work, nor meditate. So whatever can incentivize people would be wonderful. But the other thing is that it's never really been clear to me just how much meditation is required for a real effect, meaning a practical effect. People say 30 minutes a day, 20 minutes a day, once a week, twice a week, same thing with breath work. Finding minimum or effective thresholds for changing neural circuitry is what I think is the holy grail of all these practices. And that's only gonna be determined by the sorts of mechanistic studies that you describe. So I, this is wonderful. I do hope the work gets completed and we can talk about ways that we can ensure that that happens. But let me add one thing to what you're saying, Andrew. One of the issues I think for a lot of people is that there's a placebo effect that is in humans, they can respond to something, even though the mechanism has nothing to do with what the intervention is. And so it's easy to say that the meditative responses has a big component which is a placebo effect. My mice don't believe in the placebo effect. And so if we could show that's a bona fide effect and mice is convincing in ways that no matter how many human experiments you did, the control for the placebo effect is extremely difficult in humans, it mice it's a non-ish. So I think that that in of itself would be a enormous message to send. Excellent and indeed a better point. I think a 30 minute a day meditation in these mice, if I understand correctly, the meditation we don't know what they're thinking about. So it's breath practice. So they're presumably not thinking about their third eye center, low-to-sposition, levitation, whatever it is. They're not instructed as to what to do and if they were, they probably wouldn't do it anyway. So 30 minutes a day in which breathing is deliberately slowed or is slowed relative to their normal patterns of breathing. Got it. What was the frequency of sign during that 30 minutes? Unclear? Well, we have the data, we're analyzing the data. To be determined or to be announced at some point. So the fear centers are altered in some way that creates a shorter fear response to a foot shock. What are some other examples that you are aware of from work in your laboratory or work in other laboratories for that matter about interactions between breathing and brain state or emotional state? So this gets back to a prior conversation. I sort of went off on that tangent. We need to think separately of the effect of volitional changes of breathing on emotion. First is the effect of brain state on breathing. So the effect of brain state on breathing like when you stress is a fact, presumably originating in higher centers so if I can use that term affecting breathing. It's the reciprocal is that when you change breathing, it affects your emotional state. I think of those two things as different than the ultimately be tied together. So there's a landlord paper published in the 50s where they stimulated in the amygdala of cats and depending on where they stimulated, they got profound changes in breathing. There's like every pattern of breathing a possibly imagine, they found the site in the amygdala which could produce that. So this clearly a powerful descending effect coming from the amygdala which is a major site for processing emotion, fear, stress, and whatnot. That can affect breathing. And clearly we have volitional control over breathing. So we have profound effects there. Now I should say about emotional control of breathing, I need to segue into talking about locked in syndrome. Locked in syndrome is a devastating lesion that happens in a part of the brainstem where signals that controlled muscles are transmitted. So the fibers coming from your motor cortex go down to this part of the brainstem which is called eventual ponds. And if there's a stroke there, it can damage these pathways. What happens in individuals who have locked in syndrome is they lose all volitional movement, except lateral movement of the eyes and maybe the ability to blink. The reason they're able to still blink and move their eyes is that those control centers are rostrol, closer to are not interrupted. In other words, the interruption is below that. They continue to breathe because the centers for breathing don't require that volitional command. And in any case they're below that. So they're fine. So these people continue to breathe. Normal intelligence, but they can't move. There's a great book called The Diving Ball in the Butterfly about a young man who had this happens to and he describes his life. And it's a real testament to human condition that he does this. It's a remarkable book. It's a short book that he write the book by blinking. He wrote his letter. He did it by blinking to his care tanker. It's pretty amazing. And there was a movie which I've never seen with how the Ardine is the protagonist. But the book I highly recommend is anyone to read. So I colleague starting an individual at locked in syndrome. And this patient breathed very robotically. Totally consistent, very regular. They gave the patient a low oxygen mixture to breathe. Ventilation went up. I see a two mixture to breathe ventilation went up. So all the regulatory apparatus were breathing was there. They asked the patient to hold his breath or to breathe faster. Nothing happened. Just the patient recognized the command. But couldn't change it. Then all of a sudden the patient's breathing changed considerably. And they said their patient would happen. They said, you told a joke and I laughed. And they went back whenever they told a joke that the patient found funny, the patient's breathing pattern changed. And you know you're breathing pattern when you laugh is in hell. You go ha ha ha ha. But it's also very distinctive. We have some neuroscience colleagues who will go on named. Who, if you heard them laugh 50 odds away, you know exactly who they are. Yeah, well, I'll name them. Eric and L. For one has an inspiratory laugh. These famous for up as opposed to a ha ha. Exactly. Exactly. So it's very stereotype. But it's maintained in these people lose volitional control of breathing. So there's an emotive component controlling your breathing which has nothing to do with your initial control. And it goes down to a different pathway because it's not disrupted by this locked insincer. If you look at motor control of the face, we have the volitional control of the face. But we also have a motion control of the face which most of us can't control. So when we look at another person, we're able to read a lot about what their emotional state is. And that's a lot about how primates communicate. Humans communicate. And you have people who are good deceivers, probably use car salesmen, poker players. Or now poker players have tells. But many of them now wear docked glasses because a lot of the tells you blink are what not. People's eyes. People's eyes. People's eyes. People's eyes are tell. Which is an autonomic function. Not a skeletal muscle function. But we have these only skeletal muscles which we're controlling, which give us away. I have tried to get my imaging friends to emit some of the great actors that we have in Los Angeles. I mean brain images. Brain images. Yeah. I'm sorry. I mean brain images. Because I think when I tell you asked you to smile, I could tell that you're not happy, that you're smiling, because I ask you to smile. I think you're about to crack a joke. But we're old friends. So no. I'm not that, when you see a picture of it like at a birthday, I want to say, say cheese, you could tell that at least half of the people are not happy to say cheese. Whereas a great actor, when they're able to disembow and the fact that they're sad or they're happy, you believe it that they're not faking it. It's like that's great acting. And I don't think everyone could do that. I think that the individuals are able to do that have some connection to the parts of their motive control system that the rest of us don't have. Maybe they develop it through training and maybe not. But I think that this can be image. So I would like to get one of these great actors in a imageer and have them go through that and then get a normal person and see whether or not they can emulate that. And I think you're going to find big differences in the way they control the sumotiv thing. So there's a mode of control of the facial muscles. I think it's in large part similar to the mode of control of breathing. So there's that a mode of control and there's that for additional control and they're different. Now, you asked me about the Yakkel stuff. The Yakkel paper had to do with ascending that the effect of breathing on emotion. What Kevin found was that there was a population of neurons in the pre-buttsing of complex that we're always looking to things that are projecting ultimately a mode of neurons. He found the population of cells that projected to locus cereals. Mocus cereals, excuse me, is one of those places in the brain that seem to go everywhere. Take a sprinkler system, exactly. And influence, mood and you've had podcasts about this. I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on with the amoeba. So I'm sending the locus cereals. So you get into the locus cereals. You can now spray information out throughout the entire brain. He found specific cells that projected from pre-buttsinger to locus cereals. And that these cells are inspatory modulate. Now, it's been known for a long time since the six these and if you look in the locus cereals of cats when they're awake, you find many neurons that have respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention to him. Why bother? Not why bother paying attention, but why would the brain bother to have these inputs? So what Kevin did with Lindsey Schwarz and Lee-Lie-Shan loastly is they killed or bladed. Those cells going to locus cereals from pre-buttsinger. And the animals became calmer. And their EEG levels changed in ways that were indicative that they became calmer. And as I recall, they didn't just become calmer, but they weren't really capable of higher-rousal states. They were kind of flat. I don't think we really pursue that in the paper. And so we'd have to ask John Hugenon about that. But he's on the other side of my lap, so we'll ask him. But nonetheless, that beautifully illustrates how there's a bi-directional control. Well, that's a motion. Emotion, well, no, the two stories of the locked in syndrome plus the Yakle paper shows that emotional states influence breathing and breathing influences emotional states. But you mentioned inspiration, which I always call inhalation, but people will follow. No, no, that's fine. Those are interchangeable people can follow that. There's some interesting papers from nomes, sobles, group, and from a number of other groups that as we inhale, or right after we inhale, the brain is actually more alert and capable of storing information than during exhales. Which I find incredible, but it also makes sense. I'm able to see things far better when my eyes are open than when my eyelids are closed for that matter. Maybe. I don't know. No one's work is great. Let me backtrack a bit, because when people understand that when we're talking about breathing affecting emotional cognitive state, it's not simply coming from prebuttsinger. There are at least, well, there are several other sites. And let me sort of discuss, I need this sort of go to that. One is all faction. So when you're breathing, normal breathing, you're inhaling and exhaling. This is creating signals coming from the nasal mucosa that is going back into the or factory bulb, that's respiratory modulated. And the effect we both have to profound influence and projections to many parts of the brain. So there's a signal arising from this rhythmic moving of air in and out of the nose that's going into the brain that has contained in it a respiratory modulation. So that signal is there. The brain doesn't have to be using it, but when it's discriminating over and whatnot, that's riding on a oscillation, which is respiratory related. Another potential source is the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is a major nerve, which is containing affrance from all of the visceral. Affrance just being a signal signals too. A signal is from the visceral. It also has signals coming from the brains stem down, which are called eference, but it's getting major signals from the lung, from the gut. And this is going up into the brain stem. So it's there. There are very powerful receptors in the lung that are responding to the lung volume, the lung stretch. Is it a barrier or something? Sorry, we have another, like the PASO receptors of this year's Nobel Prize. Yeah. So they're responding to the expansion and relaxation in the lung. And so if you record from the vagus nerve, you'll see that there's a huge respiratory modulation due to the mechanical changes in the lung. Now, why that is of interest is that for some forms of refractory depression, a lecture stimulation of the vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief. Why this is the case still remains to be determined, but it's clear that signals in the vagus nerve, at least artificial signals in the vagus nerve, can have a positive effect on reducing depression. So it's not a leap to think that the normal circumstances that that rhythm coming in from the vagus nerve is playing a role in normal processing. Okay, let me continue. Come to oxide and oxygen levels. Now, when the normal circumstances, your oxygen levels are fine. And unless you go to altitude, they don't really change very much. But your CO2 levels can change quite a bit with even a relatively small change in your overall breathing. That's going to change in pH level. Have a colleague, Alicia Moratt, who is working with patients who are anxious. And many of them hyperventilate. And as a result of that hyperventilation, they're conducts, I love also low. And she has developed a therapeutic treatment where she trains these people to breathe slower and to restore their CO2 levels back to normal. And she gets relief in their anxiety. So CO2 levels, which are not going to affect brain function on a breath by breath level, although it does fluctuate by breath. But sort of as a continuous background, can change. And if it's changed chronically, we know that highly elevated levels of CO2 can produce panic attacks. And we don't know the degree to that. So it gets exacerbated by people who have a panic attack, who agree to which their ambience CO2 levels are affecting their degree of discomfort. What about people who are tend to be too calm, meaning they're feeling sleepy, and they're under breathing as opposed to over breathing? Is there any knowledge of what the status of CO2 is in their system? I don't know, which doesn't mean there's no knowledge, but I'm unaware. I know where, but that's blissfully unaware. I've not looked at that literature, so I don't know. I mean, most people, excuse me, most of the scientific literature around breathing in humans that I'm aware of relate to these stress states because they're a little bit easier to study in the lab. Whereas people feeling under-stimulated or exhausted all the time, it's a complicated thing to measure. I mean, you can do it, but it's not a solution. Well, CO2 is easy to measure. But in terms of the measures for feeling fatigue, there are somewhat indirect stress who we can get at pulse rates in HRV and things, that's where. Well, imagine that these devices that we're all wearing will soon be able to measure, well, not like a measure, oxygen level, and oxygen saturation, which is amazing. Yeah. But, oxygen's pretty much stay about 90% unless there's some pathology where you go to altitude. Let CO2 levels vary quite a bit. And because they vary your body as so sensitive, the control of breathing, like how much you breathe per minute, is determined in a very sensitive way by the CO2 level. So even a small change in your CO2 will have a significant effect on your ventilation. So this is another thing that not changes your ventilation, but affects your brain state. Now, another thing that could affect breathing, how breathing practice can affect your emotional state is simply the sending command, because breathing practice involves a volitional control of your breathing. And therefore, this is singlet originating somewhere in your motor cortex. That is not, of course, that's going to go down to prebuttsing her, but it's also going to send off collateral to other places. Those collateral could obviously influence your emotional state. So we have quite a few different potential sources. None of them are exclusive. There's an interesting paper which shows that if you block nasal breathing, you're still see breathing really oscillations in the brain. And this is where I think the mechanism is occurring is that these breathing-related oscillations in the brain, they are playing a role in singlet processing. And maybe as should I talk a little bit about the role that oscillations may be playing in singlet processing. Definitely, but before you do, I just want to ask you an intermediate question. We've talked a lot about inhalation, inspiration, and exhalation. What about breath holes? In apnea, for instance, people are holding their breath, whether or not it's conscious or unconscious. They're holding their breath. What's known about breath holes in terms of how it might interact with brain state or oxygen CO2? And I'm particularly interested in how breath holes with lungs empty versus breath holes with lungs full might differ in terms of their impact on the brain. I'm not aware of any studies on this, looking at a mechanistic level, but I find it really interesting. And even if there are no studies, I'd love it if you care to speculate. Well, one of the breath practices that intrigued me is where you basically hyperventilate for a minute, and then hold your breath for as long as you can. Tumos style, windmuffs style, or we call it in the laboratory, because frankly, before Tumos and before Wim, there was referred to as cyclic hyperventilation. So it's basically followed by a breath hole, and that breath hole could be done with lungs full or lungs empty. So I had a long talk with some colleagues about what they might think they're knowing mechanisms are, particularly for the breath hole. And there's certainly a, I certainly envision that there's a component with respect to the presence or absence of that rednicity in your cortex, which is having effect. But the other thing with the hyperventilation, hypoveventilation, where the apnea, is your CO2 levels are going from low to high. Anytime you're holding your breath. Anytime you're holding your breath. Okay, and those are going to have a profound influence. Now, I have to talk about episodic hypoxia. Because there's a lot of work going on, particularly with Gordon Mitchell, the University of Florida, is doing some extraordinary work on episodic hypoxia. So in the 80s, David Millhorn, did some really intriguing work. If I ask you to hold your breath, excuse me, if I gave you a low oxygen mixture, for a couple of minutes, you're breathing level would go up. Cause you wouldn't, you want to have more oxygen. You're air. No, you're still in for oxygen type, okay? And for a couple of minutes, you go up, you can be some steady state level. Not so hypoxic that you can't reach an equilibrium. And then I give you room A or again, the ventilation quickly relaxes back down to normal. If, on the other hand, I gave you three minutes of hypoxia, five minutes of normoxia, three minutes of hypoxia, five minutes of normoxia, three minutes of normoxia, five minutes of normoxia, normoxia being normal. No, no, no, volcanic. Evendulation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up. After the last episode, your breathing comes down and doesn't continue to come down, but rises again and stays up for hours. This is well validated now. This was originally done in Alice-Britain humans all the time. It seems to have profound benefit on more function and cognitive function in what direction? Positive, positive. I've often told with the idea getting a 5% an 8% oxygen, don't do this listeners. Getting an 8% oxygen tank by my desk when I'm writing a grant and doing like a blue velvet and going through the episodic hypoxia to improve my cognitive function, because certainly could use improvement when I'm writing grants. But you could do this without the low oxygen. I mean, you could do this through breath work presumably. It's hard to lower your oxygen enough. We're going in the experimental studies, they typically use 8% oxygen. It's hard to hold your breath long enough. And there is another difference here that is what's happening to your CO2 levels. When you hold your breath, your oxygen levels are dropping your CO2 levels and going up. When you're doing episodic hypoxia, your CO2 levels are going to stay pretty normal. Because you're still breathing, it's just the oxygen levels are going. So unlike normal conditions, which you described before, where oxygen is relatively constant, and CO2 is fluctuating, depending on emotional state and activity and things of that sort. In episodic hypoxia, CO2 is relatively constant, but you're varying the oxygen level coming into the system quite a bit. I would say it's relatively, I would say CO2 is relatively constant, but it's not going to go in at direction, which is going to be significantly far from normal. Whereas when you're holding your breath, you're going to become both hypoxic and hypercaptic at the same time. We should explain to people what hypoxic and hypercaptic are because we have a different type. It's just the technical term for low levels of oxygen, hyper or you could say hypoxic, low, hyper is high. So hyperoxia or hypoxia, low CO2 or hypercaptia, high levels of CO2. So when you're in episodic hypoxia, if anything, you're going to become hypocaptic, not hypercaptic, and that could have played an influence on this. One example that I remember in Gordon will have to forgive me if I'm miscoding this, is they had a patient who had a stroke and had weakness in ankle flexion. That is, it's just me ankle extension to extend the ankle. And so they had the patient in a seat where they could measure ankle extension. And then they measured it and then they exposed the patient to episodic hypoxia and they measured again the strength of the ankle extension went way up. And so Gordon is looking at this, they're looking at this now for spinal cord rehab. And I imagine for all sorts of neuromuscular performance it could be beneficial. Gordon is looking in athletic performance. We have a project which we haven't been able to push to the next level to do golf. So I like golf because you love golf. Well, it's because it's motor performance coordination. So it's not simply running as fast as you can. It's coordination, it's concentration. It's a whole variety of things. And so the idea would be to get a group of golfers and give them their placebo control. So you don't know whether they're breathing a gas mixture which is just normal air or a poxic gas mixture or that they may be able to figure it out based on their response. Do it under control circumstances that do it into a net. Measure their length of their drives, their dispersion whatnot. And see what happens. Look, if we could find that this works for golfers, forget about cognitive function. We could sell this for unbelievable amounts of money. That sounds like a terrible idea. By the way, I'm not serious about selling it, but I know you're joking. I mean, people should know that you are joking about that. No, I think that anything that can improve cognitive and neuromuscular performance is gonna be of interest for a wide range of both pathologic states, like injury, TBI, et cetera. I mean, one of the most frequent questions I get is about recovery from concussion or traumatic brain injury. A lot of people think sports, they think football, they think rugby, they think hockey. But if you look at the statistics on traumatic brain injury, most of it is construction workers, car crashes, bicycle accidents. I mean, the sports part of it is a tiny, tiny, minuscule fraction of the total amount of traumatic brain injury out there. I think these protocols tested in the context of golf would be very interesting because of the constraints of the measures, as you mentioned, and it could be exported to a number of things. I wanna just try and imagine whether or not there is any kind of breathing pattern or breath work just to be direct about it that even partially mimics what you described in terms of episodic hypoxia. I've done a lot of tumo, wim Hof, cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before my lab studies this in humans and what we find is that if people do cyclic hyperventilation, so for about a minute, then exhale, hold their breath for 15 to 60 seconds, depending on what they can do and just keep repeating that for about five minutes, it seems to me that it, at least partially mimics the state that you're talking about, because afterwards people report heightened levels of alertness, lower levels of kind of triggering due to stressful events, they feel comfortable at a higher level about an atomic oralzo cognitive focus. A number of improvements that are pretty impressive that any practitioner of wim Hof or tumo will be familiar with. Is that pattern of breathing, can we say that it maps to what you're describing in some general sense? I, well, the expert in this would be Gordon Mitchell. I would say it moves in that direction, but it's not as extreme because I don't think you can get down to the levels of hypoxia that they do clinically. I know that our pals at our breath collective actually just bored a machine, because you buy a machine that does this, I see. And they bored and they're gonna do the wrong self-test thing to see whether or not this has any effect on anything that they can measure. Of course, we have to be concerned about self-experimentation, but I applaud that curiosity and going after it. Hyperbaric chambers. Here a lot nowadays about hyperbaric chambers. People are buying them and using them. And what are your thoughts on hyperbaric chambers as it relates to any of the hyperbaric chambers? Hyperbaric chambers. You're not talking about altitude? No. I don't really have much to say. I mean, your oxygen levels will probably go up a little bit. And that could have a beneficial effect, but that's way outside my area of comfort. I think 2022, I think, is going to be the year of two things I keep hearing a lot about, which is the deliberate use of high salt intake for performance, increasing blood volume, et cetera, and hyperbaric chambers seem to be catching on much in the same way that ice baths were in, and sauna seem to be right now. But anyway, a prediction we can return to at some point. I wanna ask you about some of the studies that I've seen out there exploring how deliberately restricting ones breathing to nasal breathing can do things like improved memory. These are a couple of papers in journal neuroscience, which is a respectable journal in our field. One looking at all factory memory, so that kind of made sense because you can smell things better through your nose than your mouth, unless you're some sort of elk or something where they can presumably, they have some sense of smell in their mouth as well. But humans generally smell what they're nose. That was entirely surprising, but there was a companion study that showed that the hippocampus and area evolved in coding memories in one form or another, was more active, if you will, and memory and recall was better when people learned information while nasal breathing as opposed to mouth breathing. Does that make sense from any mechanistic perspective? Well, given that there are, there's a major pathway going from the olfactory system into the brain, and you cut that, and not one from many receptors in the mouth, the degree of respiratory modulation you're going to see throughout the forebrain is going to be less with mouth breathing and nose breathing. So it's certainly plausible. I think there are a lot of experiments that need to be done to distinguish between the two that is the nasal component and the non-naisial component of these breathing-related signals. There's a tendency sometimes when you have a strong effect to be exclusive. And I think what's going on here is that there are many inputs that can have an effect. Now, whether they're possible that some effect, this part of behavior and some effect, that part of behavior remains to be investigated. There's certainly a strong olfactory component. My interest is trying to follow the central component because we know that there's a strong central component in this. In fact, there's a strong central projection to the olfactory ball. So regardless of whether or not there's any of the nose, there's a respiratory input into the olfactory ball, which combines with the respiratory-modulated signals coming from the sensory receptors. Interesting. And as long as we are poking around, forgive it upon the nose, what about one nostril versus the other nostril? I know it sounds a little crazy to imagine, but there have been theories in yoga traditions and others that breathing through one nostril, somehow activates certain brain centers, maybe hemispherically, one side of the brain versus the other, or that right nostril and left nostril breathing might differ in terms of the levels of alertness or calmness they produce. I'm not aware of any mechanistic data on that, but there's anything worthwhile of right nostril versus left nostril breathing that you're aware of, I'd love to know. Well, it's certainly plausible. I don't know of any data demonstrating it except the anecdotal reports. As you know, the brain is highly lateralized, and we have speech on one side and a dominant hand this on one side. And so the notion that if you have the huge signal coming from the olfactory system, and the sun degree is lateralized is not perfectly symmetrical. That is, one side is not going evenly to both sides. Then you can imagine, and once the signal gets distributed in a way that's not uniform, that the effectiveness or the response is going to be particular to the cortex in which either the signal still remains or the signal is removed from, I see. What are some of the other features of our brain and body be it blinking or eye movements or ability to encode sounds or any features of the way that we function and move and perceive things that are coordinated with breathing in some interesting way? Thank you for that question. Almost everything. So we have, for example, on the autonomic side, we have respiratory sinus in rhythmia that is during expiration, the heart slows down. You're pupil is oscillate with the respiratory cycle. I don't know what the functional basis for that is, but they do oscillate with the respiratory cycle. When we inhale our pupils constrict presumably because there's an increase in heart rate in sympathetic tone, I would think of constriction. And I'm guessing as you relax, the people will get then you exhale the people. You would take your right, but I always get the valence. Well, it's counterintuitive because people want to think that when the pupils get, it depends. I mean, you can get very alert and arousin for stress or for good reasons and the pupils get wider by your visual field narrows and then the opposite is true. Anyway, I guess the ideas that the pupils are changing size and therefore the aperture your visual window is changing in coordination with breathing. Your fear response changes with the respiratory cycle. Tell us more about that. So paper by Zalano, which I think showed rather clearly that if you show individuals fearful faces that their measured response of fearfulness changes between inspiration and expression. You don't know why, but it does. Your reaction time changes. So you talk about blinking. The reaction time changes between inspiration and expression. If I ask you to punch something that time will change between inspiration and expression. In fact, I don't know the degree to which martial artists exploit that. You know, you watch the breathing pattern your opponent will actually move slower during one cycle compared to the other. Meaning as they're in which direction. If they're exhaling, they can punch faster. I have to say I don't keep a table of which is which direction things move in because I'm out of the martial arts field. My vague understanding is that exhales on strikes is the more typical way to do that. And so as people strike, they exhale. In one as you exhale, but there are other components to strike and because you want to stiffen your ribcage, you want to make a Valsalva manoeuvra. So that's both an inspiration and an inspiration that's at the same time. So I don't know enough about when you say during expiration, I would assume that when you make your strike, you actually sort of want to stiffen here, which is Valsalva and like maneuver. And oftentimes they'll clinch their fest at the last moment. Anyway, there's a whole set of motor things that we should we can talk to some fighters. We know people who know fighters. So what we can ask them interesting, what are some other things that are modulated by breathing? You know, I think anything anyone looks at seems to have a breathing component because it's all over your brain. And it's hard to imagine, it's not being effective. Now whether it's incidental or just background and doesn't really have any behavioral advantage, is possible. In other cases, it might have a behavioral advantage. I mean, the big this, I open anything for me probably a decade ago, was digging into literature and seeing how much of core activity and sub-core activity had a respiratory and much later component to it. And I think a lot of my colleagues who was studying cortex are oblivious to this. And they find, I heard it talk the other day for personal gone name, who find a lot of things correlated with a particular movement. And I think it all, when I looked, I said, gee, that's the list of things that are respiratory modulated. And rather than it being correlated to the movement that we're looking at, I think the movement they were looking at was modulated by breathing as was everything else. So there wasn't that the movement itself was driving that correlation. It was that they were all correlated to something else, which was the breathing movement. And whether or not that is a behaviorally relevant or behaviorally something can exploit, I don't know. I suspect you, right, that breathing is, if not the foundational driver of many, if not all of these things, that it's at least one of the foundation. It's in the background. It's in the brain. Asylations play an important part in brain function. And a very infrequency from maybe 100 hertz down to what we can get to circadian and, you know, sort of monthly cycles. But breathing occupies a rather unusual place in all that, because, so let me talk about what the people think the oscillations are doing, particularly the faster ones. They're important in coordinating signals across neurons, just like in a computer, a computer steps. So a computer knows when information is coming from another part of a computer that it was originated at a particular time. And so that the screen step by step thing is important in computer control. Now the brain is not a digital device. It's an analog device. But when I have a signal that coming in my ear and my eye, which is angel human speaking, and I'm looking at his face, I see that as a whole, but the signal is coming into different parts of my brain. How do I unify that? Well, my neurons are very sensitive to changes in signals arriving by fractions of a millisecond. So how do I ensure that those signals coming in represent the same signal? Well, if I have to write my brain in oscillation, and the signals write on that oscillation, let's say, the peak of the oscillation, I can then have a much better handle on the road of timing and say, those two signals came in at the same time. They may relate to the same object. And aha, I see you as when unified thing spouting talking. And so these oscillations come in many different frequency ranges and are important in memory formation and all sorts of things. I don't think people paid much attention to breathing, because it's relatively slow to this, the range when you think about milliseconds. But we have important things that I thought to be important in cognitive function, which are a few cycles per second to 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing in humans is maybe 0.2 cycles per second, every five seconds. Although in runs, they're up to four per second, which is pretty fast. So breathing has one thing which is special that is you can readily change it. So the degree to which the brain is using that slow signal for anything, if that becomes part of its normal signal processing, you now change it. That signal processing has to change. And as that signal processing changes, acutely, there's a change. So you asked about breath practice, how long do you have to do it? Well, a signal breath will change your state. Your nervous, you take a deep breath. And it seems to help relax or resign. Call it what you will. Call it what you will. It seems to work. Now, it doesn't have a permanent change, but when I'm getting up to bat or getting up to the first T or getting to give a big clock or coming to do a podcast, get a little bit anxious, a deep breath or a few deep breaths, a tremendously effective in calming when down. And so you can get a transient disruption. But on the other hand, let's take something like depression. I think that you can envision depression as activities sort of going around in a circuit. And because it's continuous in the nervous system, as signals keep repeating, they tend to get stronger. And then you get so strong, you can't break them. So you can imagine the pressure being something going on and on and on and you can't break it. And so we have trouble when we get to certain levels of depression. And we all of us get depressed at some point. But if it's not continuous, it's not one last thing we're able to break it. But if it's long lasting and very deep, we can't break it. So the question is, how do we break it? Well, there are extreme measures to break it. We could do electro-convulsive shock. We shock the whole brain. That's disrupting activity in the whole brain. And when the circuit starts to get back together again, it's been disruptive. And we know that the brain, when signals get disrupted a little bit, we can weaken the connections. And weakening the connections of its head and the circuit evolved in depression, we may get some relief. An electro-convulsive shock does work for relieving many kinds of depression. That's pretty heroic. Focal de-brain stimulation does the same thing, but more localized or trans-cranial stimulation. You disrupting an network. And while it's getting back together, it may weaken some of the connections. If breathing is playing some role in this circuit, and now, instead of doing like a one-second shock, I do 30 minutes of disruption by doing slow breathing, are the breathing practice? They don't circuits begin to break down a little bit. And I get some relief. And if I continue to do it before the circuit and then build back up again, I gradually convey that circuit down. I sort of liken this. I tell people it's like walking around on a dirt path. You build a rot to rot, get so deep. You can't get out of it. And what breathing is doing is sort of filling in the rut bit by bit to the point that you can climb out of that rut. And that is because breathing, the breathing signal, is playing some role in the way the circuit works. And then when you disrupt it, the circuit gets a little thrown off kilter. And as you know, when circuits get thrown off, the nervous system tries to adjust in some way or another. And it turns out that at least for breathing for some evolutionary reason or just by happens the answer, it seems to improve our emotional function or our cognitive function. And we're very fortunate that that's the case. It's a terrific segue into what I want to ask you next. And this is part of a set of questions. I want to make sure we touch on before we wrap up, which is what do you do with all this knowledge in terms of a breathing practice? You mentioned that one breath can shift your brain state and that itself can be powerful. I think that's absolutely true. You've also talked about 30 minute breath practice, which is 30 minutes of breath work is a pretty serious commitment. I think, but it's doable. Certainly a zero cost except for the time, for in most cases. What do you see out there in the landscape of breath work that's being done that you like? And why do you like it? What do you think, or what would you like to see more of in terms of exploration of breath work? And what do you do? Well, I'm a well-a-living new convert to breath work through my own investigation of it that became convinced that it's real. And I basically a beginner in terms of my own practice. And I like to keep things simple. And I think I've discussed this before. I liken it to someone as a couch potato who told they got to begin to exercise. You don't go out and run a marathon. So couch potatoes, you say, OK, get up and walk for five minutes and 10 minutes. And then, OK, now you're walking for a longer period. You begin to run. And then, you reach your point and say, well, gee, I'm interested in this sport. And there may be particular kinds of practices that you can use that could be helpful in optimizing performance at that sport. I'm not there yet. I find I get tremendous benefit by relatively short periods between five and maybe 20 minutes of doing box breathing. It's very simple to do. I have a simple app, which helps me keep the timing. Do you recall what you have? Is it the app near trainer? Is that the one I was using calmed for a long time? But I let my subscription relapse. And I have another one who's named, I don't remember. But it's so it's very simple. And it works for me now trying this too low, because I'm just curious and exploring it because it may be acting for a different way. And I want to see if I respond differently. So I don't have a particular point of view. Now I have friends and colleagues who are into particular styles like Wim Hof. And I think what he's doing is great and getting people who are interested. I think the notion is that I would like to see more people exploring this. And to some degree, as you point out, 30 minutes a day, some of the breath patterns that some of these styles like Wim Hof are a little intimidating to new bees. And so I would like to see something very simple that people, what I tell my friends is, let's just try it. 5-10 minutes. If you feel better, do for a few days. If you don't like it, stop it. It doesn't cost anything. And invariably, they find it's helpful. I will often interrupt my day to take 5-10 minutes. Like if I find that I'm way again, I think there's some pretty good data that you are performance after lunch declines. And so very often what I'll do after lunch, which I then do today, is take 5-10 minutes and just sort of breath practice. And lately, what does that breath practice look like? It's just box breathing for 5-10 minutes. And the duration of your inhales and holes and exhales and holes is set by the app. Well, I do 5 seconds. So 5 seconds, inhale, 5 second hole, 5 second exhale, 5 second. And sometimes I'll do doubles. I'll do 10 seconds. Just because I get bored. You know, I feel like doing it. And it's very helpful. That's not the only thing I do with respect to trying to maintain my sanity and my health. So I can imagine that we have a number of things. And I'll let you seem, because you've seen very sane and very healthy, I, in fact, know that you are both those things. Well, you're suspected. I suspect. But there's data. A while back, we had a conversation, casual conversation, but you said something that really stuck in my mind, which is that it might be that the specific pattern of breath work that one does is not as important as experiencing transitions between states based on deliberate breath work, or something to that extent, which I interpreted to mean that if I were to do box breathing with 5 second in, 5 second hole, 5 second exhale, 5 second hole for a couple of days, or maybe even a couple of minutes, and then switch to 10 seconds, or then switch to tumo, that there's something powerful, perhaps, in the transitions and realizing the relationship between different patterns of breathing in those transitions. Much in the same way that you can get onto into one of these cars and amusement park that just goes at a constant rate, and then stops, very different than learning how to shift gears, you know, you should travel manual. I still can't, so I'll think about a manual transmission, but even within automatic transmission, you start to get a sense of how the vehicle behaves under different conditions. And I thought that was a beautiful seed for a potential breath work practice that at least to my awareness, nobody has really formalized, which is that you introduce some variability within the practice that somewhat random, in order to be able to sense the relationship between different speeds and depths of inhales, exhales, and holes, and so forth. And essentially, it's like driving around the track, but with obstacles at different rates and breaking and restarting and things like that, sort, that's how you learn how to drive. What do you think about that? And if you like it enough, can we call it the Feldman protocol? No, please. You know, I was asked in this BBC interview once, why did an I name it, the Feldman complex, so the prebutts who are accomplishing? We did our A, have a Feldman complex. Well, it sounds like a psychiatric disorder, but, I think the primary effect is disruptive effect, which I described, but the particular responses may clearly vary depending on what that disruption is. I don't know of any particular data, which are some well controlled experiments, which can actually work through the different types of breathing patterns, or simply with a box pattern, just varying the durations. I mean, proyama is sort of similar, but the amount of time you spend going around the boxes different. So I don't really have much to say about this. I mean, this is why we need better controlled experiments in humans. And I think this is where being able to study it in rodents, where you can have a wide range of perturbations, while you're doing more invasive studies, to really get down as to which regions are affected, how is the signal processing disrupted, which is still hypothesis, but how is disrupted? It could tell us a lot about maybe there's a resonant point at which there's an optimal effect when you take a particular breathing practice. And then when we talked about the fact that different breathing practices could be affecting the outcomes to different pathways. The olfactory pathway, you have a central pathway, you have a vagal pathway, you have a descending pathway, how different practices may change the summation of those things, because I think all those things are probably involved. And we're just beginning to scratch the surface. And I just hope that we can get serious, or a scientist, the psychologist, to do the right experiments, to get it this, because I think there's a lot of value to human health here. I do too, and it's one of the reasons my lab is shifted to these sorts of things. In humans, I'm delighted that you're continuing to do the hardcore mechanistic work in mice and probably do work in humans all as well, if you're not already. And there are other groups, Apple Lab at UCSF, and a number of, I'm starting to see some papers out there about respiration in humans a little bit, some more brain imaging. I can't help but ask about a somewhat unrelated topic, but it is important in light of this conversation, because you're here. And one of the things that I really enjoy about conversations with you as it relates to health and neuroscience, and so forth is that, you're one of the few colleagues I have who openly admits to exploring supplementation. I'm a long time supplement fan. I think there's power in compounds, both prescription, non-prescription, natural, synthesized. I don't use these half-hazardly, but I think there are certainly power in them. And one of the places where you and I converge is in terms of our interest in the nervous system and supplementation is of a magnesium. Now, I've talked at endlessly on the podcast in elsewhere about magnesium for sake of sleep and improving transitions to sleep and so forth. But you have somewhat different interest in magnesium as it relates to cognitive function and durability of cognitive function. Would you mind just sharing with us a little bit about what that interest is, where it stems from. And because it's the human lab podcast and we often talk about supplementation, what you do with that information. So I need to disclose, that I am a scientific advisor to a company called Norse Sancho, which by graduate student, Koso and Louis CEO. So that said, I can give you some background. Koso, although when he was in my lab worked on breathing, had a deep interest in learning and memory. And we left my lab, he went to work for it, was a renowned learning and memory guy at Stanford Diction. And when he finished their research hired by Susuma Tonegawa and MIT. Well, also knows the thing or two about memory. I'm teasing Susuma has no bell for his work on immunoglobulins, but then is a world-class memory researcher. Yeah. And more. He's many things. And Gosung had very curious, very bright guy. And he was interested in how signals between neurons get strengthened, which is called long-term potential in LTP. And one of the questions that arose was, if I have inputs to a neuron and I get LTP, is the LTP bigger if the signal is bigger or the noise is less. So we can imagine that when we're listening to something of a slatter, we can hear it better, or if this less noise, we can hear it better. And he wanted to investigate this. So I did this in tissue culture of hippocampal neurons. And what he found was that if he lowered the background activity in all of the neurons, that the LTP, he elicited, got stronger. And the way he did that, was increasing the level of magnesium in the bathing solution. He gets into some esoteric electrophysiology. But basically, there's a background level of noise and onerons. And that part of it is regulated by the degree of magnesium in the exosarial abat. And you mean electrical noise? Electrical noise. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And if you in what's called the physiological range, which is between 0.8 and 1.2 million molar, which don't worry about the nuclear. Remember the million molar of the magnesium? Well, I'm always frightened that I say micro or fental or something. I go off by several or some magnitude. But so in that physiological range, there's a big difference in the amount of noise in the neuron between 0.8 and 1.2 million molar. So he played around with the magnesium. And he found out that when the magnesium was elevated, there was more LTP. All right, that's an observation in an additional culture. And I should just mention that more LTP essentially translates to more neuroplasticity, more rewiring of connections in essence. So he tested this in mice. And basically offered them a... He had control mice, which got a normal diet and one that had one that reached the magnesium. And the ones that lived in rich with magnesium had high-accognitive function, live longer, everything you'd want in some magic pill, those mice did that, extremely rats. The problem was that you couldn't imagine taking this into humans because most magnesium salts don't passively get from the gut into the bloodstream into the brain. They pass via what's called a transporter. Transporter is something in a membrane that grabs a magnesium molecule or atom. And pulls it into the other side. So if you imagine you have magnesium in your gut, you have transporters that pull the magnesium into the bloodstream. Well, if you had taken normal magnesium supplement that you can buy at the pharmacy, it doesn't cross the gut very easily. And if you would take enough of it to get it in your bloodstream, you start getting diarrhea. So it's not a good way to go. Oh, it is a good way to go. So I couldn't help myself. Well, I'll say. So he worked with this brilliant chemist, Feyn mal. And Feyn looked at a whole range of magnesium in compounds. And he found that magnesium 3 and 8 was much more effective in crossing the gut blood barrier. Now they didn't realize at the time, but 3 and 8 is a metabolite of vitamin C. And there's lots of 3 and 8 in your body. So magnesium 3 and 8 would appear to be safe. And maybe part of the role or now they believe it's part the role of the 3 and 8 is that it supercharges the transporter to get to the magnesium. And remember, you need a transporter at the gut into the brain and into cells. So they gave magnesium 3 and 8 to mice who had, no, let me backtrack a bit. They did his study in humans. They hired a company to do a test. There was a hands-off test. It's one of these companies that got hired by the big farmer to do their tests for them. And they got patients who had, what diagnosis is mild cognitive decline. These are people who had cognitive disorder, which was age and appropriate. And the metric that they use for determining how far off they were is Spirman's G-Factor, which is a generalized measure of intelligence that most psychologists accept. And the biological age of the subjects was, I think, 51, and the cognitive age was 61 based on the Spirman G-Factor. I should say the Spirman G-Factor starts at a particular level in the population at age 20 and declines about 1% a year. So sorry to say we're not 20 year olds anymore. But when you get a number from that, you can put on the curve and see whether it's about your age or not. These people were about 10 years older according to that metric. And long story short, if the three months, this is a placebo controlled double blind study, the people who were in the placebo arm improved two years, which is common for human studies because of placebo effect. The people who got the compound improved eight years on average. And some improved more than eight years. They didn't do any further diagnosis as to what caused the molecule in the clinic. But it was pretty. It was extraordinarily impressive. So it moved their cognition closer to their biological age. Biological age. Do you call what the doses of magnesium three in it? It's in the paper. And it's basically what they have in the compound, which is sold commercially. So the compound, which is sold commercially, is handled by a neutral, suitable wholesaler who sells it to the retailers. And they make whatever formulation they want. But it's a dosage, which is, minus than is rarely tolerable, I take half of those. The reason I take half of those is that I had my magnesium measured. And it was low normal for my age. I took half of those so became high normal. And I felt comfortable staying in the normal range. But a lot of people were taking the full dose. And at my age, I'm not looking to get smarter. I'm looking to decline more slowly. And it's hard as hard for me to tell you whether or not it's effective or not. Well, you remember the millimolar of the magnesium and the solution and the high and low end. So I would say it's not a well-controlled study when it's an animal run. But it seems to be working. When I recommend it to my friends, academics who are not by nature skeptical, if not cynical. And it insists that they try it. They usually don't report a major change in their cognitive function, or those sometimes they do report while I feel a little bit more alert. And I knew my physical movements are better. But many of them report they sleep better. And that makes sense. I think there's good evidence that three-and-a-eight can accelerate the transition into sleep, and maybe even access to deeper modes of sleep. For many people, actually, a small percentage of people who take three-and-a, including one of our podcast staff here have stomach issues with it. They can't tolerate it. I would say just anecdotally, about 5% of people don't tolerate three-and-a-eight. Well, stop taking it and then they're fine. It causes them diarrhea or something like that sort. But most people tolerate it well. And most people report that it vastly improves their sleep. And again, that's anecdotally. There are a few studies, and they're more on the way. But that's very interesting because I, until you and I had the discussion about three-and-a-eight, I wasn't aware of the cognitive enhancing effects. But the story makes sense from a mechanistic perspective. And it brings it around to a bigger and more important statement, which is that I so appreciate your attention to mechanism. I guess this stems from your early training as a physicist and the desire to get numbers and to really parse things at a fine level. So we've covered a lot today. I know there's much more that we could cover. I'm going to insist on a part two at some point. But I really want to speak on behalf of a huge number of people and just thank you, not just for your time and energy and attention to detail and accuracy and clarity around this topic today. But also what I should have said at the beginning, which is that you really are a pioneer in this field of studying respiration and the mechanisms underlying respiration with modern tools for many decades. And the field of neuroscience was one that was perfectly content to address issues like memory, and vision, and sensation perception, et cetera. But the respiratory system was largely overlooked for a long time. And you've just been steadily clipping away and clipping away in much because of the events of related to COVID and a number of other things. And this huge interest in breath work and brain states and wellness, the field of respiration and interest in respiration is just exploded. So I really want to extend a sincere thanks. It means a lot to me and I know to the audience of this podcast that someone with your depth and rigor in this area is both a scientist and a practitioner and that you would share this with us. So thank you. Well, I want to thank it. This is actually a great opportunity for me. I've been isolated my silo for a long time. And it's been a wonderful experience to communicate to people outside the silo have an interest in this. And I think that there's a lot that remains to be done. And I enjoy speaking to people who have interest in this. I find the interest to be quite mind-boggling. And it's quite wonderful that people are willing to listen to things that can be quite esoteric at times. But it gets down to deep things about who we are and how we are going to live our lives. So I appreciate the opportunity. And I would be delighted to come back at any time. Wonderful. We will absolutely do it. Thanks again, Jack. Bye now.

During today's podcast and on many previous podcast episodes, we talk about supplements, while supplements aren't necessary for everybody. Many people derive tremendous benefit from them. One of the key issues with supplements if you're going to take them is that they be of the utmost quality. For that reason, the Huberman Lab podcast has partnered with Thornthe, O-R-N-E. Thornthe supplements are of the very highest quality, both with respect to the quality of the ingredients themselves and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients. Why do I say that? Well, many supplements companies out there list amounts of particular substances on the bottle. And when they've been tested, they do not match up to what's actually in those products. Thornthe has the highest levels of stringency for quality and the particular amounts that are in each product. They partnered with Mmeo Clinic and all the major sports teams, so there's tremendous trust in Thornthe products. That's why we partnered with them. If you're interested in seeing the supplements that I take, you can go to Thornthe.com slash the letter U slash Huberman. You can see the supplements that I take from Thornthe. If you purchase any of those supplements there, you can get 20% off. And if you navigate further into the Thornthe site to see the huge array of other products that they make, if you go in through Thornthe.com slash U slash Huberman, you'll also get 20% off any of the products that Thornthe makes. I also want to just mention one more time. The program that I mentioned at the beginning of the episode, which is our breath collective, the our breath collective, has an advisory board that includes people like Dr. Jack Feldman, where you can learn detailed breath work protocols.

So I want to thank you once again for joining me for my conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman. And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science."
vid00015," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and off-the-mology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Duncan French as my guest on the Huberman Lab podcast. Dr. French is the vice president of performance at the UFC Performance Institute, and he has over 20 years of experience working with elite professional and Olympic athletes. Prior to joining the UFC French was the director of performance science at the University of Notre Dame. And he has many, many quality peer-reviewed studies to his name, exploring, for instance, how the particular order of exercise, whether or not one performs endurance exercise, prior to resistance training or vice versa, how that impacts performance of various movements and endurance training protocols, as well as the impact on hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and some of the stress hormones such as cortisol. He's also done fascinating work, exploring how neurotransmitters, things like dopamine and epinephrine, also called adrenaline, can impact hormones and how hormones can impact neurotransmitter release. What's particularly unique about Dr. French's work is that he's figured out specific training protocols that can maximize, for instance, to stostorone output or reduce stress hormone output in order to maximize the effects of training in the short term and in the long term. So today you're going to learn a lot of protocols, whether or not you're into resistance training or endurance training, you will learn, for instance, how to regulate the duration of your training and the type of training that you do in order to get the maximum benefit from that training over time. So whether or not you are somebody who just exercises recreationally for your health, whether or not you're an amateur or professional athlete, or whether or not you're just trying to maximize your health through the use of endurance and or resistance training. Today's discussion will have a wealth of takeaways for you. There are only a handful of people working at the intersection of elite performance, mechanistic science, and that can do so in a way that leads to direct immediately applicable protocols that anybody can benefit from. Dr. French also provides some incredibly important insights about the direction that sport and exercise are taking in the world today and their applications towards performance and health. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Roka. Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. I've spent my career working on the visual system and I can tell you that everything about the way that Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed was with performance in mind. First of all, they're extremely lightweight. You actually forget that you're wearing the most of the time. Second of all, even if you get sweaty, if you're running or biking or it's a hot day or running around just having to be perspiring quite a lot, they don't slip off your face, which is terrific. They also have a great aesthetic and they have a lot of different styles to choose from. The clarity of the lenses is superb. I don't think there's a match for the clarity of Roka glasses out there. It is, I'm not aware of it. They are absolutely crystal clear and that's true in any environment, whether or not you're working in a dim environment or a bright environment. The clarity is unmatched. If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses, you can go to Roka.com. That's ROKA.com and enter the code. Heuremon to save 20% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are uniquely tailored to your sleep needs. All of us have unique sleep needs and we should be sleeping on a mattress that's ideal for us. If you go to the Helix site, they have a quick two minute quiz. Ask you a number of questions about whether or not you sleep on your side, your back or stomach, do you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera. Maybe you don't have the answers to those questions, which is fine. They'll match you to the mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs. I took that quiz and about 10 months ago I started sleeping on the dusk Helix mattress that's DUSK. That's the mattress that's ideal for me and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to HelixSleep.com-Huberman. Take their two minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress and you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders and two free pillows. That's Helix Sleep.com-slash-Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that's backed by 25 published studies. By now I think most people have heard about or experienced the benefits of meditation. Improve focus, better sleep, reduce stress, more creativity and insight. There's just so many studies out there that support those claims. The challenge, however, is sticking to a meditation practice. And over the years, I confess there have been times when I've meditated regularly and then I stop meditating. Even though it always provides benefits for me the first time I do it and every time I do it. With the headspace app, it makes it very easy to meditate consistently because they have different types of meditations to select from and they come in different duration. So sometimes I only have three or four minutes to meditate. They have those sorts of meditations. They also have longer meditations of 20 minutes or more. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com-slash-special offer. And if you do that, you'll get a free one-month trial with Headspace's full library of meditations that you can use in any situation. This is the best deal offered by Headspace right now. So again, if you're interested, go to headspace.com-slash-special offer. And now my conversation with Dr. Duncan French. Duncan French. Great to see you again. Likewise. Likewise. Thank you. I don't often have many Stanford professors in the performance institute. So I'm really excited to do that. So this place is amazing. And you have a huge role in making it what it is. The reason I'm so excited to talk with you is that you're one of these rare beasts that you have been involved in human performance and athletic performance at the collegiate level. You are obviously very involved in MMA now in the UFC Performance Institute. And you also had the fortunate experience I like to think of doing a PhD in what exactly was the PhD in? It's exercise physics, I suppose. So your familiar also with designing studies, control groups, all the sorts of things that, in my opinion, in any way are kind of lacking from the internet, social media version of exercise science, which is that people throughout all sorts of ideas about how people should be training, what they should be doing, eating and not eating and doing. And certainly science doesn't have all the answers, but I just think it's so rare to find somebody that's at the convergence of all those different fields. And so I have a lot of questions for you today that I'm sure the audience are going to be really interested in it. Well listen, I appreciate that. It's very humbling and yeah, I've worked hard to get to where I am. But I've always tried to be authentic. And I think authenticity comes alongside an academic rigor and objectivity and insight and knowledge base, right? At the end of the day, it's about having confidence, having expertise and being able to deliver that expertise to in my world to athletes. And I think that's what I've always tried to do. I've tried to have many strings to my bow. So that I can talk with many different hats on. You know, one day I'm talking to a coach, next time talking to an athlete, the next day I'm talking to a CEO, the next time talking to an academic professor. And so I think being able to wear those different hats is certainly a skill set that I've tried to build throughout my career. And I've been blessed to work with, I think it was 36 different professional Olympic sports last time of course. So yeah, it's been a wild ride, it's been great. Which of those sports was the most unusual? I've worked with crown green bowling, which I don't know is an American guy. I don't know. I don't know that part of it. Basically imagine a, you know, a 24 by 24 square of turf with a small raise in the middle. I eat the crown. So it's it slopes to the edges. And then, you know, you use you throw out a white jacket, a smaller ball and then you smother that roll out larger balls to try and get closest to the jacket. It's a very European thing. That's it. But yes, sports performance, a crown green ball and there you go. All right. Wow. And then to mix martial arts, absolutely. And everything in between. So along those lines, could you give us a little bit of your background? Where do you start out? Where are you from originally? Yeah, from the north east of England. I'm from a town called Hariget, which is in Yorkshire, which is an old and kind of area of the United States. Yeah, they're all you're along. Yeah. You can imagine. Yeah. The two weeks of some of that we get, you know. But yeah, I mean, I did my undergraduate studies there in sports science. I did teacher training to be a physical education teacher after that. Like most people, then, you know, works as a high school physical education teacher. You know, great experience working with kids, you know, developing, you know, athletic qualities. But something in the back of my mind, always, you know, I wanted more. I wanted to be, you know, to be at the higher end of a elite sport. You know, I was a failed athlete like many people. I've represented my country in different sports and things, but I never made it professionally. So, you know, that little seed was so, and in as much as I then, it started to reach out to, you know, to different areas to do a PhD, whether it was in the UK or also, you know, chance my arm took a punt, see if we could get over to the States. You know, all my buddies were going on, you know, gap years after the finish university, whatever, and going to Bali and hanging out or whatever, traveling through Thailand, and I figured, well, you know, I've always loved the States and kind of go on kill two birds. We want stone and do something academic, continue my studies, and but also doing a different environment and get some life experience and then many, many rejections. As I'm sure you're kind of aware from different professors, whether it's Roger or no occur or, you know, William Crayon, you just wrote to these folks. I just called, called, called and sent out information and saying, yeah, so, if you got any opportunities, push back from them all, but, you know, dog aid and kept, kept asking and, yeah, Dr. William Crayon, who was at Ball State University in Indiana at the time, you know, a muscle, neuroendocrinologist and researcher in muscle physiology using resistance training. You know, he basically said, listen, I can guarantee you funding for the first year of your studies, but not the next three. Sounds like a typical academic response. I can take care of you, but not that well necessarily. Yes, so, spoke to my parents and said, hey, can we take a pun and that, you know, they were great in supporting me and yeah, long story short came out to, to begin my PhD at Ball State after a year, Dr. Crayon, transferred to Yukon, you know, Connecticut and Stores in the Northeastern, transferred to him and with him and, yeah, four great years with my, with my PhD and getting my PhD with, with a really prolific research group that looked at, you know, neuroendocrinology, hormonal work, but using a resistance training primarily as an exercise stressor as a major mechanism and then looking at all the different physiologies off the back of resistance training. Yeah, you guys were enormously productive. I found dozens of papers on how weight training impacts hormones and your names on all of them and it's remarkable. I have a question about this. I'll just inject a question about weight training in hormones. You hear this all the time that doing these big heavy compound movements or resistance training increases androgens, things like testosterone, DHD, DHA and so forth. Does anyone know how that actually happens? Like, what about, what about, and what is it about engaging motor neurons under heavy loads, sends a signal to the endocrine system, hey, release testosterone. I've never actually been able to find that in a textbook. Yeah, well, I mean, and how can I do more of that? As much as I know, and again, I'm big enough into the animals of Duncan Brench, he's kind of brain now, but yeah, I mean, it's a stress response, right? It's mechanical stress and it's metabolic stress. And these are downstream regulation of testosterone release at the gonads, comes from many different areas. You know, my work primarily looked at, you know, catacolymes and sympathetic arousal. So then it's like, up and air for an adrenaline. Correct. Yeah, up and air for an adrenaline, you know, an neurotrhenolene. How they were signaling that signal and cascade using the HPI axis, releasing cortisol and then, you know, looking at how that also influenced the adrenal medulla to release, you know, and then signaling that at the gonads. There are issues and issues in question. So in presumably weight training in women, people who don't have testes, also it increases testosterone. Yeah. And is that purely through the adrenals when women lift weights, their adrenal glands release testosterone? Absolutely. I mean, that is the only area of testosterone release for females. And yes, it's the same downstream cascade. Obviously, the extent to which it happens is significantly less in females. But that's how there's good data out there that shows, you know, females can increase their anabowlic environment. They're in turnlana, bolognic, miliou, using resistance training as a stressor. And then they get the consequent muscle tissue growth, you know, whether it's tendon, ligament, adaptation, you know, that the beneficial consequences of resistance training, which is driven by anabowlic stimuli. Yeah. I have two questions about that. The first one is something that you mentioned, which is that the, the, the endrogens, the testosterone comes from the adrenals under resistance loads. And women is the same true in men. I mean, we hear that the testes produce testosterone when we weight train for men that have testes. But, um, do we know whether or not it's the adrenals or the testes in men that are increasing testosterone more, both a little bit from each? The field is divided presently. And as much as understanding the acute adrenergic response in terms of, you know, anabowlic, um, response to exercise in an acute phase and the exposure to, um, you know, a stimulus that is stress-driven, which might be partly from the adrenal glands, partly from the gonads. This is a long-gutunyl exposure, um, to anabowlic environment, which is primarily driven by, obviously, the gonads and the release, the endocrine environment from from testosterone release at the gonads. So this, the, the field is split in terms of how exercise is promoting hypertrophy, you know, muscle tissue growth. And whether that is very much an adrenals, um, stimuli, or if that's significant enough in these acute responses versus the long-gutunyl exposure, just elevated base levels of anabowlic testosterone, uh, a bit your level. So it sounds like a most care, like with most things is probably the adrenal and then you mentioned that testosterone can have, um, enhancing effects, uh, growth effects on tendon and ligament also. That you don't often hear about that. People always think, you know, testosterone muscle, but testosterone has a lot of effects on other tissues that are important for performance, it sounds like, um, yeah, yeah, what's that? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think, you know, the, the testosterone hormone is, I mean, listen to the amdrogen receptors on, um, neural tissue, neural axons pretty much everywhere. So, you know, it, the binding capacity of testosterone and influence in different tissues within the body had touched on, you know, muscle tissue, but, you know, the ligaments, the tendons, and even bone to some extent, you know, testosterone is potential to influence that, um, in terms of removing osteopenic kind of characteristics, et cetera. So, um, yeah, it's, uh, it's a, it's a magic magic hormone, let's say, um, with many, uh, many end impact in terms of adaptation. I definitely want to get back to your trajectory, but as long as we're on the interactions between androgens, testosterone and its derivatives and different tissues, you know, from the work that you did as a PhD student, and, um, and throughout your career, could you say that there's a, there are some general principles of training that favor testosterone production in terms of, that, that, that, that somebody who's not an elite athlete could use somebody who's already adapted to weight training, somewhat, like they know, the difference between a dumbbell and a barbell, and they know, they know the various movements that are not going to damage themselves, but once they're doing that, I mean, I've heard shorter sessions are better than longer sessions, but in replodes, wait, now there's a lot of parameter space, but if you were going to throw out some of the, um, the parameters that you think are most important to pay attention to for the typical person, who's trying to use weight training to build or maintain muscle, yeah, lose body fat, so body recomposition, and or stay strong and healthy for sport, on a different kind. Yeah, so the work that we obviously, you know, I was exposed to back in my PhD, it was a double edged sword, and there's much as testosterone is really stimulated by an intensity factor, and also a volume factor. Now, growth hormone is a little bit different. That's largely driven by an intensity factor alone. Oh, really? I heard a lot that growth hormone was driven by volume, which just goes to show you, no, no, no, no, I think you're probably right, which just goes to show you that most of what's out there on the internet is completely, not only is it wrong, it's usually backward, so no trust, I, I don't know, trust your instinct because, because I think people just make this stuff up, right? Because it's very hard to measure growth hormone into testosterone, and I can't imagine most of the stuff that I see out there, they're taking drips and, you know, measuring free versus bound in all this kind of stuff, but that's what you do in laboratory. Right, yeah, you look at total composition, and you look at how much of that is free circuiting in the system, how much is bound, and therefore biologically active bound to receptor creating the adaptation. But yeah, coming back to testosterone, in terms of the training strategies, it's largely driven by both an intensity and a volume factor. So, if you look at many of the exercise interventions that we use to try and investigate and interrogate testosterone, it was, it was usually, you know, a 6x10 protocol. So, you touch, you know, 6x10 meaning, yeah, 6 sets of 10 repetitions, which is, you know, quite a large, you know, 60 repetitions is quite a large volume for a single exercise, and that was usually pitched about 80% in 10, over one repetition max intensity. Okay, so 80% of the one-rette max, 6 sets of 10 reps separated by rest of two minutes, which is actually pretty fast, at least to me. And in the end, when you see the two to three minutes, when you're actually watching the clock, those two-minute rest periods go by pretty fast. By the third fourth set, you're dying for more, yeah. And I think, you know, we, you know, we formulated that kind of exercise protocol to really target, you know, the release of testosterone and try and drive up these anabolic environments to study the, you know, the endocrine, you know, consequences. But I think that's, that's, that's the type of protocol that is most advantageous for driving anabolic environment. And that was it for the workout. Yeah, I mean, we would do that in a back squat, so, you know, multi-joint, you know, challenging exercise, multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% load of, of your one-repetition max, and then 6x10. We did play around with, you know, your classic German volume type 10x10, kind of protocols. But they were just unsustainable at that 80%. The key to what we also did was we always adjusted the loads to make sure that it was 10 repetitions that was sustained. So if the load was too high and then athlete or participant had to drop the weights on the six repetition, we would unload the bar and make sure they completed the 10 repetitions. Bringing me back to the point of it's an intensity and a volume derivative that is going to be most advantageous for testosterone really. That's really interesting. And one thing that you mentioned there is, especially interesting to me, which is you said, when you go from six sets of 10 repetitions to 10 sets of 10 repetitions, you, it's not as beneficial and might even be counterproductive, but to me, the difference between six and 10 sets is only four sets. It doesn't even sound that much. So that sort of hints at the possibility that the thresholds for going from a workout that increases testosterone to a workout that diminishes testosterone is actually a pretty narrow margin. Yeah, and I think it comes back to that intensity factor then, you know, what we saw that 10x10 protocol really sees pretty significant drop-offs in the load. And again, we're trying to stimulate with intensity, with mechanical strain, through intensity, as well as metabolic strain, through volume. And I think that's the paradigm that you've got to look at is that the mechanical load has to come from, you know, that the actual weight on the bar and the volume is the metabolic stimulus. How much are we driving, like, how much are we driving, you know, glycogenolysis in terms of that type of energy system for, you know, executing a 10x10 protocol and what we often saw was just a significant reduction in the intensity capabilities of an athlete to sustain that. So we shortened the volume to try and maintain the intensity. Interesting. And you could imagine just taking very long rest, keeping the session being a big lazy bearer and training. I sometimes do this. I tell myself I'm going to work out for 45 minutes and then two hours later, I'm done, but not because I was Huffing and puffing the whole time, but because I was training really slowly. Is there any evidence that training slowly can offset some of the negative effects of doing a lot of volume? Well, it's an old adage of, you know, two responses to your question. I mean, the first one I would say, you know, there's a difference between 10 sets of 6 and 6 sets of 10. And I think that comes back to the volume conversation. You know, 6 sets of 10 is driving up metabolic stimulus. If you're doing 10 sets of 6, you can probably take it to a higher intensity, but you're not going to get the same metabolic load. You're not going to get the same internal metabolic environment, the drives the lactate release that they will end signal, you know, further anabolic testosterone release because of the lactate in your body. That's a key consideration. The rest is often the consideration that's overlooked out there in general population and in many sports environments. You know, that the rest is is as important a program invariable as the load and the intensity, the load, the volume, etc. And yes, if you if you extend the volume, if you extend the duration of your rest periods, what you're ultimately doing is influencing that metabolic stimulus again. You were allowing the flushing of the body, the removal of waste products, you know, lactate to be, you know, removed from the body and then the metabolic environment is reduced. So you want, so if I understand correctly, you want to create a metabolic stress. So so the way that I've been training slow and lazy is not necessarily the best way to go. I could I could in theory do a 45 or 60 minute session where I pack in more more work per unit time. I'm not going to be able to quote and quote performance well. I won't be able to lift as much. I'm not going to unweight the bar between sets or maybe even during sets if I have someone who could do that. But it sounds like that's the way to go. So it's got to be so this the old adage of high intensity short duration is probably the way to go. Correct. And you know, in in layman's terms, if the same objective, the same training goal is just muscle tissue growth. And we're not talking about maximal strength or any of those type of parameters. We're just talking about growing muscle. If there's an athlete A and they do six six sets of 10 with two minutes rest and there's actually B that does six sets of 10 with three minutes left rest. Athlete A will likely see the highest muscle gain muscle type of a gain because of the metabolic stimulus that that driving with the shoulder rest period. Interesting. And for all the years that I've spent exploring exercise science and trying to get this information from the internet in various places that this is the first time it's ever been told to me clearly. So basically I need to put my ego aside and I need to not focus so much on getting as many reps with a given weight and keep the rest restricted two minute about two minutes. Yeah, get the work in and then I'll derive the benefits. I mean, you've absolutely nailed it to be honest. And again, if you think about human nature and how we approach to we're inherently lazy, right, as as as humans, we want to, you know, we want to take that rest. We want to take the time out to recover and feel refreshed, but we're trying to create a training stimulus. We're trying to create a very specific stimulus internal to the body and that is often driven by the metabolic environment at that moment in time. Now if we allow the metacup, the ballic environment to change by extending the rest periods, we're not going to see as beneficial gains at the end of it. It is very much a motivational and ego thing. Rather than saying, okay, I'm going to push my load as high as I can and really challenge maximal strength to do fewer repetitions, take longer periods of time. It's a completely different approach to training. It's a different end goal. Interesting. You mentioned lactate. So it seems still a bit controversial as to what actually triggers high-perature for you here about lactate build up. People with the common languages, the muscle gets torn and then repairs, but I don't know, does the muscle actually tear? I mean, microchomini. This ropes in the mic within the muscle tissue. Interesting. And we're talking now about non-drug assisted people who's, let's just say, let's define our terms here. Who's testosterone levels are within the range of somewhere between 300 and 1500 or whatever 1200. Because it does seem that athletes who take high levels of exogenous and antigens can do more work and just get protein synthesis from just doing work. I've seen these guys in the gym, right, the hotel signs are not that hard to spot where they're just doing a ton of volume, not necessarily moving that much weight. They're just bringing blood into the tissue and then they're loading up on their eating a ton of protein, presumably because they're basically in puberty part 15. Right. They got on their 15th round of puberty where during puberty, you are approaching synthesis machine. I mean, that's to me that's pretty clear about puberty. Interesting. So, and then in terms of, because I know the audience likes to try protocol, so that you described a protocol very nicely. What about day-to-day recovery? I mean, the work out of you described is intense, but short, how many days a week can the typical person do that and sustain progress? Yeah, I mean, I think that comes back to you training, age and you're trying to history. Obviously, there's a resilience and a robustness with an incremental training age. So, you know, that's not a protocol that I would advise anyone to go out and start tomorrow. They'll be mobbing them off the jet floor. But at the same time, it's also relative, right? So, 80% of you, it'd be a maximum at a young training age. It's still 80% versus, you know, been training 10 years. It's still 80%. But yes, the mechanical load is going to be significantly, it's just more tonnage, right? But yeah, I think a protocol like that, we would look at two times a week, something that's pretty intensive like that, because again, it comes back to the point you make is that you really need to be just one of better terms suffering a little bit through that type of protocol, both in terms of the challenge of the load, but also being able to tolerate the metabolic stress that you're exposed to. It's a bit of a sicko feeling, right? Because of the lactate that you drive in up. So, you know, I wouldn't promote as an athlete doing that type of modality, you know, multiple multiple times. You're from the realms of bodybuilding, and then you really, that's the sole purpose of what you're trying to achieve. Most athletes in most sports have diverse requirements in terms of outcomes that they're trying to achieve. They're not just targeting muscle growth. Muscle growth is a conduit to increase strength, increase power, increase speed, obviously. So, yes, trying to get bigger cross sectional area of a muscle means that we can produce more force into the ground, or wherever it may be, if we're a locomotive athlete, but usually sports, men and women are not just purely seeking muscle growth. They look for different facets of muscle endurance of maximum muscle power, muscle strength, you know, so then you've got to be very creative in how you build the workout. If it's a bodybuilder, absolutely, they're chasing muscle growth, and they're going to do so with these types of protocols, which sees high intensities and high volumes of workload on a pretty regular basis. If it's just somebody, you know, a weekend warrior that wants to keep in shape and look good, I would say, you know, two times a week for a really challenging workout like that, and then flex the other types of workouts within the week to have more of a volume emphasis, where you reduce the intensity and you might just look at, you know, larger, your rep range is from 12 to 15 to 20, another workout where you're looking at, you know, reducing the volume, but increasing the intensity and really trying to drive, you know, a different stimulus to give you more end points of success. Great, no, that's really informative. Along the lines of angergen's and intensity, when I think intensity, I think, up and effort in adrenaline, and since you have a background in catacolomins and testosterone, last time I was here at the USC Performance Institute, we had a brief conversation, and I want to make sure I got the details, right, that in the short term, and a big increase in stress hormone, can lead to an increase in testosterone, like a parachute jump, but so stress can promote the release of testosterone. That was news to me. We always hear about stress, suppressing testosterone, stress, suppressing the immune system, all these terrible things, but in the short term, you're saying it can actually increase the release of testosterone. So I have that right. Correct. And so then the second question is, does my cognitive interpretation of the stressor make a difference? In other words, if I voluntarily jump out of a plane with a parachute, does it have a different effect on my testosterone than if you shove me out of the plane against my will? What presumably with a parachute? Right. So this was what all my PhD work was looking at was the, the, the pre, the exposure to a stressor, and the pre-arousal of how your body essentially prepares for that stressor, and then how it manages it throughout the exposure to the stress, and it was actually motivated from parachute jumpers. There was an older study looking at parachute jumpers into into combat, and then, you know, they were studying, you know, the cortisol, the stress response, the epinephrine response of these parachute jumpers. So we got us thinking about hold on, you know, the certain workouts that you do that are just the daunting, you know, it's like, okay, it's squat, squat Saturday or whatever it may be. Oh my gosh, this is going to be a, is going to destroy me. Right. Or after talk to this person, I don't want to talk to, or, you know, or, right, I mean, something or PhD dissertation exam or something. Even public speaking, whatever it may be. Now, you know, we, we used an exercise, we used a resistance training protocol that, that these athletes knew was going to be very, very challenging. It's going to be, that it's going to have some anxiety to doing it, then you're going to be some physical distress from doing it. And, and therefore, you know, then their mindset of how they were going to approach that was already set. So what we saw prior, you know, 50 minutes prior to the start of the next exposure to the workout, that the epinephrine, the neurodrenaline, the adrenaline was already starting to prepare the body sympathetically. And to go into what it knew was going to be a very, very challenging workout. So that brings you back to, you know, exercise preparation, competition for certain preparation for certain competition, excuse me. You know, pre workout routines, the use of music, you know, all these different things that we know can now, you know, anecdotally in the gym, we put into place, but, you know, the data that I presented to show that it was the first of its kind to show that this link between, you know, epinephrine and neuropinephrine release and arousal and then consequent performance. So force output throughout the throughout the workout was intimately linked. So what's the, what was the takeaway there? Should, is it beneficial for people to get a little stressed about the upcoming impending event, whether or not it's a lift in the gym or whether or not it's talking to somebody that you might be intimidated to talk to or an exam, is it, is the stress good for performance or is it harmful? Yeah, and I think that's a great question. And I think I can only talk to, you know, physical exerge, which is what we were, we were exploring and I don't want to try on the toes of the psychology, so it's with flow, these types of things because clearly, I think you're in the position of scientific strength on this one. I think you have the leverage, I mean, I mean, most, you know, I have a lot of friends in that community as I'll just say, as a buffer to your, the answer you're about to give that there's, there's very little science around flow and there's very little neuroscience, really, the most psychological states anyway. So I think we've got a lot of degrees of freedom here. All right. Yeah, I'll, I'll take it all. I'll be anything you like, credit dunking, anything you dislike, something you send the mean comments to me. All right. Yeah, I think from from my day to certainly, the greater the rousal, the higher the performance was from a, from a physical exerge and perspective. And I think that was the intriguing part of some of my findings, where there's definitely an individual bio kinetics to some of these hormonal kind of releases in as much as those guys that had the highest, you know, adgeny, it response in terms of epinephrine release, neuropinephrine release, also sustained force output through for a longer period of the workout than those that didn't. So the, the the individuals that adds a lower stimulus of the sympathetic arousal, let's say, certainly didn't perform as well throughout the work. Now, the intriguing thing then becomes is okay, and I think this, this, you know, really segways into what what we're doing here with, with, with combat athletes with mixed martial artists, you know, that there's a philosophy there's a paradigm now from a self in terms of the exposure repeat exposure, you know, the, the more you do that challenge and work out, do you get the same psychological stimulus, do you get the same stress response, and, and the assumption is unlikely, you know, you accommodate, you become accustomed to the stressor, your body will therefore adapt, and that's the classic overload principle, right, and you then need to take the stress down a different route. But, I think when you look at, you know, the, the athletes that we work with here, it's, it's a fist fight at the end of the day. That's, there's nothing more stressful of that, but I think just the exposure to the rigors of training to understand the bad positions, the bad situations, to know that they can get out of certain situations that have certain, you know, submission holds or whatever it may be. I think that really ties in with some of my PhD work in terms of what these guys do to approach what is, you know, really challenging, spult and arena in mixed martial arts. Yeah, it's definitely the extreme of what's possible in terms of asking does stress, favor or hinder performance, because, yeah, like you said at the end of the day, it's someone trying to hurt you as much as they possibly can within the bounce of the rules, and you're trying to do the same. So, that's, you know, I find that your thesis work fascinating, where, where you never to be at the, you have to see performance institute, luckily they made the right choice and brought you here. But where you have never to come here, I, I was still fascinated by this because over and over, we hear that stress is bad, stress is bad, but everything I read from the scientific literature is that stress and epinephrine in particular is coupled to the testosterone response to performance and to adaptation, and it's provided it doesn't go on too long. So, unless I'm saying something that violates, that's your work, so it's really important and beautiful work, and I refer to it often, so I'm just glad that I, thank you. We could, you know, bolt that down because I think the people need to know this, that discomfort is beneficial. Now, there's another side to this that I want to ask about, which is the use of cold, in particular things like ice baths, cold showers, or any other type of cold temperature exposure, you know, in theory, that stress also, it's epinephrine. And so, how should one think about the use of cold for recovery? So, if it's stress, how is, if it's stress, if cold causes stress, then how is cold used for recovery? That's what I don't understand, and maybe you just want to share your thoughts on that. Yeah, no, and I think, you know, it's a great question. And I think the jury is still out there, certainly, and knowing some of the conversations that we've been having, but I think, you know, when we talk about stress, it's the classic fight flight of freeze approach. And, you know, throwing your body into, you know, a cold tub, a nice bath or whatever it may be, certainly is going to have a physiological stress response. Now, people are using that for different end goals, and again, I think that's where the narrative has to be explained. If you are using that stress specifically to manage the mindset to use it as a specific stress stimulus, that's the same as me doing 6x1080%. You know, you're just trying to find something to disrupt the system, to do something that's very, you want to better to painful discomfort, whatever. You're just finding a stressor and then being able to manage the mindset. But if you're using cold specifically from a physiological perspective to promote, you know, redistribution of a muscular, you know, a blood flow, you know, to different muscular areas of muscle that you feel have gone through a workout, that it damaged or whatever it may be. I think there's, we've got to understand what that stress mechanism is. And, you know, the, the data, the literature is certainly still out there with respect to cryotherapy and cold baths, and some of these, you know, high, these, these cold exposures in terms of what they do at the level of the muscle tissue. If that's, if that's the target, if you're trying to promote a flushing mechanism, or you're trying to promote redistribution of the blood flow, what you've got to understand is that cold is going to clamp down every part of the vascular system, and we've really got to understand how the muscle would be redistributed to areas of interest. So, you know, I think the stress response is is is is a real thing with respect to, you know, cold exposure. But I think the narrative around what are you using the cold for has to precede the conversation because yes, it's, you know, it's like putting your hand over a hot cold, you know, that's a stress the same way as jumping in a cold bath is. I think most people don't realize that you're going to get the up and effort release from holding your hand up to close to the flame. And you're going to get it from getting in the ice bath. And your body doesn't know the difference, right? Your body does not know the difference. It has a, you know, a primordial kind of physiological response that it's created over millions and millions of years. And I think that that's that physiology is is not changing, and it's fixed in a particular way right now. That that it doesn't understand the difference between whether it's six by ten doing a challenging workout over here, whether it's put my hands on the hot cold, whether it's a lion stood in front to me or whatever, that epinephin response from the, the level of the brain down to the, the whole signaling cascade is is the same. And cold, I've heard can actually prevent some of the beneficial effects of training that it can actually get and get in the way of muscle growth, etc. Yeah, this, this, this is some pretty robust dates out there now showing that it definitely has an influence on performance variables like strength and power in particular. And but absolutely in terms of muscle hypertrophy and there's a big kind of theme in in the world of athletic performance right now in terms of pure ideation of cold exposure as a recovery modalities. And so when do you use cold, you know, should you be using cold for recovery in periods of high training load when you're actually pursuing, you know, maybe general proprietary for priority work. We actually trying to pursue muscle growth. Well, that's usually where you get the most saw it's usually where, you know, you feel the most fatigue. It's probably not the most beneficial approach to use an ice bath in that in that scenario because you're dampening you're dueling the, you know, the mentor pathway and the, the high, high patrophic signaling pathway. Whereas in a competition phase where actually quality of exercise and quality of execution of skill and technical work has to be maintained. And you want to throw the kitchen sink of recovery capabilities and recovery interventions in that scenario because you know, the muscle building activity should be in the bank. That should have been done in the general preparatory work and now you're focusing on technical execution. So you're absolutely right. You know, it's interesting. So if I if I understand correctly, if if I want to maximize muscle growth or power or, you know, improvements and adaptations, then the inflammation response that the laid on set muscle soreness, all the stuff that's uncomfortable and that we hear is so terrible is actually the stimulus for adaptation. And so using cold in that situation might short circuit my progress, but if I'm, you know, I don't know that I'll ever do this, but if I were to do an iron man or something or run a marathon under those conditions, I'm basically coming to the to the race. So to speak with all the power and strength I'm going to have and so they're reducing inflammation is good because it's going to allow me to perform more work essentially. Yeah, you have to be strategic about when you use some of these interventions and you know the the time when you're preparing for a competition is not the appropriate time. Excuse me, is the appropriate time when you want to drive recovery and make sure that your body is optimized. You know, when you're far away from a competition, you know, date or you know, out of season or whatever it may be and you're really trying to just tear up the body a little bit to allow it to it's natural, you know, healing and adaptation processes to take place. Well, you don't want to negate that, you know, you want the body to optimize its internal recovery and that's how muscle growth is going to happen. So interesting that there's a time kind of consideration that you need to make with these interventions for sure. And you see performance center that are the fighters periodizing their cold exposure or they just see doing cold cold at will. Well, it's not just the UFC and again, I talk about my personal experiences with different sports. I think just education around where science is at and I understand of concepts like the use of cold exposure for recovery, ice bath, you know, everyone wants to jump in a nice bath. I think as we've, as we've stepped back and scientists have started to say, have started to figure out and look at some of the data, you know, we're now more intuitive about well actually that might not be the best or the most optimal approach and I think that's the tiny given sport. So yes, certainly here at the UFC, we're trying to educate our athletes around, you know, appropriate timing and it's the same with nutrition is the same with an ice bath intervention, it's the same with lifting weights, it's the same with going for a run or working out on the bike, you know. There's the tactics to when when you do things and when you don't do things and I think, you know stress and cold exposure. We have to have a consideration around that as well, but it's not just, you know, MMA fighters, that's any athlete and I think it's the best, the best professionals, the most successful professionals do that really well. They only listen number one, they educate themselves and then they build structure and I think, you know, at the most elite level, we always talk about it here at the UFC, but the most elite level. You're not necessarily training harder than anybody else. Everybody in the UFC trains hard, like everyone is training super hard. But the best athletes, the true elite levels are the ones that can do it again and again and again on a daily basis and sustain a technical output for skill development. Therefore their skills can improve or physical development, their physical attributes can improve. So that ability to reproduce on a day to day basis falls into a recovery conversation. Now when is the right time to use something like an ice bath and when is and is part of the high performance conversation? It's really their scientists, their building structure, they're figuring out variables. Yeah, but it sounds like the ability to do more quality work over time is one of the key there. I mean it's fundamental. I mean, garbage in, garbage out, quality in, quality out. But in our sport, you know, I talked about, you know, mixed martial arts, it's truly a decapital on of combat. So there's so many different attributes where it's a grappling, where it's a wrestling, where it's a transition, where it's a stand-up striking. So the different facets of a training program in this sport are significantly large compared to something like, you know, a wide receiver and football. And that's no disrespect for wider receivers, but they run routes. They're going to run a route of a passing tree. And that's all they need to do. These guys have to be on the ground. They've got to be grabbing the ground. They've got to be great standing up. They've got to be great with the thick, you know, the back against the fence. So there's so many different kind of facets to our sport. So managing the distribution of all the training components is one of the biggest challenges of mixed martial arts. And the best guys get that right. They allow their body to optimize the training. And remember why are we doing training? We're doing training for technical and tactical improvement. Now if you if your body is fatigue or you just can't expose yourself to more tactical development or technical development, then you essentially do yourself a disservice. You're going to be behind the curve with respect to those guys that can reproduce that day in day art. On the topic of skill development, regardless of sport. We hear all the time. And it certainly is intuitive to me that the person who can focus the best will progress the fastest. But it's kind of interesting. So I know as I talked to athletes and they seem a little bit laid back about their training sometime. And yet they obviously know how to flip the switch and they can really dial in the intensity. Do you think that there are optimal protocols for skill learning in terms of physical skill learning? Like could it ever be parameterized like the six sets of 10 reps? You know, in this gets to the heart of neuroplasticity, which is still, you know, it's not a black box, but it's kind of a black box with portions of it illuminated. I like to say, but what are your thoughts on skill development? Is there for somebody that wants to get better at sport? Do you recommend a particularly long or short training session? It doesn't intensity matter. Or is it just reps? Yeah, I think it no. It's not a volume driven exercise. It's a quality driven exercise. And listen, my expertise is not in motelurning and motel skill acquisition. I tend to default to gabbyl, we'll fear at UNLV for that. She's one of the leading proponents in this area, but you know, if you look at, you know, it's true skill development. It is about rehearsal of accurate movement, accurate movement mechanics. And as soon as that becomes impacted by fatigue or inaccurate movement, you're now losing the motel learning. You're losing the accuracy of the skill that people can call it muscle memory or whatever they want, right? But essentially you're grooving neural axons to create movement patterns. And they're situational throughout sport, right? You know, whether it's a kreif turn in soccer or a jump shot in basketball or a forehand down the line, you can carve out that particular posture and position and skill and you can isolate it. And you can drill it again and again. Again, as soon as fatigue is influencing that repetition, it's time to stop. And the best coaches understand that. They understand that it's quality of a quantity when it comes to skill acquisition. So to answer your question in a roundabout way, I would say yes, it's it's it's shorter sessions that are very high quality. And I think the best athletes in my experience are the ones that consciously and cognitively are aware of it at every moment of the training session. They should they should leave the training session not necessarily just physicality, but mentally fatigue because they're completely engaged in the learning process. The problem then becomes okay if we just do lots of, you know, 30 minute sessions. We've got to do a lot of 30 minute sessions to get the volume exposure of the repetition and the rehearsal of the skill again and again and again. And then you can do a little bit of a paradox, it's a bit of a double edge sword, but you know, a three hour session versus a 90 minute session. We'll take the 90 minute session any day when it comes to skill acquisition because that's going to be driven by quality of a quantity. Yeah training and skill learning is incredibly mentally fatigue. I've often wondered why when one works out hard when it's with you know, run or with the weights, why it's hard to think later in the day. But there really does seem to be something to it. And I've wondered is it depletion of adrenaline dopamine? I sometimes think it might be dopamine in here. I'm totally speculating out any data to support this, but if you hit a really hard workout or run early in the day. Oftentimes the brain just doesn't want to do hard mental work, which gives me great admiration for these athletes that are drilling their mind and body all day every day. With breaks, but so what do your thoughts? What leads to the mental fatigue after physical performance? Well, again, I don't want to talk out, you know, talking to the man here, you know, this is... Well, we're just too scientists. On this point, up until now we've been, you've been giving us concrete peer reviewed study based feedback on my questions, but but if we were to speculate, I mean, I think this is a common occurrence. People think if I get that really good workout in the morning, I feel better all day. That's true unless that workout is really intense or really long. Yeah. And then you just, the mind just somehow won't latch on to mental work. Right. What is well? I mean, just philosophically, and I think there's a coming back to this kind of stress consideration, you know, like a public speaking or taking an exam. I mean, if you have an amazing coach who is setting up training in a particular way, it's challenging. The strain related to it. And I'm not talking physical strain. I'm talking figuring things out, you know, figuring out the skill. And I think that can be stressful, like the learning process can be stressful. So, you know, we've touched on stress. I also think if they, if they hit the right technique, you know, that reward center in the brain that dopamine shot is going to fly up there. And there's only so many times that we can get that before it becomes dampened. And I think there's an energetic piece to it. You know, there's the fueling of the brain. There's the, the carbohydrate fuel and exercise that actually the strategy around how you fuel for learning and fuel for physical training is actually pretty similar. Yeah, it's it's glucose. It's sugar at the end of the day, right? So, you know, are you, are you you're fueling accordingly around your training sessions be that very physical because everyone thinks, okay, you know, I'm going to jump on the treadmill and I'm going to bang out, you know, 15 sprint. So, that max effort and I'm going to, you know, be dropping off and lying on the floor at the end of it, I need to refuel. Well, what about the refueling of the brain in a very demanding exercise or drilling session where you're looking at technique that you're trying to figure out this very challenging for your mind to figure out the complexity of it. And it still needs to be fueled or refueled afterwards. And I think that's obviously, you know, might be an area where athletes do themselves a disservice by not appropriate fueling from what might be considered to be a lower intensity session, but the, the, the cognitive challenges have been significantly high. And it's still work or drill work and it's taxing the brain at the end of thinking, oh, you know, I wasn't, you know, pushing hard lifts or doing sprints. And so I can just go off and the rest of my day, but then their, their mind is drifting. Yeah, I'm in. I speculate. Yeah, that seems very reasonable. I mean, I know that here and presumably with the other athletes you've worked with a nutrition is a huge aspect of that. And I think that general public can learn a lot from athletic nutrition because at the end of the day, the general public is trying to attend to their kids, attend to their work whether they're lawyers or whatever. They need to focus nutrition is a barbed wire topic. Oh, yeah. But if, if, since we're free to do what we would do if we were just sitting in each other's offices, which is to just speculate a bit for the typical person. All right. Do you think these low carbohydrate diets, typical person who exercises run swims yoga lifts weights, maybe not all those things, but some collection of those is pushes themselves to do those things and to do them well, but isn't necessarily a highly competitive athlete. Do you think that nutrition that doesn't include a lot of glucose doesn't include a lot of carbohydrates is a problem or is it okay? What do you recommend for athletes? What do you recommend for typical people? Yeah, again, disclaimer. I'm not a dietitian, but I, that's okay. The dietitians don't know what to recommend to athletes either. And I say that from having this been a lot of time with the literature now. It's a complete mass. Yeah. It's like I thought we didn't understand anything about the brain, the nutrition science stuff is all over the place. Right. So I think we have again a large, a free-to-date, right? I mean, I think, you know, I think it comes down to metabolic efficiency. So we would never, we would never advocate a high, never say never. Okay, but you know, we rarely advocate a high performance athlete in a high intensity intermittent sport like MMA. Being totally ketogenic or you do not recommend that. No, because at the end of the day, some of those high intensity efforts usually require, you know, carbohydrate fueling for the high end and the energy. The energy is produced at those high intensity. So we try to navigate around that. Now, the listener are fighters in the UFC and elsewhere. Matt Brown is a great example who promotes the ketogenic approach and it works for him. But we look at the science and the nature, the characteristics of our sport and we don't necessarily promote that. Can I interrupt you real quick? What about ketones for people that are ingesting carbohydrates? This is an interesting area because people always hear ketones and they think, oh, I have to be ketogenic to benefit from taking ketones. But there are a number of athletes and recreational athletes now as well taking liquid or powder based ketones on even though they do in eat rice and oatmeal and bread and other things. So are there any known benefits of ketones, even if one is not in a state of ketosis? So the only use of ketones that I'm primarily aware of is in our sport is after the event, you know, in terms of the brain health with athletes that take, you know, potentially taking trauma to the brain, etc. And looking to maintain the fueling and the energy supply to the brain. But yes, it's probably a little bit of my remit. So I don't want to talk on that because I'm not fully familiar with that. But for the ketones after head injury can provide a buffering component. It's not going to reverse brain damage, but it might be able to offset some of the micro damage. Right. So that's how we use it. Just to sustain, you know, the energy supply to the brain that might be compromised through brain trauma. So that's why we use ketones. To combat the original question, if it's a, you know, general population, then yes, I think there's a place to argue that actually being on a key to genetic diet at times and maybe that's to cycling exercise. Maybe not, you know, don't mean cycling and bike. I mean cycling ketosis is beneficial because I think it's going to lead to better metabolic management and better body deficiency. There are those lower intensities where we should be fueling our metabolism with lipids and bats. Clearly the Western diet and, you know, the Monday diet is heavily driven by processed foods and carbohydrates that, you know, people become predisposed to utilization of that fuel source. Both lipids use fat use, and the intensities that are very low. So, you know, some of our data with the fighters shows that as well. But I think the challenge for us is that we're working with a clientele that require high intensity, about severe effort. So, you know, fueling appropriately is very important for that. Now we use, we use tactics here where we essentially have athletes on what you would say kind of a, is it a larger, a ketogenic diet. But then we will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So we'll do very time to expose your to carbohydrates. So it's not post training post training immediately pre during and then immediately post and then the rest of their diets, you know, breakfast, lunch and dinner. What would look like ketogenic type approaches. So we're trying to be very tactical in the exposure to maximise the intensity for the training. And then return to a metabolic, efficient diet, which is heavily reduced in carbohydrates, right, because we've fueled the, the sessions that need it. And then we're trying to be very, very smartly because once again, this place, the UFC performance center is doing things scientifically, which, you know, to me, the idea and and I'm pleased to hear that because to me, that's idea that the ketogenic diet is the best and only diet or carbohydrates and low protein diets are the best diet. It's just it's ludicrous. Then you mentioned metabolic efficiency. I think some people might be familiar with that term, some perhaps not, but the way I understand metabolic efficiency is that you're, you teach the body to use fats by maybe doing long, long, long, bouts of cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates a bit, so teaching the body to tap into its fats, doors for certain periods of training. And then you also teach the body to utilize carbohydrates by supplying carbohydrates immediately after training and before training. Teach the body to use ketones and then you use them at the appropriate time as opposed to just deciding that one of these fuel sources is good and all the others are bad or dispensable. Do I have that correct? You nailed it. I mean, from Bob Seabahar, as formerly a USA triathlon, is the guy that kind of came up with the concept of metabolic efficiency, but yes, you're absolutely right. I mean, low intensities of exercise or just day to day living, we shouldn't be tapping into our carbohydrate fuel sources extensively. That's that's for higher intensity work or the fights of flight needs of stress. If athletes or any individual has a high carbohydrate diet, they're going to start to become predisposed to utilizing that fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity that can be problematic, certainly for an athlete because if they preferentially use carbohydrate, lower intensities, when the exercise demand goes to a higher intensity, they've already exhausted their fuel stores. You know, they can't draw upon fat because the oxidization of that fat is just too slow. So they're essentially now become fatigued because they've already utilized the carbohydrate stores. So what we try to do, yes, through diet manipulation and a little bit of exercise manipulation is as you say, teach the body or train the body to preferentially use a specific fuel source fat, obviously, lower intensities and carbohydrate high intensities. Look at specifically the crossover point between the two tells a lot in terms of how and athlete is ultimately, you know, how the metabolism is working. Well, again, I'm smiling because I love this because it's grounded in something real and scientific, which is that we have these different fuel sources. The body can adapt to use any number of them or one of them. I think most people are looking for that one pattern of eating that one pattern of exercising that's going to be best for them or sustain them. And they often look back to the time when they felt so much better switching from one thing to the next, but the adaptation process itself is also key, right, teaching the body. And I, so if we were to just riff on this just a little bit further, if somebody, I'll use myself as an example since I can only speculate what other people's current nutrition protocols are. If somebody is eating in a particular way and they want to try this kind of periodization of nutrition, could one say, okay, for a few weeks, I'm going to do more high intensity interval training and weight training and I'm going to eat a little bit more carbohydrate because I'm depleting more glycogen. Then if I switch to a phase of my training where I'm doing some longer runs, maybe I'm not maybe I'm training less, maybe I'm just working at my desk a little bit more, then I might switch to a lower carbohydrate diet. Do I have that right? And then if I'm going to enter a competition of some sorts, certainly not UFC or MMA of any kind to be clear. Not because it isn't a wonderful sport, but because it's that wouldn't be good for my other profession, but if I were going to do that, then I would think about stacking carbohydrates, key tones and fats. Is that, do I have that more strength? I think, yeah, you don't set it eloquently at the end of the day, you're consciously understanding what the exposure to physical exertion is and you're flexing your diet accordingly. So it's need-based eating. Exactly. If you're one of the veterans, you can call it whatever fancy terminology there is out there, but yes, it's needs-based eating. But you're very conscious and cognizant of what is my current exercise status. If I'm taking some time off, then don't go on the carbohydrates. We probably need to be good, it's going to be lower intensity work or even just habitual day-to-day walking around, doing your groceries. That doesn't require massive amounts of glycogen storage and carbohydrate, you're feeling. So you can potentially go more key to genetic in nature, oxidizing lipids for that fuel. If you are in a high period of high intensity training, then you have to consciously flex your diet to support that. That's not normal. You've made a change of elevated the demands, so the fueling requirements for the regenerative, not only fueling the exercise for the regenerative requirements of your body after that type of work, he's going to be really important as well. So yes, take on more carbohydrates. So I think it's consciously interpreting the nature of your diet against what, where you are at any moment in time. Like that, you know, I think the listeners of my podcast generally are experimenters. They are scientists of themselves, which makes me happy, obviously. And I like to think that they're paying attention to the changes they're making and how they're affecting themselves. And they seem more open to trying things, but they can do it safely, you know, and seeing what works for them. And I'm certainly going to try some of the change up. I also really a creature of habit. And I think the talking to you today, I realize I'm probably doing a number of things truly wrong in my training, but also that I don't tend to vary my nutrition with my training quite as much as I should. I'm just locked into a protocol. We covered a number of things related to your PhD thesis work, and then, but I cut you off early on related to your trajectory. After you finished your thesis, you, I know you were at Notre Dame for a while, was that your first spot after your PhD thesis? No, no, I basically finished my PhD and I dropped into the British Olympic system for about 14 years. Almost. I was with them. You know, I've done three full Olympic cycles with different sports and largely a strength and conditioning coach as a practitioner. I was always working in universities in academia alongside, you know, in terms of continuing to publish and write and do research and teach as well. Because that explains the importance of volume of publication. I don't think people realize the work that goes into getting an equality peer reviewed publication. It's not what what do they call it now on Instagram and Nicodata where people do something what, you know, They have this experience and then they put in the world that anecdata are, I don't even know that we could call it data, but so 14 years in that working with the British Olympic team. Yeah, so with, you know, whether it was GB boxing primarily with the reo, excuse me, the Beijing cycle, but also lightweight rollers and gymnastics and for the London Olympic Games, that cycle I was with, I was the lead surrounding audition in a physical performance coach for British basketball, so GB basketball. I had about three years in English Premier League with Newcastle United and the soccer team and then for the reo Olympic cycle I was with Great Britain, Taekwondo, so again, another combat sport. After I'd finished there, I kind of moved to the University of Notre Dame where I went into more of a, more of a managerial position working across all the different technical services, medical, nutrition, strengthening conditioning, you know, psychology and whatever it's sports science, whatever it may be. As the director of performance sciences for Notre Dame athletics and then after about 16 months there, the UFC came knocking and they recruited me out of Notre Dame, so it's been a great ride and lots of, you know, lots of athletes have taught me a lot along the way, lots of coaches, you know, every day is a school day. I still try and keep that mentality and you know, in this world we call it white belt mentality, you know, it's, you know, I'm a PhD, I've got 25 years of experience in high performance sport, but I still, I still learn every single day from these people out on the mat and in the ring and it's impressive to see what they do. Yeah, certainly as I, I'd got introduced them in May just a few years ago, I think the first time I came out here was one of the first times I'd heard of MMA because I was got in my laboratory and you know, nose down. And it's a really interesting sport because they incorporate so many different types of movement as you said, you know, it's not just stand up boxing, it's just kicking in the every, you know, ground game, everything and I'm still learning about it. But as you mentioned, going in with that beginners mind, the white, white belt mentality, what, what has been the most surprising thing for you in terms of being exposed to MMA in particular as both to other sports, like what's what's unique about MMA fighters besides that they have this huge variety of tactical skills that they have to learn and perfect. Yeah, that's a great question. I would say two thing, I'm going to answer two questions, one actually reiterates what you've already said. Like the degrees of freedom in mixed martial arts are exponential, like no other sport, you know. We've got 11 different white classes, we have men's classes, we have women's classes, we have, you know, kickboxes, wrestlers, judicis, fighters, judokas, you know, like karate fighters, you know, the stylistic backgrounds are infinite. And we have, we're a weight classification sport, there's a whole issue relating to making weight and then rebounding to fight about 24 to 30 hours. Like just the variability in this sport, the considerations that you have to make are unprecedented compared to any of the sport that I've worked with. And a lot of them go against and they are the antithesis of what you would expect for a high performance, you know, in terms of we don't always have a very clearly defined competition schedule. You know, once these guys fight, they don't necessarily know when their next fight's going to be. What's the closest spacing of a fight? I mean, listen, I think the record is around, it's just over a month, I believe, you know. So, you know, that's a quick turnaround, but most of these guys are fighting, you know, three or four times a year, three times a year is pretty normal. The bigger fights, maybe two times a year. But, invariably, the guys don't know when that next date is going to be. So, we're in this gray area of, okay, what do we do? Like are we taking some time off, are we just going to do some general prep work, are we going to try and keep this, you know, the knife sharpen, in case I get it. I didn't realize this in that way, it's a lot like special operations. Absolutely, you don't know when the call from the right, they have to be ready at all times. There isn't this like let's get ready for season. Right. Yeah, like when I was with the British Olympic Association, you know, on you, it was the British Open, the Spanish Open, the French Open, the European Championships. They're really open, American Open, the Canadian Open, the Olympic Games. You know, it's a circuit in your brain. Right. You do see this plums, like, you know, where all the targets are going to be. Here, it's a moving target because you might be just hanging out doing some general prep work and then you might get a short notice fight. They give you a quick call and send six weeks or five weeks and, okay, I've got to ramp everything up really quickly. So that's a real challenge in terms of just managing all these, these different components of mixed martial arts. Along. The other, to come back to you question the other thing which is truly fascinating about these individuals is there, just their mental resilience. And again, we've touched on it in the talk, but, you know, the ability to do what they do on a daily basis to look at all the different skill sets that they have to try and engage in and bring into their training. To do that and embrace the grind and embrace the process of just learning the physical side of our sport is unprecedented, but the mental side. We have a funny saying we always say it's 90% mental apart from the 60% as physical. So, you know, it's just, it's just more and more and more and these, these guys ability to just do that on a daily basis is, is very impressive. Like the resilience that their internal drive and their resilience is really impressive to see. You know, all the fires I've met here have been really terrific. It's interesting. Every time I meet a fighter, how often I, I shouldn't be surprising where they're often very soft spoken. Right. Always extremely pull out. Yeah. And fighting is such a, you know, it comes from a very primitive portion of the brain, right, is, but a large portion of the brain. But I think that's another skill is that switch, you know, and again, that's the recoverability piece, right? Like you cannot be type A or you cannot be like supercharged 24 hours a day because you're going to just fry your system, right? And I think that's something else where we're really trying to manage this whole process. Be it through nutritional interventions, be it through education around sleep, be it through training program management, be it through psychological interventions. You know, you could look at fights and say like these guys are go like that red alert and they will run through a brick wall, but actually, again, their ability to turn it on and off means that they can do what they do. You know, they can bring it down and be very normal, very very polite, very, you know, accommodates in maybe even better than most people because, you know, one of the reasons I'm obsessed with with human performance and high performance and that people like fighters and, you know, elite military or, or even bodybuilders for that matters that, that matters that they, they experiment, they find the outer limits of what's possible, but one of the things that they have discovered is you're describing is this ability to toggle between High alert states and calm states. Most typical people can't do this. They see something that upsets them on the internet or something on the news or some external event pressures down on them and they're stressed for many, many days and weeks and sometimes it goes pathological, right? And this, I don't say this as a criticism, it's just that most most human beings within our species, most members of our species never learn to, to either flip the switch or to just voluntarily toggle between states. I think athletes learn how to do that extremely well and it sounds like MMA fighters do that even better than perhaps many other athletes. I mean, yeah, there's the odd one or two that would struggle with, but I think in terms of that chronic exposure, we see that coming from challenges around, you know, cyclical weight cutting and metabolic disruption and metabolic injury, not necessarily from the psychological drive. You know, they do understand that this is a job for them and the time on the maths, you know, most of them can turn it off a little bit and downgrade things when they're off the maths. It's impressive to see because again, like as a layman just looking at the fight game, you think, you know, it's going to be crazy chaotic 100 miles an hour every hour of every day, but that's not, like it's clearly not the case. They, they manage their energy and their efforts pretty well. It's just a little bit like science although maybe scientists could take a lesson from us. Yeah, it's practice, practice, both of them. I'm a couple more questions. I can't help myself. I know we talked about temperature earlier when we discussed cold, but I can't help myself. I have to ask you about heat because earlier we were having a conversation about heat adaptation about how long does it take for the human body or athlete or typical person that's maybe exploring sauna or things that sort. To learn to be a better sweater sounds like something not, not of us would want to do. We all want to say cool common collected, but one of the reasons to deliver exposed oneself to heat is for things like growth hormone release, et cetera. We talk about this, but a couple questions. One is heat exposure stress in the same way that the ice bath or cold exposure stress. Second one is there are any difference there. That's important. The other one is how does one get better at heat adaptation, at least what are you doing with the fighters to get them better at dealing with heat. How long does that take? The first question just because I threw three questions at you is, was, you know, is heat stress like cold stress? Yeah, I think it is. I think, you know, heat shock proteins, for example, driven by that stressful exposure to a changing environment. So I think, you know, it's, we do graded response in terms of heat acclamation strategies. But yes, we've touched on the earlier in the conversation for me, heat is still a stressor. And if it's managed incorrectly, you can have detrimental responses rather than beneficial responses. So borrowing like hyperthermia and death, like, I mean, obviously you heat up the brain too much. People will see years and die. But you lose neurons. But what's the right way to acclimate heat? Taking into account that people are, you know, to check with their doctor, etc. We do all these disclaimers. But, you know, but let's say I, let's just say I want to get better at dealing with heat or I want to extract more benefit from heat. Is, I mean, how many minutes a day are people typically exposing themselves to heat, how often and over how, what periods of time? Yeah, so we, we, we normally start with about 15 minutes of exposure. Now if someone's really lacking acclimation to heat, you know, you can do that in three, five minute efforts. Genonamine and actually take hot sauna. Yeah, hot sauna. Take time to step 200 degrees or something like currary. Yeah, yeah, 200 Fahrenheit. Yes. And we, we try to work up to 30 to 40 minutes to 45 minutes in the sauna continuous. Now, we have to understand, you know, what's the advantage of heat acclimation for our athletes? Ultimately, their ability to sweat and to lose, you know, body fluids is going to be advantageous to their weight cut process. So their ability to make weight. It is a technique that these guys get some of these guys adopt. So if you don't have, you know, high sweat rates, it means you're going to have to sit in the sauna for longer and longer, longer to get the same delta in sweat release. So the more acclimated you are, the more your body is thermogenic, genetically adapted, the more sweat glands you have, there's more pause. You can sweat more and therefore you'll lose that fluid quicker and you spend less time in the sauna. So that's why we do it to try and promote the limit the exposure. And it comes back to you first question is it a stressor? It's absolutely a stressor if you've got to spend, you know, two hours over, you know, over a four hour period, two hours of it. It's sat in a sauna because you wear the phone doesn't work. So you can't just ignore it. Just ignore it from their phone and that's a stressor in itself. Right. I mean, yes, I think, you know, there's a, you know, what we do is we, like anything. We build up in temperature, but we build up in volume of exposure. So, you know, we start with 15 minutes and then we just try to add on and add on across a time. And now for us, we kind of found about 14. So on our exposures starts to really then drive the adaptations that we're looking for. So it's not a quick fix. You know, a he acclamation strategy has to happen long before fight week or long before the fight. You know, this is a, this is a process that has to begin, you know, eight to ten weeks before the fight so that we can actually get that adaptation and that tolerance to the stressor to the exposure of heat. It is interesting until today when we talk about this earlier and again now, I didn't realize that, but it makes perfect sense. Now that I hear it, that he adaptation is possible that your basic and train the body to become better at cooling itself, which is what sweating is. I mean, I should have known that before, but, you know, you don't see that in the textbooks and so, yeah. Listen, it's, it's, it's the same as the ketogenic conversation, you know, you're training your body to be more better metabolic efficient, you're training your body to tolerate heat more, you're training your body. Like the body is, you know, as an organism, as an organic system, it's hugely adaptable. It's hugely plastic, but I think the skill is understanding the lens, the ways and the where-offs in terms of changing the overload, changing the stimulus to drive specific adaptation. And philosophically, that's how we go about our work here. We talk about adaptation-led programming. Now adaptation-led programming fits into every single category, not just lifting weights or running track. It fits into nutrition. It fits into sitting in the sauna. It fits into being in a cold bath or not. It fits into so many different things because we're driven by scientific insights. And that's how we really want to go about our business. I love it. I love this concept of adaptation-led programming and doing that, not just in the context of, you know, throwing another plate on the bar or something like that, but in every aspect of one's training and performance. And I think there's a lot here that's applicable to the recreational athlete too. Yeah, would you say that, you know, what comes to mind is 12 weeks. It feels like 12 weeks is a nice block of time for someone to try something in terms of to try something new. See how they adapt adapt and then maybe switch to something new. I realize that it's very hard to throw a kind of pan time frame around something, but in terms of someone wanted to experiment with heat adaptation or experiment with cold adaptation or change up their training regimen or or diet and look at metabolic efficiency. Do you think 12 weeks is a good period of time to really give something a thorough go and get and gain an understanding of how well or how poorly something works for oneself or would you say eight is enough for three. I mean, that's how long is a piece of string kind of response right. I mean, yes, if we're just talking about a traditional experience. Yeah, three months, six, 12 week training, you know, strategy 12 week intervention is more than adequate to say. For 99% of things that change within the body that physiologically adapt to a training stimulus or an overload stimulus, you're going to start to see either regression or progression, you know, beneficial or detrimental effects within three months. Absolutely, I would say so now listen to it. I say that in as much as we do training blocks here that are three weeks long, right. And I was just that's because of this constraint that sometimes people suddenly have to get the call to fight correct. Yeah, so it's like super condensed and you know, and that in that scenario, we're always conscious of is a body is a body or this individual. Do they have the ability to tolerate that super overload that like super condensed exposure now we might be doing that purposefully we might be trying to do an overreaching strategy where we're really trying to damage your flex something and not mean negatively damage but like we're trying to damage tissue to really getting an adaptive response versus, you know, more drawn out 12 weeks strategy, which is more coherent more planned out more structured in nature. Yeah, for all your listeners, I would say if 12 weeks to engage in a process of trying to change an adaptive body or expose yourself to something is more than sufficient to see if it's going to be the right approach for you. And I think you know, the the the the the individual interpretation is always has to be considered and I think that's where it comes back to to be a thinking man's athlete or be a thinking man's trainer like someone that's going through exercise. You have to you have to cognitive consciously understand where your body's at any moment in time, you know, you've got to be real with yourself you can create a journal create a log of your training, create a log of your feelings your subjective feedback of. You know, how you felt your mood, your sleep. Yeah, yeah, we tried to promote that because again, that's that's part of this this process, you know, maybe 12 weeks for you, but I might get the same responses in eight weeks, you know, and I think that's that's that's it another critical theme here is that, you know, we could put 15 guys on the mat and give them the same workout and there's going to be 15 different responses to that same workout. Because the human organism is so complex and in nature that it's going to adapt differently, you know, some people will tolerate it some people are going to be challenged by it. Some people have got a metabolic makeup that's going to promote it some people are met a metabolic, we challenge by it, you know, there's there's just so many different things that we have to consider and that's what we try to do here, it's across we bear is that we try to understand on an individual level how to optimize athletic performance. I think it's terrific and I know the athletes here are so fortunate to have this and most people out there. I've certainly been trying to encourage people to learn some signs and some mechanism and become a scientist of their own pursuits whether or not skill learning or athletic pursuit, et cetera. As a sort of a final question, what are some things about the UFC or something about the USC that perhaps people don't know in terms of its overall mission or what you guys are trying to do here. I mean, I think I've become a fan of MMA and I am more and more as time moves on. Some people might be in MMA, some people not into watching MMA, but what are some things that the USC is interested in and doing that most people might not know about it and certainly I might not know about. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, we try to be cutting edge, we try to be super progressive, you know, we think we've got an amazing platform here. Particularly the performance institute to do some really cool things that can inform many different people and that doesn't just mean the 600 or so athletes that are on our global roster. What we're trying to do is influence global community around optimizing human performance. So, you know, any moment in time we're engaging in different technologies with different vendors, different partners, you know, exploring opportunities to learn more shared data, understand what's the best mechanisms for, you know, interpreting your body, interpreting how your body is responding to training, interpreting, you know, your nutrition or whatever it may be. We get, we're really privileged position to do that. But we've also, you know, hence you've been here today, you know, we're also trying to venture into some really cool areas of science and research that's got applicability that you can take from high performance athletes and apply, you know, to yourself to, you know, Joe Blow walking down the street, you know, out there, that is really interesting and that's everything from, you know, whether it's CBD and psychedelics through to different technologies for, you know, thermal monitoring and Bluetooth, heart rate monitoring or whatever it may be through to data management, et cetera, and anything in between. We've got some great partners on the nutrition side on the psychology side on the data side and I think, you know, we always try to just push the envelope a little bit more. I think we keep our core mission with our athletes, but I think a lot of what we do, hence your podcast and you know, like an amazing platform, you do such a great job of it that, you know, we can all learn and take from, you know, the elite and interpret how it might help us and just in the general population. So I think that's, you know, that's our, our North Star is to provide our athletes the best integrated service of care. But we also want to influence, you know, just the global community and put, you know, you have to see at the forefront of that. It's great. Well, you guys are certainly doing that. We can't let the cat out of the bag just yet, but the things that we're gearing up to do with my laboratory and the work together, hopefully we'll be able to talk about that and share that in the year to come, but that's, we're very excited about that. And Duncan, look, you know, I have this, this filter that I use when I talk to people, academics or otherwise, which is, you know, some people, they open their mouth and it doesn't make much difference, but when you speak, I learn so much. I'm going to take the protocols that I've heard about today. I'm going to think about how I'm training and how I could train differently and better, how I'm eating, how I could eat differently and better for sake of performance and just in general. Thank you so much for your time. Your scientific expertise, the stuff you're doing in the practical realm, it's, it's immense. So hopefully we can do it again. Yes. Thank you. This has been a blast. I appreciate it. And yeah, keep doing what you're doing because, I know there's a lot of people out there that love the platform. So thanks for the invite. It's been awesome. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for joining me for my conversation with Dr. Duncan French. I hope you found it as insightful and informative as I did.

Many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discussed supplements, supplements for sleep, supplements for focus, and for other health benefits as well. While supplements may not be for everybody, if you're going to use supplements, you want to make sure that those supplements are of the very highest quality. For that reason, we've partnered with Thorn. THORN. Because Thorn supplements are of the very highest quality and the amounts of ingredients listed on the label of Thorn Supplements, precisely matches what is actually contained in those capsules, bottles, and pills, and powders, and so forth. This is extremely important. A lot of analyses of supplements and supplement companies have shown that what's listed on the bottle is often not what's actually contained in the bottle. Thorn stringency is unmatched. They've partnered with all the major sports teams with the Mayo Clinic. And so there's a lot of trust in Thorn supplements for all the right reasons. If you'd like to try Thorn supplements, you can see the supplements that I take. You can go to Thorn.THORN.COM slash the letter U slash Huberman. There you can see the supplements that I take.

vid00016," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast, where we discuss science, science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Roko. Roko makes sunglasses and eyeglasses, and I'm delighted that they're a partner and a sponsor for the podcast. As some of you may already know, I've spent two decades or more studying the visual system. How we see vision is absolutely the most important sense by which humans navigate the world and survive, and our eyes as two pieces of our brain do many other important things as well. So taking good care of our eyesight is essential. Founded by two all-american swimmers from Stanford, Roko was born out of an obsession for performance. They carefully put science and purpose behind their design choices and they've built absolutely terrific products as a result. The glasses are amazing. I love them because they look great. They are super comfortable and the optical clarity is incredible. They filter out sunlight in a way that still allows you to see contrast and shadows the way you need to. For me, one of the things that's really irritating is if I have a pair of sunglasses that don't allow me to see all the things I want to see. And with Roko glasses, I get incredible contrast, but then I can also relax and be outdoors and bright light. And as the amount of light changes with cloud cover and things of that sort, my ability to see my surroundings is still really sharp and really clear. That only comes from really understanding how the visual system works and how it adjusts to contrast and adaptation and all these different things. They really understand the science and that went into the design of these glasses. And as many of you know, sunlight in the viewing of light is also very important for setting circadian rhythms. So that's also been incorporated into the design and science behind these glasses. I do wear readers. I don't often wear them during the podcast, but I have to wear reading glasses at night. So I use their readers and I own a pair of their sunglasses and I'm delighted with them. If you'd like to check out Roko glasses, you can go to roca.com.

I'm a big believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the important things that are vital to our immediate and long-term health can only be detected in a good quality blood test. The problem with blood test is that most blood tests, you get a lot of information back about levels that are too high or too low of this thing or the other thing. But making sense of that and what to do with that information is very challenging. Even if you have a really attentive physician, oftentimes it's mysterious as to what to do with all this data. Within Side Tracker they make it very easy to understand what all the metabolic factors, hormone factors, etc. Mean for you and what to do about those markers. So they offer you directives in terms of nutrition, supplementation, as well as lifestyle factors like exercise, sleep, etc. That can allow you to take control of those numbers and bring them into the ranges that are best for you and your long-term health. Another feature of Inside Tracker that's great is their inner-age test. This test shows you what your biological age and how it compares to your chronological age, which I can only imagine most everybody including me are extremely interested in how long and how likely to live, how old am I really in terms of my biology?

Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. With Athletic Greens, you get a ton of factors that are good for you mixed into this one really good tasting drink. I like to mix mine with water and a little bit lemon juice and I drink that once or twice a day, typically once, early in the day, and sometimes also in the afternoon or even evening. I'm able to sleep after drinking in the evening just fine. The reason I've been using Athletic Greens for so long that I continue to use Athletic Greens is that one, I feel better when I take it. I just do psychologically, physically, I feel better, but also it covers all my bases of the things that I need for my general health, sort of a foundational supplement, as I like to call it. In fact, when people ask me what should I take, if I were to recommend just one supplement that people take, it would be Athletic Greens. With Athletic Greens, you get support for your gut, which is important because the gut microbiome is important for the gut brain access for mood metabolism, hormones, et cetera. There are so many data that support that statement. As well, there are many factors in Athletic Greens that support general health, metabolism, and other factors in immunity, et cetera. So with Athletic Greens, I drink it once or twice a day and I know that I've got all that covered. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to AthleticGreens.com-Huberman. If you do that, you can claim a special offer. They'll send you 5-free travel packs plus a year supply, excuse me, a Vitamin D3 and K2. So you get the 5-free travel packs and a year supply of D3. If you go to AthleticGreens.com-Huberman, you can claim that special offer. For the last month, four episodes to be exact, we've been discussing physical performance and skill learning. We've talked about how to learn skills faster, whether or not those are skills for athletic performance, dance, music, things of that sort. We've also talked about how to gain strength and how to lose fat faster by leveraging the nervous system. Things like shiver and non-shiver, non-exercise activity-induced thermogenesis. We talked about how neurons can actually trigger accelerated fat loss. We talked about hypertrophy, also called muscle growth. We covered everything from sets and reps, protocols, how long to stay in a cold ice bath, when to get out, how to keep shivering. We've covered a lot of tools and a lot of science. If you're interested in those things, you perhaps want to learn a little bit about how we make energy ATP from carbohydrates or from fats. It's all covered in the previous four episodes. This was going to be the time that we moved to a new topic entirely, but we are going to do one more episode in this series on physical performance. For the simple reason that you asked many questions about something that's vitally important, both for physical performance and long-term and short-term health. And that's endurance. Today we are going to talk about endurance. If you're a strength athlete or you're not interested in endurance, don't depart just yet because it turns out that there are ways to train endurance that are very different than I would have previously imagined. If you only think about long-runs, long-swims, marathons, half marathon, ten-case, five-case, and that sort of thing puts you to sleep. That costello is snoring in the background right now. He's not a long-distance endurance athlete. That's for sure. If you're interested in those things, or if you are averse to those things, I encourage you to continue listening because we are going to talk about a little bit of science and then some specific protocols that really define what endurance is, the four types of endurance and ways to train those in concert with the other things that you might be doing like weight training or skill training or yoga. And if you are an endurance athlete, we are going to cover a lot of tools and science that I'm certain will also help enhance your training and performance in races or even just recreationally. The topic of endurance, I think, has been badly misrepresented, frankly, online. And when you start digging into the science and you start talking to real experts in this area, what you discover what I've discovered is that it's an incredibly interesting area because it teaches us so much about how our body and our brain use fuels and how we can control which fuels are used by our body and brain. So today we will talk about the four kinds of endurance. We will also cover the topic of hydration which might sound incredibly boring like, okay, I just drink more water. But it's really interesting because not only is hydration a limiting factor on performance, but there is a right way to hydrate and there is a wrong way to hydrate. There actually is a formula that I'll teach you to know how much water to be drinking, depending on your activity levels. And if that sounds like a simple thing like, oh, just tap off water until you're in runs clear, that's actually the wrong advice. It turns out that if you don't hydrate properly, you can see 20 to 30% reductions in performance, whether or not that strength, whether that's increasing hypertrophy, whether or not that's running swimming, even mental performance. So even if you're not athletes or recreational athlete at all, I encourage you to stay tuned for the part about hydration. So we're going to cover as usual a little bit of science and then we're going to dive right into protocols that you can apply if you like and if you deem those correct and safe for you. Before we dive into all that, I want to make an important announcement which is all the episodes of the Human Lab podcast are now housed on a single website, which is HubermanLab.com. You can find all the episodes in YouTube, Apple and Spotify format with links there. The website is also searchable. So if you go into the little search function, which you'll find very easily and you put in, for instance, creating or sleep or ice bath or sauna, it will take you to the specific episodes that contain that information. And in addition, if you go to the website, HubermanLab.com, you have the opportunity to sign up for what we call the HubermanLab neural network. The HubermanLab neural network is a zero-cost resource where once a month, perhaps more often, you'll receive a email newsletter and that newsletter will contain specific protocols, announcements, attachments of PDFs and things of that sort of protocols, tools and science from the podcast. We will also make any announcements about live lectures, which at some point I'll probably start doing in various cities in the US and probably around the world as well, as well as other things that I think would be really useful to you, all of course, at zero-cost. So that's HubermanLab.com. Sign up for the neural network newsletter. You can find that in the menu tab or it might pop up when you get there. And I hope you will join. And as a final announcement, if you're not already following us on Instagram, you can go to HubermanLab on Instagram. And if you do that, I often make announcements and release protocols and links to protocols and things there as well. I briefly want to touch on something from the previous episode, which is that if you are somebody that is trying to increase muscle strength and or size, or if you're simply somebody who doesn't want to increase muscle strength and size. And you just want to maintain the musculature that you have. It's vital that you perform at least five sets of resistance training per muscle per week. If we don't do that, we lose muscle over time. And that is one reason among many to have a regular resistance training protocol. Nobody wants to start resembling a folded over envelope or a melted candle. No one wants to have challenges getting up out of a chair or off the ground. Maintaining musculature is vital not just to our immediate health, but to our long-term health trajectory. So I just want to emphasize that point. If you're curious about the sets, the reps, how close to failure to go or not go, whether or not you should be doing your cardiovascular training before or after your weight training. All of that is in the previous episode, right down to the details, and I like to think it made simple for you to understand. But I do strongly believe that resistance training, whether or not to with body weight or bands or weights or simply lifting rocks in the yard or logs in the yard, is vital for our systemic physiology and our overall health. And that includes our brain health. And I describe the reasons for that and the mechanisms in the previous episode. Today I'd like to talk about endurance and how to build endurance and how to use endurance for the health of your entire body. Endurance as the name suggests is our ability to engage in continuous bounce of exercise or continuous movement or continuous effort of any kind. And I do believe that our ability to engage in activities that we call endurance training or physical endurance activities do have carry over to mental performance of things that require long-term effort. I'll touch on that at the end and why there's reason to believe that there's a biological crossover between those two things. I don't think it's simply the case that if you train yourself to be a strength and speed athlete and to do short bounce of exercise that are very intense, that you can only do mental work that's of short bounce and very intense. But it is clear that cardiovascular exercise, exercise where you're getting your heart rate up continuously for a period of time and endurance exercise we will define what that is in a moment is vital for tapping into and enhancing various aspects of our body. Of our biology in the body and in the brain such that our brain can perform work for longer periods of time focused work learning, etc. So I want to dive into the topic of endurance and I want to just begin by addressing something that's vital to any kind of effort, whether it's mental effort or physical effort. So as always a little bit of science and we get right into protocols. So the key thing to understand about energy production in the body, meaning your ability to think, your ability to talk, your ability to walk, your ability to run is this thing that we call ATP. ATP and mitochondria which are just little what we call organelles within cells. So it's a little factories that make energy, if you will. ATP is required for anything that requires energy, for anything that you do that requires effort. And there are different ways to get ATP and we have been gifted as a species with the ability to convert lots of things into ATP. We can convert carbohydrates. Literally the kinds of carbohydrates. You eat a bagel, you eat a piece of pizza pizza. Pizza usually is dough and it has cheese and some other things. Costile here is when you talk about pitae. Costile loves pizza by the way. Eating a piece of pizza pizza it gets converted into various things fatty acids from the fats, glucose from the bread, and those things get converted into ATP within cells. Through things like like coluses, things like lipoluses. I talked about this in previous episodes. So our muscles and our neurons use different fuel sources to generate ATP. The ones that are used first for short bouts of intense activity are things like phosphocreatine. If you've only heard about creatine as a supplement, well phosphocreatine actually exists on our muscles. And that's why people take creatine. And load your muscles with more creatine. And those, and excuse me, phosphocreatine is great for short intense bouts of effort. So when you're really pushing hard on something physical, let's say you see a car on the side of the road. And that car is stalled and the person's hey, can you help me push my car and you start to push. Let's be phosphocreatine is going to be your main fuel source. Then you start to tap into things like glucose, which is literally just carbohydrate. It's your sugar that's in your blood. And then if you keep pushing on that car, you keep engaging in a particular effort. Or you keep studying or you keep listening to this podcast. You start to tap into other fuel sources like glycogen from your liver, which is just, it's like a little pack. Just like, you know, you might have packed a sandwich or something for work. You have a little pack of glycogen in your liver that you can rely on. And you have fat stored in adipostissue. Even if you have very, very low body fat percentage, like you're one of these. People as like 3% or 5% body fat really thin skin very little body fat. You can extract lipids fatty acids from that body fat. It's like a storage pack. It is a storage pack for energy that can be converted to ATP. So without going into any more detail, when I say today energy or I say ATP, just remember that regardless of your diet, regardless of your nutritional plan, your body has the capacity to use creatine glucose, glycogen, lipids. And if you're ketogenic ketones, we'll talk about ketosis in order to generate fuel energy. Now, the other crucial point is that in order to complete that process of taking these fuels and converting them into energy, most of the time, you need oxygen. You need air basically in your system. Now, it's not actual air. You need oxygen molecules in your system. It comes in through your mouth and your nose goes to your lungs and distributes via the bloodstream. Oxygen is not a fuel. But like a fire that has no oxygen, you can't actually burn the logs. But when you blow a lot of oxygen onto a fire, basically onto a logs with a flame there, then basically it will take fire. It will burn. Oxygen allows you to burn fuel. So today, we are going to ask the critical questions. What allows us to perform? What allows us to continue effort for long periods of time? And that effort could be a run. It could be a swim. It could be studying. It could be anything that extends over a long period of time. Well, you're going to need energy and you're going to need oxygen. But the way to answer a question, like, what allows us to endure, right? Endurance. What allows us to keep going? Well, we think of things like willpower, but what's willpower? Willpower is neurons. It's neurons in our brain. We have this thing called the central governor, which decides whether or not we should or could continue or whether or not we should stop, whether or not we should quit. Okay? So whether or not you're somebody who has a lot of what we call resilience and endurance or whether or not you're somebody who taps out early and quits early or can't handle frustration, that has to do with your fuel utilization and specific neurons. So we have to ask the question, what is the limiting factor on performance? Right? So instead of saying, what allows us to endure? We should say, what prevents us from enduring? What prevents us from moving forward? What are the factors that say, you know what? No more. I'm not going to continue this run or you know what? I've had a really long hard day or maybe I've had an easy day or I'm feeling lazy. I just don't even really feel like getting up and moving. So what we're going to talk about today actually gets right down to the heart of motivation and fuel use, motivation and fuel allocation. And we are going to talk about specific training protocols that you can follow that have carry over between the bodily systems of running, swimming, et cetera, and the way that your brain works. So let's talk about endurance by asking first what are the limiting factors on endurance? What stops us? Because in addressing that and answering that, we will understand what allows us to get into effort and to continue effort. There are five main categories of things that allow us to engage in effort. And they are neurons, nerves, muscle, muscle, blood, things in our blood. Our heart and our lungs. Now, I don't want to completely write off things like the immune system and other systems of the body, but nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs are the five that I want to focus on today because that's where most of the data are. As we go forward into this, I want to acknowledge Dr. Andy Galpin who, as with the last episode, has been tremendously helpful and informative in terms of the exercise physiology. His true expert. He has a laboratory, he's a full professor who does work on muscle biopsy who understands the science, but who also works with athletes and works with recreational athletes, professional athletes really understands. And a variety of levels how all these systems work. He's the person I consulted with about today's episode, although I did access other literature as well. And I'm going to mention a key review for any of you, aficionados who really want to get down into the weeds. But I encourage you if you want more detail to check out Dr. Andy Galpin's YouTube page. I think he's also on Twitter. He's definitely on Instagram. His content is excellent and he really understands. I have learned and I really believe that an intellectual is somebody who understands a topic at multiple levels of specificity of detail and can communicate that. And Andy is a true intellectual of muscle physiology and performance. And if you hear the word intellectual and you kind of back up and cringe from that, understand that he's also a practitioner. So thank you Andrew Galpin and the Galpin for your support in these episodes. And we hope to have you as a guest on the podcast soon. So nerve muscle blood, heart and lungs. Let's talk about neurons and how they work. Okay, but I want to tell you about an experiment that's going to make it very clear why quitting is a mental thing, not a physical thing. So why do we quit? Well, an experiment was done a couple years ago and was published in the journal cell cell press journal, excellent journal. Showing that there's a class of neurons in our brains, them in the back of our brain that if they shut off, we quit. Now, these neurons release up an effort. Appanethrin is adrenaline. And anytime we are engaged in effort of any kind, we are releasing up an effort. Anytime we're awake, really, we are releasing up an effort into our brain. In fact, this little group of neurons in the back of our brain is called the locus seruleus, if you like, is churning out epinephrin all the time. But if something stresses us out, it turns out more and then it acts as kind of an alertness signal for the whole brain. We also, of course, have adrenaline up an effort and release in our body, which makes our body ready for things. So think about epinephrin as a readiness signal. And when we are engaged in effort, this readiness signal is being churned into our brain. When we're relaxed and we're falling asleep, epinephrin levels are low. Okay. So they did a really interesting experiment where they had subjects engaged in bouts of effort of trying to move forward toward a goal. But they manipulated the visual environment with these stripes, kind of like fences passing on both sides of them. And by doing that, they could trick subjects into thinking that their effort was either allowing them to move forward, right? Because these rungs on the fence were moving past, or that their effort was futile, that they were no longer moving forward, because they would make the rungs move slowly even though the subjects were making a lot of effort to move forward. Okay. So this is analogous or similar to being on a treadmill, and you're trying to walk on this treadmill, and you just can't move the conveyor, right? Or you're in virtual reality and you're putting a ton of effort, but it seems like you're moving excruciatingly slow. I had this experience recently in real life. I was doing a swim in the Pacific. I was trying to go south. I was swimming and I was caught in a current, not the pulls you out to ocean, and I kept looking to my left, and I saw this hotel on the shoreline, and then I was swimming and swimming and swimming and swimming, and 20 minutes later, I looked to my left, and the hotel is still exactly where it was before, which meant that I wasn't moving. It felt futile. Eventually, either the current changed or something changed, and I eventually swam past the hotel, got back on the beach, and eventually drove home. That's essentially what they did in this experiment, but what they found was these neurons that release epinephrine. There's another cell type called Glya, which actually means glue in Latin, that is paying attention to how much epinephrine is being released, and at some point, the system reaches a threshold. It reaches this threshold, and it shuts off the release of more epinephrine. It's like a... I quit, that's it, no more effort signal. If they could extend the time before those Glya said, enough, if they could release more adrenaline into the system, then subjects will keep going. So our desire to continue, or put differently, our willingness to continue, and our desire to quit, is mediated by events between our two ears. Now, that doesn't mean that the body's not involved, but it means that neurons are critically important. So we have two categories of neurons that are important. The ones in our head that tell us to get up and go out and take that run, and the ones that allow us, encourage us to continue that run, and we have neurons that shut things off. It's a no more. And we, of course, have the neurons that connect to our muscles and control our muscles. But the reason we quit is rarely because our body quits are mind quits. Now, we never want to encourage people to drive themselves to the point of injury. That's not going to be good for anybody, but it is good to know that it's neural. Our ability to persist is neural. So when people say, is it... I hear that, you know, sports are effort or fighting, or it's 90% mental, 10% physical. You know, that whole discussion about how much is mental, how much is physical is absolutely silly. It just proves that there's no knowledge of the underlying biology behind that statement. It's neither mental nor physical. Everything is physical. Everything is neurons. Your thinking is the responsibility of chemicals and electrical signals in your head. So it's not 90% mental, 10% physical. It's not 50, 50. It's not 70, 30. It's 100% nervous system. It's neurons. Okay? So when people say mental or physical, understand it's 100% neural. And I'd love for the... how much of it is mental and how much is physical to just disappear. That argument means nothing and it's not actionable. Now, what do nerves need in order to continue to fire? What do you need in order to get neurons to say, I will persist? Well, they need glucose. Unless you're a keto and ketogenic adapted, you need carbohydrate. It's glucose. That's what neurons run on. And you need electrolytes. Neurons have what's called a sodium potassium pump. Blah, blah, blah, blah. They generate electricity. We could go into all this. I will probably do an entire lecture about the action potential. But basically, in order to get nerves, nerve cells to fire, to contract muscle, to say, I'm going to continue. You need sufficient sodium salt. Because the action potential, the actual firing of neurons, is driven by sodium entering the cell, rushing into the cell. And then there's a removal of potassium. And then there's a kind of resetting of those levels, by something called the sodium potassium pump. And the sodium potassium pump and sodium and action potentials. Even if you don't know anything about that, is ATP dependent. It requires energy. So you need energy in order to get neurons to fire. And it is pH dependent. It depends on the conditions or the environment within the brain, being of a certain pH or acidity. pH is about how acid or how basic the environment is. And we will talk a little bit about pH in simple terms that you can understand. So nerves need salt. They need potassium. And it turns out they need magnesium. And unique glucose and carbohydrates in order to power those neurons, unless you are running on ketones. And to run on ketones, you have to make sure that you're fully keto adapted. I will talk about adding in ketones on top of carbohydrate at the end of the episode. Okay, so that's how nerves work. You need carbohydrate. You need sodium, potassium, and magnesium in order to drive the brain. Muscle. Muscle is going to engage in generating energy first by using this phosphocreatin system. High, bouts of effort really intense effort. Short lived. Seconds to minutes, but probably more like seconds is going to be this phosphocreatin. Literally, a fuel source in the muscle that you're going to burn. Just like you would logs on a fire. And glycogen, which is stored carbohydrate in the muscle. That also can be burned. Just like logs on a fire to generate energy. So let me make this crystal clear. If you move your wrist towards your shoulder and contract your bicep really hard. Muscle fibers are burning up their own carbohydrate. They're converting that into ATP in order to generate that energy. Okay? And pH is important. And temperature is important. In the episode on supercharge your physical performance, I talked all about how by using cooling specifically of the palms or the bottoms of the feet or the cheeks of the face. Using particular methods. You can adjust the temperature of the body and of muscle in a way that allows you to do more work to do more reps to run further to keep going and to persist. And that's because if temperature is too low or too high, then ATP is not going to be available. Because of this whole thing called the pyruvate kinase pathway and the temperature dependence of pyruvate kinase. Check out that episode if you want to learn more about that. But temperature is important and pH is also important. So we got nerve muscle and then there's stuff in our blood that's available as an energy source. And in blood we've got glucose. So literally blood sugar that's floating around. So let's say you have fasted for three days. Your blood glucose is going to be very low. So that's not going to be a great fuel source. But you will start to liberate fats from your adipose tissue from your fat. Fadi acids will start to mobilize into the bloodstream and you can burn those for energy. And oxygen in your blood. When you inhale, you bring oxygen in your blood. So these are all fuel sources in your neurons, in your muscle, in your blood, in your various tissues that are providing the opportunity to give effort to induce effort. Whether or not it's a runner, a swim or writing or talking. Now there are some other factors that are important. And those are the heart which is going to move blood. So the more that the heart can move blood and oxygen. Well, the more fuel that's going to be available for you to engage in muscular effort and thinking effort. So your heart is vitally important to your muscles ability to work and your brain's ability to work. And as I've mentioned, oxygen a few times. It should be obvious then that the lungs are very important. You need to bring oxygen in and distribute it to all these tissues because oxygen is critical for the conversion of carbohydrates. And the conversion of fats. And we could get into the discussion about whether or not oxygen is important for ketogenic metabolism. But you need oxygen there. You need to breathe and you need to breathe properly. So I just covered what would normally be about four lectures of energy consumption and energy utilization. I didn't go into much detail at all. But what I want you to imagine is that you've got these different cell types. You've got neurons. You've got muscle. They need to collaborate in order to generate effort or to make the decision to do something or to think hard or to run hard or to run far. And then you've got fuel sources both in the neurons, in the muscle, in your blood. And then the heart and lungs are going to help distribute the oxygen in those fuels. And of course you have that little energy pack that we call the liver that will allow you to pull out a little more carbohydrate. If you need it for work. Okay. So that's as much as I want to cover about energy consumption because that's a lot. But what it tells you is that when you eat and you use food as a fuel source, that food can be broken down and you can immediately burn the glucose that's in your bloodstream or you can rely on some of the stored fuel in your liver. Or you can rely on stored fuel in the muscle, so called glycogen. And there are a lot of different ways that we can generate ATP. So when we ask the question, what's limiting for performance? What is going to allow us to endure to engage in effort and endure long bouts of effort or even moderately long bouts of effort? We need to ask which of those things, nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs is limiting. Or put differently, we ask what should we be doing with our neurons, what should we be doing with our muscles, what should we be doing with our blood, what should we be doing with our heart and what should we be doing with our lungs that's going to allow us to build endurance for mental and physical work and to be able to go longer further with more intensity. That's the real question. How can we do more work? And the way we do that is with energy and the way to get energy to it is to buy those five things. And so now we're going to talk about how you can actually build different types of endurance. And what that does at the level of your blood, your heart, your muscles and your neurons. So we're going to skip back and forth between protocols, tools and the underlying science. So rather than heavy stack the science at the front end and then just give you all the tools at the end. We're going to talk about the protocols, the four kinds of endurance and how to achieve them. And we are going to talk about the underlying science as we move through that. If you would like a lot of detailed science, I encourage you to check out a review that we've linked in the show notes. And the review is called adaptations to endurance and strength training. This is a review article with many excellent citations. It's from Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine. The Cold Spring Harbor Press is an excellent scientific press. It's been the last 21 years doing summers at Cold Spring Harbor teaching neuroscience. But Cold Spring Harbor is involved in all sorts of themes and topics related to neuroscience and medicine. This review by Hughes L. L. Fesson. L. Fesson. That's the name. L. Fesson and bar BAA are adaptations to endurance and strength training. Is rich with citations. It can be downloaded as a complete PDF. There's no paywall and we will link to it. And it gets really deep into all the signaling cascades. The genetic changes within muscle with high intensity interval training. Short term super high intensity training. Weight training. So if you're a real nerd for this stuff and you want to get right down into how PGC1 alpha p53 and pH 20. Change the adaptation features of muscle and gene regulation. That is definitely the review for you. If you're like most people and you're not really interested in that level of detail, No reason to pick up the review unless you just want to check out some of the figures and pictures. But I do want to offer that as a resource. It's been in addition to discussions with Dr. Andy Galpin. It's been a primary resource for the content of this episode. So let's talk about the four kinds of endurance and how to achieve those. I do believe that everybody should have some sort of endurance practice, regular endurance practice. It's clear that it's vital for the functioning of the body and the mind. And there are clear longevity benefits. There are a lot of reasons why that's true. But the main one is that if we have good energy utilization in our musculature and in our blood in our vasculine, blood in our vascular system and in our oxygenating system, our lungs, the so called cardiovascular system, respiratory system and musculature, the body and brain function much better. There are so many papers now, so much data to support that. So I do believe everyone should either try to maintain the muscle that they have, provided they've already gone through puberty and development, and they should be engaged in regular endurance exercise. Now for many people, they think endurance exercise, that means what? Our long run or I gotta get on the stairmaster or I have to treadmill for hours on end each week. In terms of that's not the case, there are four kinds of endurance and you can train specifically for any one of those. And you can vary your training. So let's talk about those four kinds of endurance. They're very interesting and they each have very different protocols that you use in order to build and maximize them. And now you'll understand what fuel sources they use in order to build that thing we call endurance. So first of all, we have muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is the ability for our muscles to perform work over time, and our failure to continue to be able to perform that work is going to be due to muscular fatigue, not to cardiovascular fatigue. So not because we're breathing too hard or we can't get enough blood to the muscles or because we quit mentally, but because the muscles themselves give out. One good example of this would be if you had to pick up a stone in the yard, and that stone is not extremely heavy for you, and you needed to do that anywhere from 50 to 100 times, and you were picking it up and putting it down and picking it up and putting it down and picking up and putting it down. At some point, your muscles will fatigue, they will fail to endure. Muscular endurance is incredibly useful for a variety of physical pursuits, and we'll talk about the mental pursuits that it supports as well. In terms of physical pursuits, the ability for a given muscle to perform repeated work is going to improve your golf swing. It's going to improve your tennis swing. It's going to improve your posture, your ability to dance, your ability to repeatedly engage in an activity that requires effort. In a way that's very different from the kind of endurance that you will build simply by increasing your cardiovascular fitness, your ability to generate kind of easy repetition. So let's talk about muscular endurance and what it is. Muscular endurance is going to be something that you can perform for anywhere from 12 to 25, or even up to 100 repetitions. That's actually how if you like you would train muscular endurance, and I'll give the specific protocol in a few moments. A good example is push-ups. If you were to get on the floor and start doing push-ups, even if you're somebody who has to do knees down push-ups, and you're doing your push-ups, eventually you won't be able to do any more push-ups, and that's not going to be because you couldn't get enough oxygen into your system, or your heart wasn't pumping enough blood. It's going to be because the muscles fail. That's why. So if you want to be able to do more push-ups, or even more pull-ups, muscular endurance is really what it's about. It's actually no coincidence that a lot of military boot camp style training is not done with weights. It's done with things like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and running. Because what they're really building is muscular endurance, the ability to perform work repeatedly over time for a given set of muscles and neurons. So what's a good protocol to build muscular endurance? Let's just give that to you now and explain some of the underlying science as it follows. So a really good muscular endurance training protocol, according to the scientific literature, would be three to five sets of anywhere from 12 to 100 repetitions. That's a huge range. Now 12 to 25 repetitions is going to be more reasonable for most people. And the rest periods are going to be anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds of rest. So anywhere from half a minute to three minutes of rest. So this might be five sets of push-ups, done getting your maximum push-ups for some people that might be zero, and you have to do it knees down for some people it might be ten push-ups for some people it might be 25, but you could go all the way up to 100 rest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds, and then do your next set for a total of three to five sets. So it doesn't actually sound like a ton of work. The other thing you could do is something like a plank. A plank position is actually a way to build a muscle. Way to build muscular endurance. Not strength. Okay? I'm sure it could be used to develop strength, but it's really about muscular endurance. So you would do three to five sets of planks. Those planks would probably, because you're not doing repetitions, it's an isometric hold, as we say. It's kind of static hold, or a wall-sit would be another example. And you would do that probably for a minute or two minutes, take some rest of anywhere from 30 to 60 or 180 seconds, and then repeat. So things like pushing a sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups. Those will all work. And as with other forms of training, you would want to do this until you approach failure, or actually fail, and where you're unable to perform another repetition, that would mark the end of a set. The one critical feature of building muscular endurance is that it has no major e-centric loading, now I haven't talked much about e-centric and concentric loading, but concentric loading is when you are shortening the muscle, typically, or lifting a weight, and e-centric movements are when you are lengthening a muscle, typically or lowering a weight. So if you do a pull-up, and you get your chin over the bar, or chin up, that's the concentric portion of the effort, and then as you lower yourself, that's the e-centric portion. E-centric portion of resistance training of any kind, whether or not it's for endurance or for strength, is one of the major causes of soreness. Some people will be more susceptible to this, to this, excuse me, than others, but it does create more damage in muscle fibers. Muscular endurance and building muscular endurance should not include any movements that include major e-centric loads. So if you're going to do push-ups, it doesn't mean that you want to drop, you know, smash your chest into the floor, and by the way, your chest should touch the ground on every push-up. That's a real push-up, okay? It's not about breaking 90 with the elbows. It's about pushing down until your chest touch the floor and straightening out. That's a proper push-up, and a pull-up is where you pull your chin above the bar. Neither of those should include a slow e-centric or lowering component, if you are using those to train muscular endurance, it's a 3-5 sets of 12 to 25, and maybe even up to 100 repetitions with 30 to 180 seconds of rest in between. That means that jumping also is going to be a very poor tool for building muscular endurance, because jumping has a slowing down component as you land. So things like plyometrics or agility work where you're moving from side to side, and you're deselerating or slowing yourself down a lot, not going to be good for muscular endurance. Terrific for cardiovascular training and conditioning of other kinds and skill training and agility and all that, but if you want to build muscular endurance, you want to make your muscles able to do more work for longer. It's going to be this 3 to 5 sets of 12 to 100 reps, 30 to 180 seconds of mainly concentric movement, okay? Not a slow lowering phase or a heavy lowering phase. So that might be kettlebell swings and things that sort. Isometric as I mentioned, things like plank and wall sits will work. Now what's interesting about this is that it doesn't seem at all like what people normally think of as endurance, and yet it's been shown in nice quality peer reviewed studies, several of which are cited in the review I mentioned earlier, that muscular endurance can improve our ability to engage in long bouts of what we call long duration, low intensity endurance work. So this can support long runs, it can support long swims, and it can build also, it can build postural strength and endurance simultaneously. And that's mainly accomplished through isometric holds. So things like planks are actually quite good for building endurance with less spinal erected muscles that provide posture of the abdominal muscles that are helpful for posture for being upright for the upper neck muscles and things of that sort. These days everyone seems to have text neck, everyone's basically staring at their toes. All the time it has a default towards their toes. So isometric holds can be very good for building muscular endurance. You can spot people including yourself, perhaps with poor muscular endurance in the postural muscles because anytime they stop moving they have to lean against a wall or their hip will move to one side or they're always lean to one side. I am guilty of this too. Some of you have actually pointed out, I like to think out of concern, that I often am rubbing my lower back and indeed I have some asymmetries in my postural muscle, some of which are probably genetic and some of which are probably just from excessive work or something in that sort that have my right shoulder sit lower than my left and things that sort. If I wanted to improve those, by really focusing on symmetry and isometric symmetry, meaning holding my hands at equivalent positions in planks and doing isometric holds for building muscular endurance of the postural muscles. But this can also be done with, as I mentioned, kettlebell swings for the lower back and legs and posterior chain. So there are a number of different exercises you could do this with, but it should be compound exercises mainly. It's rare for people to do this kind of muscular endurance work, specifically for things like bicep curls or triceps. And there aren't many activities that really rely on isolation of those muscles repeatedly. I'm sure there are some out there, but it's kind of hard to imagine. So you can do this with isometrics. You can do this with more standard non isometric type movements, but make sure there isn't a strong eccentric load. So now let's talk about the science briefly of why this works. Well, that takes us back to this issue of fuel utilization. And what fails? So if we were to say, okay, let's say you do a plank and you're planking for, you know, maybe you're able to plank for a minute or two minutes or three minutes. At some point you will fail. You're not going to fail because the heart gives out. You're not going to fail because you can't get enough oxygen because you can breathe while you're doing that. You're going to fail because of local muscular failure, which means that as you do, if you choose to do this protocol of three to five sets, et cetera, et cetera, to build muscular endurance, mainly what you are going to be building is you're going to be building the ability of your mitochondria to use oxygen to generate energy locally. And that it's something called mitochondrial respiration, respiration because of the involvement of oxygen. And it's also going to be increasing the extent to which the neurons control the muscles and provide a stimulus for the muscles to contract. But this is independent of power and strength, okay? So even though the low sets, like three to five sets and the fact that you're doing repetitions and you're going to failure, even though it seems to resemble power and strength and hypertrophy type training, it is distinctly different. It's not going to generate strength, hypertrophy and power. It's going to mainly create this ability to endure to continually contract muscles or repeatedly contract muscles. Okay? Continually, if you're using isometric holds, repeatedly, excuse me if you're using repetition type exercise, where there's a contraction and an extension of the muscle, essentially a concentric and any centric portion. But remember that you want the eccentric portion to be light and relatively fast. Not so fast that you injure yourself, but certainly not deliberately slowed down. It was recommended, I should say, by Andy Galpin, that you not use Olympic lifts for this because once you get past eight or 12 or 25 repetitions, especially form on those Olympic lifts is key for not getting injured. And while some people can perform those sorts of lifts like snatches and dead lifts and clean and jerks and overhead presses, probably not a great idea. If the goal is to push the body to points of fatigue because you do open yourself up to injury, unless you're very skilled at doing that, or you have a really good coach who can help you guide through those lifts. So that's one form of endurance, which is muscular endurance, mainly going to rely on neural energy, so nerves and muscle. And it's not going to rely quite so much on what's available in your blood, your heart, or your lungs. So now let's talk about the other extreme of endurance, which is long duration endurance. This is the type that people typically think about when they think about endurance. You're talking about a long run, a long swim, a long bike ride. Well, how long will anywhere from 12 minutes to several hours, or maybe even an entire day, maybe eight or nine hours of hiking or running or biking? Some people are actually doing those kinds of really long events, marathons, for instance. So anything longer than 12 minutes. And this type of work builds on fuel utilization in the muscles. It builds on the activity of neurons in the brain that are involved in what we call central pattern generators. We talked about this in a previous episode, or several previous episodes. These are groups of neurons that allow our body to engage in regular rhythmic effort without having to think about the movement too much. So running and stepping or swimming if you already know how to swim or pedaling on a bike or walking upstairs and hiking. You're not thinking about right left, right left. It's all carried out by central pattern generators. This is going to be at less than 100% of your maximum oxygen uptake, your VO2 max. I'll talk about what VO2 max is, but I just want to give a sense of what the protocol is and the underlying science. How many sets? One. Long duration effort is one set of 12 minutes or longer. So you're not counting repetitions. I sure hope that if you're going out on a 30 minute run or even a 15 minute run that you're not counting steps that you're not counting pedal strokes. That you're not on the rower counting poles on the rower. I suppose you could, but I think that would be pretty dreadful. Seems like a poor utilization of cognitive brain space. You're getting into regular repeated effort and your ability to continue that effort is going to be dependent mainly on the efficiency of the movement. On your ability to strike a balance between the movement itself, the generation of the muscular movements that are required and fuel utilization across the different sources of nerve muscle blood, heart and lungs. So let's ask the question, why would you fail on a long run? Why would you quit? Well, as you set out on that long run, assuming you have some glycogen in your liver and in your muscles, you're going to use that energy first, even if it's very low intensity. Okay, so we're not talking about sprinting. We're talking about heading out the door or starting off on a marathon. You're starting to assuming you have some conditioning or even if you don't, you're going to burn carbohydrate. You're going to burn glucose in the bloodstream. You're going to burn carbohydrate as those muscles contract. Those are what we call slow twitch muscles. They're contracting. They start burning up fuel to make ATP to continue to contract. Your mind is going to use more or less energy depending on how much will power, how much of a fight you have to get into with yourself in order to generate the effort. I really want to underscore this. If you're somebody that's thinking maybe I go for the run, maybe I don't go for the run, I'll do it at 2 o'clock, okay, 205. No, I only want to go on the half hour or maybe on the main hour. And you're going through all that guess what, you're burning up useful energy that you could use either for the run, for example, or for something else. When we think about something hard when we re-ruminate, when we persevere on an idea or on a decision, we are burning, neural energy and neural energy is glucose and epinephrine and all the things we talked about before. So, will power in part is the ability to devote resources to things and part of that is making decisions to just either do it or not do it. I'm not of the just do it mindset. I think there's a right time and a place to train, but I also think that it is not good. In other words, it utilizes excessive resources to turn over decisions excessively. And you probably burn as much cognitive energy deciding about whether or not to do a given training or not as you do in the actual training. Okay, so we'll talk more about how this long duration effort can relate to mental performance, but the long duration effort should be one set, 12 minutes or longer. It could go for 30 minutes or 60 minutes or an hour. We'll talk about programming later in the episode. This is going to be less than 100% of your maximum oxygen uptake, your heart rate is not going to be through the ceiling or maxed out, but it's all about efficiency of movement. That's what you're building. When you go out for a run that's 30 minutes, you are building the capacity to repeat that performance the next time while being more efficient, actually burning less fuel. And that might seem a little bit counterintuitive, but every time you do that, run what you're doing is you're building up mitochondrial density. It's not so much about mitochondrial oxidation and respiration. You're building up mitochondrial density. You're actually increasing the amount of ATP that you can create for a given bout of effort. You're becoming more efficient. Okay, you're burning less fuel overall doing the same thing. That's really what these long slow distance or long bouts of effort are really all about. Now, why do this long duration effort? Why would you want to do it? Why is it good for you? Well, it does something very important, which is that it builds the capillary beds within muscles. So let's talk a little bit about vascularity. We haven't done this too much yet, but if you have seen the episode on supercharging performance, we talked about AVAs, these arteriovanis, estamoses, where blood moves from arteries directly into veins, but that's unusual. That only takes place in this, so called, um, Glamorous skin of the palms, the face and the bottoms of the feet. Typically, for most all other areas of the body, what happens is arteries bring blood to a given tissue like a muscle. And veins return that blood back to the heart. There are exceptions, but in general, and in between arteries and veins are these little tiny, what are called capillary beds or microcapillary. So these are tiny little avenues like little tiny streams and estuaries between the bigger arteries and veins. Now, those are actually contained within muscle, and what's amazing is that you can increase the number of them. You can literally build new capillaries. You can create new little streams within your muscles. And the type of long duration effort that I was talking about before, 12 minutes or more of steady effort is very useful for doing that. And is very useful for increasing the mitochondria, the energy producing elements of the cells, the actual muscle cells. And the reason is when blood arrives to muscles, it has oxygen. The muscles are going to use some of that oxygen, and then some of the deoxygenated blood is going to be sent back to the heart and to the lungs. Now, the more capillaries that you build into those muscles, the more oxygen available to those muscles. I don't want to get too much into the physics of fluid flow, but basically it's the difference between taking a hose and sticking it into the muscles. And sticking it into some dirt just directly, like, and turning on the faucet at a given rate, the spigot rather, or having a bunch of little hoses, like a sprinkler system that go out and irrigate the whole yard. The irrigation is equivalent to this capillary bed system. And it's very good at using energy sources within blood. So the simple way to think about this is when you go out for a run, let's say it's the first run you've done for a while and you go out for 12 or 15 minutes, and somewhere right around 20 minutes, like that's it, I just can't continue. Well, when you come back the next time to do that run, you've built endurance largely because you've built these capillary beds. You've expanded these little streams in which blood can deliver oxygen to the muscles. And so it's going to feel relatively straightforward to either go a little bit quicker for the same duration, the same distance, or to extend that run for another five to 10 minutes. So this long duration work, unlike muscular endurance, like planks and everything that we were talking about before, is really about building the capillary systems and the mitochondria, the energy utilization systems within the muscles, themselves. And that's very important to understand. It's distinctly different than say building the neurons that fire the muscles. The neurons are already there. They're going to fire those muscles just fine. In fact, if your life dependent on it today, you could probably run a marathon. You probably get injured. It would be very psychologically and physically painful. I don't recommend you do that unless you're trained for it. But if you were to train properly for it, if you were to do long duration bouts of effort once or twice a week or three times a week, pretty soon it would become easy because you're building these vascular micro beds or micro vascular beds as they're called. Okay, so you're able to bring more energy to the muscles and they're able to utilize more energy. So that's long duration. So we've got muscular endurance and we've got long duration endurance. And then there are two kinds in between that in recent years have gotten a lot of attention and excitement, but most people are not distinguishing between these two kinds of endurance. And that's a shame because in failing to distinguish between the two kinds of what we call high intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval training, most people, perhaps you, are not getting nearly as much physical and mental benefit out of high intensity training as you could. So I want to talk about the two kinds of high intensity interval training and what each of them does for your brain and body and what sorts of adaptations they cause. Because in doing that you can really start to build up specific energy systems in your brain and body in ways that are best serve you for your cognitive work and for other sorts of things like strength and speed or hypertrophy or for running marathons for that matter. So there are two kinds of high intensity training for endurance, sometimes called high intensity interval training. One is anaerobic, so called anaerobic endurance, so no oxygen and the other is aerobic endurance, both of which qualify as HIT high intensity interval training. So let's talk about anaerobic endurance first. anaerobic endurance from a protocol perspective is going to be. 3 to 12 sets okay and these repetitions and I'll talk about what the repetitions are are going to be performed. At whatever speed allows you to complete the work in good safe form okay so it could be fast could be slow as the work continues your repetitions may slow down or it may speed up. Chainsaw it's going to slow down so what is this work what are these sets look like remember long slow distances one set. muscular endurance is 3 to 5 sets high intensity anaerobic endurance is going to be somewhere between 3 and 12 sets and it's going to have a ratio of work to rest of anywhere from 3 to 1 to 1 to 5. So what would a 3 to 1 ratio set look like well it's going to be 30 seconds of hard pedaling on the bike for instance or running or on the rower these are just examples it could be in the pool swimming it could be any number of things or air squats or you know or weighted squats if you will provided. You can manage that 30 seconds on 10 seconds off that's a very brief rest so 3 to 1 is just a good example would be 30 seconds on 10 seconds off. The opposite extreme on that ratio be 1 to 5 so 20 seconds on 100 seconds off so you do the work for 20 seconds then you rest 100 seconds. Now what's the difference what should you do 3 to 1 ratio so 30 seconds on 10 seconds off or should you do 1 to 5 20 seconds on to 100 seconds off. Well that will depend on whether or not the quality of the movement is important to you. So let's just take a look at the 3 to 1 ratio so in the 3 to 1 ratio if you're going to do 30 seconds of hard pedaling on a bike followed by 10 seconds maybe one of these what they call assault bikes. And then you stop for 10 seconds and then repeat chances are you will be able to do 1, 2, 3, 4 maybe even as many as 12 sets if you're really in good condition. That you'll be able to do all those because pedaling on the bike doesn't require a ton of skill and if you do it incorrectly if your elbow flares out a little bit or something it's very unlikely that you'll get injured unless it's really extreme. Okay, but the same movement done for instance with kettlebells so 30 seconds on 10 seconds off. The first set will probably be in good form the second one will be in pretty good form but let's say you're getting to the fifth and sixth set and you're going 30 seconds on 10 seconds off chances are. The quality of your repetitions will degrade significantly and you increase the probability that you're going to get injured or that you're going to damage yourself in some way or that you can't complete the movement or that some smaller muscles like your grip muscles might give out. So the quality of repetitions is going to drop considerably with the 3-to-1 approach. If you're just doing it for effort and we'll talk about what this builds in your system in a moment, that's fine. But for most people, if quality of form is important, so maybe this is using weights, maybe you're doing squats. So you're going to do 20 seconds on and 100 seconds of rest. Maybe it's even a barbell loaded squat, maybe you're doing kettlebells, maybe you've got some other resistance there that's allowing you to do this. What you'll find is that the longer rest, even though it's 20 seconds of intense effort, followed by a longer rest of about 100 seconds will allow you to perform more quality repetitions safely over time. So what is building anaerobic endurance look like? And then I'll tell you what is actually good for in the true practical sense. What anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like is that if you decided to do this for the first week, you might do this two or three times a week. Maybe even just once a week, depending on the other things you're doing, we'll talk about programming at the end. And you would generate just three sets. So it might be three sets of 20 seconds of hard effort followed by 100 seconds rest. Then you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds of effort, 100 seconds of rest, 100 seconds of rest, 100 seconds of rest, 100 seconds of rest, and you might do that twice a week. And then each week you're adding one or two sets. Okay. In doing that, you will build up what we call anaerobic endurance. What is anaerobic endurance? Well, let's ask why we fail. anaerobic endurance is going to be taking your system into greater than 100% of your VO2 max. It's going to be taking your heart rate up very high and it's going to maximize your oxygen utilization systems. That is going to have effects that are going to lead to fatigue at some point in the workout and that fatigue will trigger an adaptation. So let's ask what adaptation it's triggering. Well, it's triggering both mitochondrial respiration, the ability of your mitochondria to generate more energy by using more oxygen because you're bringing some your maxing out literally. You're getting above your VO2 max. You're hitting that threshold of how much oxygen you can use in your system. One of the adaptations will be that your mitochondria will shift such that they can use more oxygen. And you're going to also increase the capillary beds, but not as much as you're going to be able to increase the amount of neuron engagement of muscle. So normally when we start to hit fatigue when we're exhausted when we're breathing really hard because the systems of the body are linked and there's a mental component to this as well, a kind of motivational component. After that third or fourth or sixth set of 20 seconds on 100 seconds off or if you're at the other extreme 30 seconds on and 10 seconds off, there's going to be a component of you want to stop and by pushing through and repeating another set safely of course. What you're doing is you are training the neurons to be able to access more energy literally convert that into ATP and for the muscles, therefore, to access more energy and ATP and the adaptation is in the mitochondria's ability to use oxygen. And this has tremendous carryover effects for other types of exercise. So while I know and appreciate that people are using high intensity interval training of this kind or similar in order to just like burn fat. You know, do their workouts, quote unquote. It's very useful for building a capacity to engage in short bouts of effort repeatedly to really lock in. I don't want to use the word focus because it's not strictly mental focus, but to be able to generate short bouts of very intense work. This can be beneficial in competitive sports or team sports where there's a sprinting component where the field opens up and you need to dribble the ball down the field, for instance, in shoot on goal. Or where you're playing tennis and it's a long rally and then all of a sudden somebody really starts, you know, putting you back on your heels and you have to really make the maximum amount of effort to run to the net and to get the ball across that things of that sort. Okay. There are a variety of places where there's carryover from this type of training, but it does support endurance. It's about muscle endurance. It's about these muscles ability to generate a lot of force in the short term but repeatedly. Okay. So that's the way to conceptualize this and it is different than maximum power. Even though it feels like maximum effort, it is not the same as building power and speed into muscles. Those are distinctly different protocols. So the key elements again are that you're bringing your breathing and your oxygen utilization way up above your max. It's not quite hitting failure, but you're really pushing the system to the point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin another set. You're not necessarily psychologically ready. I'll talk more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this sort can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen to our lungs and other tissues. I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's happening at the level of the heart. But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol which is high intensity aerobic conditioning. So hit has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic and you just heard about anaerobic. High intensity aerobic conditioning also involves about three to twelve sets. Starting off of course with fewer sets as you're getting into this training and then extending into more sets as one parameter you could expand. Has again the same ratio of three to one, so thirty seconds on ten seconds off or one to five, twenty seconds on a hundred seconds off or a very powerful tool for building up aerobic conditioning is a one to one ratio. A one to one ratio is powerful for building on average. Most of the energy systems involving remember we had these nerve muscle blood heart and lungs. A one to one ratio might be you run a mile and however long that takes let's say it takes you six minutes or seven minutes then you rest for an equivalent amount of time. Then you repeat and then you rest for a equivalent amount of time so you might run first miles let's say seven minutes then you rest for seven minutes then you run a mile again and it might take eight minutes and you rest for eight minutes and you continue that for a total of four miles of work for four miles of running work I should say. Or seven miles of work you can build this up many people find that using this type of training allows them to do things like go run half marathons and marathons even though prior to the race date. They've never actually run a half marathon or marathon now that might seem incredible it's like how could it be that running a mile on and then and then resting for running a mile and then resting for an equivalent amount of time running a mile resting for equivalent amount of time for seven miles. It allows you to run continuously for 13 miles or for 26 miles. Well, I'm not discouraging people from ever doing the long duration endurance I think that is very important but it's because it builds up so many of these energy utilization systems it really teaches you to engage, excuse me, the nerve to muscle firing it improves. ATP and mitochondrial function in muscle it allows the blood to deliver more oxygen to the muscle and to your brain and I'll explain how that is and it allows your heart to deliver more oxygen overall and it builds a tremendous lung capacity and we will talk about exactly how to breathe and how to build lung capacity both first take of warming up and for performance. So what would this look like and when should you do this well it's really a question for these workouts of asking how much work can one do in eight to twelve minutes right and then rest and then repeat how much work can you do for eight to twelve minutes then rest and then repeat and how many times she do this well this is the sort of thing it's pretty intense and so you would probably only want to do this. Maybe three times a week if you're not doing many other things I will talk about how this program can be moved in with other forms of training but I'll just give you a little hint now it's very clear and it's described in the review article. Refer to and we will link another article as well that concurrent training doing strength training and the endurance training of any of the four kinds of them describing today. Can be done you can program those in the same week but you want to get for an ideally six or even better 24 hours between these workouts because it is very hard for instance to do a one to one. Myel repeats like we're run a mile rest for a cool in time run a mile rest for a equivalent time to do that two or three times a week and also do weight training before or do a long run afterwards that would quickly lead to breakdown for most people unless you have very very good energy utilization systems you're really kind of advanced or elite athlete and or. There I say you're using tools to enhance your performance at the level of blood or hormones and I'm actually going to talk about those at the end and why they work. So we have four kinds of endurance muscular endurance we have long duration endurance we have high intensity interval training of two kinds anaerobic and aerobic and this last type the aerobic. One works best it seems if you kind of do this one to one ratio so how would you use these and what are they actually doing. Let's talk about the heart and the lungs and oxygen because that's something that we can all benefit from understanding and. It will become very clear in that discussion why this type of training is very useful even for non athletes in order to improve oxygenation and energy utilization of the brain and the heart the brain and the heart are probably the two most important systems that you need to take care of in your life. Yes, your musculature needs to be maintained. If you want to build it that's up to you, but you should try and maintain your musculature but maintaining or enhancing brain function and cardiovascular function. It's absolutely clear our key for health and longevity in the short and long term and the sorts of training I talked about today has been shown again and again and again to be very useful for enhancing the strength of the mind. Yes, I'll talk about that as well as the health of the brain and the body. So let's talk about the sorts of adaptations that are happening in your brain and body that are so beneficial in these different forms of training. If you are breathing hard and your heart is beating hard, so this would be certainly in the high intensity and aerobic and aerobic conditioning because you're getting up near your VO2 max in high intensity aerobic conditioning and you're exceeding your VO2 max in high intensity and aerobic conditioning. What's going to happen is as of course your heartbeat's faster, your blood is going to be circulating faster in principle. Oxygen utilization in muscles is going to go up and over time not long, very quickly what will happen when those capillary beds start to expand. I'll talk about that. But in addition because of the amount of blood that's being returned to the heart when you engage in these really intense bouts of effort repeatedly, the amount of blood being returned to the heart actually causes an eccentric loading of one of the muscular walls of the heart. It is muscle, it's cardiac muscle, we have skeletal muscle attached to our bones and we have cardiac muscle which is our heart. When more blood is being returned to the heart because of the additional work that your muscles and nerves are doing, it actually has the effect of creating an eccentric loading, a kind of pushing of the wall, the left, I realize I'm not using the strict anatomy here, but I don't want to get into all the features of the structural features of the heart. But the left ventricle essentially getting slammed back and then having to push back in a kind of eccentric loading of the cardiac muscle and the muscle thickens. But not because the heart thickens overall, it's actually a strengthening of the cardiac muscle in a way that increases what we call stroke volume. Meaning as more blood is returned to the heart, there's an adaptation where the heart muscle actually gets stronger and therefore can pump more blood per stroke per beat. And as it does that, it delivers because blood contains glucose and oxygen and other things. It delivers more fuel to your muscles which allows you to do yet more work per unit time. So when we hear that, oh, you know, someone so has a, or maybe you have a nice low heart rate that you know, maybe you're one of these really extreme folks like 30 or 40 beats per minute, although most people are sitting at 50, 60, 70, 80 that's your resting heart rate. If you exercise regularly and you do long duration aerobic work, your heart rate will start to go down your resting heart rate. It will increase the stroke volume of your heart. If you do this high intensity type training where your heart is beating very hard, so maybe the one to one ratio mile run repeats that I described a minute ago. So you do that twice a week for three or four, and I said it could go all the way up to 12 sets, which is a lot. I don't recommend people start there. Pretty soon, the stroke volume of your heart will really increase. And as a consequence, you can deliver more fuel to your muscles and to your brain. And you will notice that you can do more work, meaning you can do the same work you were doing a few days or weeks ago with relative ease. Your cognitive functioning will improve. This has been shown again and again because there's an increase in vasculature, literally capillary beds within the brain, the hippocampus areas that support memory. But also areas of the brain that support respiration that support focus that support effort. This isn't often discussed, but the ability to deliver more blood and therefore more glucose, remember neurons run on glucose and oxygen to the brain is a big feature of why exercise of the kind of describing helps with brain function. Now weight training does have some positive effects on brain function. Also, when I say weight training, I'm really, I should be more specific. I really am referring to strength and hypertrophy training. Straighten hypertrophy training, especially if it's of the sort where you get into the burn as we talked about last episode and you start generating lactate as a hormonal signal that can benefit your brain, etc. It can have positive effects on the brain. And frankly, there haven't been as many studies of resistance training, strengthen hypertrophy training on brain function, mainly because most of those experiments are done in mice or primates, nonhuman primates. I should say, and it's hard to get mice to do resistance training. It's hard to get humans to do resistance training. It's definitely hard to get mice to do resistance training. There are ways to do it, but it's hard to get them to do say, you know, three sets of eight on the deadlift and then do some curls and then do some chin-ups and this kind of thing. It's pretty easy to get a mouse to run on a treadmill and you can set the tension on that treadmill to make it so that it's easier or harder for the mouse to turn that wheel. So that's one of the reasons. However, it's very clear and you should now understand intuitively why the kind of standards strength and hypertrophy type workouts are not going to activate the blood oxygenation and the stroke volume increases for the heart that the sorts of training I'm talking about today will. It just doesn't have the same positive effects. Now, that isn't to say that if you just wait trained that you'll be dumb or that you'll lose your memory over time, you might, but it is to say that endurance work, in particular the high intensity and long duration work that I've talked about today, the two high intensity protocols and the long duration work has been shown again and again and again to have positive effects on brain function. Not through the addition of new neurons, sorry to break it to you, but that's not a major event in the exercise to or non-exercised human brain. For reasons we can talk about in a future episode, but it still has many positive effects through the delivery of things like IGF1, but also just through plain oxygenation of the brain and the way it promotes the development of micro-vascular church to to listen to deliver neurons more nutrients. If neurons don't get oxygen and glucose, they do die unless there's another fuel source like ketones which can replace the glucose. If you don't give oxygen to neurons, if you don't deliver enough to them, you get what's called ischemia, you get little micro strokes. So the type of exercise I'm talking about today in generating intense heart rate increases, provided that's safe for you to do, breathing hard. That's going to deliver oxygen and blood, increase stroke volume of the heart and is going to improve brain function. This has been supported by many, many quality peer reviewed studies. So that's one form of positive adaptation. I also talked about just sort of performance adaptations. How doing high-intensity aerobic conditioning of the, you know, mild repeats type training can actually improve your ability to do long bouts of intense work. It also seems like it dovetails or is compatible with resistance training that's aimed towards strength and hypertrophy. Now in full disclosure, the data seem to indicate that if people just wait train or train for strength. So three reps, rest five minutes, three reps of heavy weights, et cetera. Yeah, you'll get much stronger than you would. If you're doing things like, you know, five repetitions up to 12 or 12 to 25 reps and you're, you know, and you're going out for long jogs. There's always going to be a compromise in adaptations, unfortunately. It does seem like you can do concurrent training as I mentioned before. If you allow anywhere from four to six or ideally 24 hours between workouts. As I mentioned in the previous episode, if you want to know if you are recovered from a workout, a great way to do that is to apply to carbon dioxide tolerance test, which is four breaths in and out inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale then a big inhale and then a slow controlled exhale. If that slow controlled exhale is 60 seconds or longer, it means that your parasympathetic, your calming nervous system is under your control and it's likely, I should say likely that, you know, and this is a very specific, your whole nervous system has recovered from whatever it is that you've been doing and experiencing and life including work and relationships. If not, you might want to take a rest day there, I say, or, Clostella is on is what he's 10 now. I think he's on his 12,000th rest day. Most people need, I should say, one to two full rest days per week. I know there are people going to say that's ridiculous and, okay, maybe you have, amazing recovery abilities, also depends on training intensity. Many people benefit from having one or two full rest days per week, at least one. Some people don't need to, but if you are not able to extend that exhale on the carbon diet, dioxide tolerance test, past 60 seconds or so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds, chances are you're so called sympathetic nervous system. Your stress system is chronically elevated and you're not really putting the break on that system enough, and that's a subconscious thing. There are ways that you can accelerate recovery, but I would encourage you to listen to the previous episode. It's time stamped for how to assess recovery. So how often to program these things will depend on the other things you're doing. I think it's perfectly reasonable to do this type of training with other types of training. And I'll talk about a variety of combinations of those toward the end of the episode. I do want to talk about how to deliver more energy and oxygen. These are tools that are extremely useful. I believe and that are grounded in physiology. The three things I'd like to talk about are how to breathe, what to do immediately after training and hydration. And I promise I will get back into programming and sort of protocols, but these are vitally important to your ability to perform endurance work in particular. And they are grounded in how neurons and blood and oxygen and your heart work together. So let's first talk about breathing or respiration. We breathe a couple of different ways, but let's just remind ourselves why we breathe. We breathe to bring oxygen in our system. And we breathe to get rid of carbon dioxide. And we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work. It's not that oxygen is good and carbon dioxide is bad. They have to be present in the appropriate ratios. So one thing that is very clear is our ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles enter our brain is going to be important for our ability to generate muscular effort, especially of the kind of it was talking about today, but also weight training and other forms of skill based effort, et cetera. And our ability to think. If you're holding your breath for too long, if you're breathing too much, if you're what they call over breathing or under breathing, if you're shallow breathing, if you're mouth breathing, these are all things that can really impede mental and physical performance. So let's make it really simple. And then I promise to do a few sure episode all about respiration. There are two main sources of air for your body and it's air coming in through your nose and air coming in through your mouth. In general, nasal breathing is better. It scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses. You have a microbiome in your nose that benefits. There are a number of reasons. It's also just a more efficient system, believe it or not, even though it feels like you can go more air with your mouth, getting good at nasal breathing is useful. A gear system of the type that Brian McKenzie and colleagues have developed, I think, is a good way to conceptualize this. If you're doing long duration work, trying to do it all nasal breathing. If you have deviated septum, it's probably because you don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth breathing is something that, you know, many people suffer from it. You're more prone to infections. It's not as efficient, et cetera. There is a place for mouth breathing. However, it's usually if you need to do a strong exhale, oftentimes you can discard more volume through the mouth, unless you're very trained at nasal breathing. So if you're doing high intensity training, a good way to conceptualize this is to exhale on the max effort and then to inhale on the less intense part. So that might be as you're generating the movement, you know, in the concentric part of the movement, you exhale, right? Just like on a bat swing or something like that, or, you know, fighters and martial artists do this differently depending on how they were trained and the different purposes, but the kind of like, or the kind of exhaling during the effort and then inhaling on the portion of the repetition that is not the highest effort portion. Usually that's the eccentric phase of anything involving weights or rowing and things like that sort. So nasal breathing is great, but as you increase the intensity of your endurance work, you will need to incorporate the mouth. So a gear system would look something like first gear would be just nasal breathing, or second gear would also be just nasal breathing, but with more effort, third gear, again, power speed endurance has a lot more about this. You can go to their website. I think it's a very intelligent way to conceptualize this. As you go into more max effort, then you're going to, you know, third and fourth and fifth gear and at some point, you're not thinking about nose or mouth. You're just trying to hang on for dear life and complete the work safely. And that means breathe through whatever orifice works for you. So that's one aspect nose versus mouth. The other aspect is whether or not you're using your ribs, the intercostal muscles are these muscles that the Bruce Lee had these, you know, remarkable intercostal muscles that allow you to lift the rib cage or the diaphragm, which is a skeletal muscle that sits below the lungs. Just to remind you, when you inhale the diaphragm moves down, when you exhale the diaphragm moves up. Okay. Here's something that most people don't do and would benefit tremendously from. And I can say this because Andy Galpins lab has done work on this, exploring how warming up the intercostals and the nerve to diaphragm pathways before any kind of endurance work, or in the first few minutes of endurance work can allow you to breathe more deeply and to deliver more oxygen to the blood and excuse me, end to the muscles and to be able to do more work more efficiently. So what that involves is sometimes sitting, sometimes standing and just really concentrating on two things. We always hear about how we should diaphragmatic breathe and that means our belly moves out when we inhale. So our stomach expands, but also expanding the intercostals, which means actually raising the ribs, chest breathing. We're all told that in yoga class, don't breathe with your chest this. But actually that is warming up the intercostal muscles. So this is also a great way to generate adrenaline if you do it a little bit intensely. So let's say you're feeling unmotivated to train. I don't particularly like doing endurance training until I'm actually doing it. So I use and benefit from having a practice while I'll just sit there and for about three minutes, I'll just breathe very deeply, trying to raise my chest as much as I can for maybe a minute and then expanding, contracting my diaphragm and expanding my stomach outward when I inhale. By the end of that, you're actually delivering more oxygen to your system. My lab has looked at this in a totally different context and these lab has looked at in the context of physical performance. So warming up the breathing muscles should make sense given that you now know that muscles and neurons need glucose and they need oxygen in order to function. And so that's a great warmup. You can also do this while walking or while getting on the bike and starting to pedal, really starting to think about warming up the breathing system. And then you can decide if you want to do pure nasal or a combination of nasal and mouth breathing and so on. So that's something that we don't often hear about. The other one, the other tool rather that I talked about in a previous episode, I'll just mention again, is some people when they do endurance type work, they get a stitch in their side. They feel like they've got a side cramp. Very rarely is it actually a skeletal muscular cramp. It's oftentimes it's a referenced pain of the frenic nerve that innervates the liver. So the frenic nerve is responsible for the movement of the diaphragm. It is a very important system, but it has a number of what we call collateral. So it branches to other organs, runs over other organs. Sometimes when we're breathing shallow and we are in physical motion and we're engaging in physical effort, we'll feel that side stitch. When we think, oh, I've got a cramp or maybe I'm dehydrated or maybe I need to run with my hands over my head. My head, excuse me, typically you can relieve that side cramp, which isn't a cramp at all. That side stitch by doing the double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. And then sneaking a little bit more air in. That's a double kind of firing or what we call volume action potentials sent from the frenic nerve to the diaphragm, which will also activate that collateral, that branch, literally of the nerve that innervates the liver. And then when you exhale, you offload a bunch of carbon dioxide, but if you repeat that a few times, often, for me, every time, but often what will happen is that side stitch will just naturally disappear. It just means you're not breathing properly. The frenic nerve is firing in a way that's kind of aggravating that referenced pain. There's nothing kind of voodoo or mysterious about this. This just has to do with the way that the different nerves travel in the body. So as you set out on your run or maybe you're going to do some muscular endurance work or high intensity work, warming up the intercostals, warming up the diaphragm is good. And there are exercises that there is work that you can do to strengthen the intercostals and to strengthen the diaphragm during bouts of this kind of effort. And I would say that one of the ways that you can do that best is by really focusing on getting the maximum diaphragmatic expansion and chest lifting what we're all told now, not to do. Don't, don't chest breathe, belly breathe. The intercostals are there for a reason and they are perfectly good at filling your lungs. They work best when they collaborate with your diaphragm. When you are starting to fatigue to start to really inhale deeply and try to really expand those to deliver more oxygen to your system. While we're talking about delivering more oxygen to your system, I want to share with you a useful tool that will now make total sense mechanistically why it works, which is, oftentimes when we are on a long run or in long duration bouts of effort, we will hit the so-called wall. We will bonk, I think they used to call it or maybe they still call it that costilum. He needs to sleep. We bonk, we just we think, no, we can't continue. It's a curious thing as to whether or not that's neural or whether or not it's fuel based. There is certainly going to be a psychological or motivational component. But one way that you can reveal this kind of extra gear or the capacity to push on is by understanding the way that different muscle fibers use energy differently. Remember the fast twitch, phosphor creatine system and the slow twitch system that relies mainly on lipids and glucose. Okay, well even if you don't remember all that, if you've been running steadily for a long time and you're starting to fatigue and you feel like it's time to quit, you may have not tapped into an alternative fuel source. One thing that you can do is you can actually increase your speed. This is also true of work where you're doing repetitions with kettlebells or something. You can start to increase your speed. So run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster, not all out sprint. But in doing that, you're shifting the muscles and the nerves over towards utilizing a separate fuel source or a distinct fuel source. Maybe the phosphor creatine system if it's a quick bout of intense acceleration or maybe it's a combination of lipids and carbohydrates in your system that weren't available to you prior. Now of course, if you completely deplete your liver glycogen, you completely deplete everything you're only going to be running on stored fuel and fats and eventually you'll start metabolizing protein muscles themselves. But this is a kind of a unique way to realize that, oh, you weren't out of energy at all, you were just over relying on one fuel source. This is the reason why especially elite athletes are starting to both rely on carbohydrates so they're doing the whole carb depletion and carb loading. They're loading up their liver and their muscles with plenty of glycogen by eating pulses and rice and stuff before races. But they are also ingesting ketones during races, during long bouts of effort because ketones can be a quick form of energy. There's no reason why you can't use ketones if they are taken, exogenous ketones and carbohydrate and the incommetion. Remember, the body is accustomed to using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids, carbohydrates, all these things. It's only in the kind of internet age that we think in terms of, oh, you're either keto or you're burning sugar or you're fat adapted or fat fasting or fat fatting or fat fatting, gustella woke up when I said fat fatting. I'm not talking about you, gustella. So the point is that your body is used to using multiple fuel sources. So if you're kind of hitting that wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow you to tap into a new fuel source or combination of fuel sources just based on the way that muscles use fuel. So that's another tool. The other thing that's really important to think about in terms of endurance type work is hydration and I think hydration is important for all forms of physical work and exercise, not just endurance. The deal with hydration is that we've been taught about hydration all wrong, but let's remember what neurons work on. What are they used in order to fire? Well, they certainly need water, right? We need water in our system, I should say, but they remember they use electrolytes, sodium potassium to generate those action potentials to actually get neurons to contract, to be able to, excuse me, muscles to contract and for our brain to function and to be able to think. Typically, we're going to lose anywhere from one to five pounds of water per hour of exercise. And that's going to vary tremendously. It's going to vary on weather. It's going to vary on intensity, probably more like five pounds. If it's hot day and you're exercising very intensely. About one to five pounds per hour. Now, you know how much you weigh. So if you think about your weight in pounds, once you lose about one to four percent of your body weight in water, you're going to experience about a 20 to 30 percent reduction in work capacity and your ability to generate effort of any kind, strength, endurance, etc. Or also going to experience a significant drop in your ability to think and perform mental operations. So hydration is key. Now many people have been told, well, if you urinate and your urine is clear, well, then you're hydrated enough. Sometimes that's true. Sometimes that's not true. Also, and this is a topic I enjoyed discussing, but urine is a biological phenomenon. It's actually filtered blood. What did everyone so well? If there's a kid and it's a family friend, I'll say, did you know that your P is actually filtered blood and they usually kind of go wide out? But then they go, oh, that's kind of cool. Like kids have this natural curiosity about blood and P and stuff that's not contaminated by our preconceived notions of those things being gross. Because urine being filtered blood can give you some indication as to whether or not you're hydrated enough or not. And in order to really assess that, it's not going to be sufficient to urinate into another volume of water and assess whether or not your urine is very dark or very light. It actually requires urinating into a small volume and saying, well, is it darker or lighter than before? It's not something you really want to do most places. The etiquette of most gyms and environments is not suitable for that. But one of the things that you can just do is you can figure, well, I'm going to lose one to five pounds of water per hour. You can show up to exercise reasonably hydrated with electrolytes. So potassium, sodium, and magnesium are really key. Yes, it's true. You can die from drinking too much water in particular because it forces you. If you drink too much water, you'll excrete too many electrolytes and your brain will shut off. You'll actually, your heart will stop functioning properly. So you don't want to over consume water to the extreme either. But there are a number of equations that go into figuring out how much water you need based on how intense you're training, et cetera, a body size, et cetera. Just remember, you lose, excuse me, about one to five pounds of water per hour depending on how hot it is and how intensely you're exercising. Once your body weight drops by one to four percent, so you can just figure it well. If you lose five pounds per hour, you exercise for two hours. Let's say you're about 200 pounds. That's about 10 percent. Okay? Well, you want to replace that before very quickly or not, you want to replace that all along before you start experiencing this massive 20 to 30 percent reduction in work capacity of muscles in the brain. A simple formula, what I call the galpent equation here after referred to as the galpent equation is a formula that gets you close to the exact amount that you would want that doctor Andy Galpent came up with, which is your body weight in pounds divided by the number 30. And that is how many ounces you should drink for every 15 minutes of exercise. But once again, the galpent equation, your body weight in pounds divided by 30, that's the amount of fluid to drink in ounces, every 15 minutes of exercise. Now, if you're sweating a lot, you may need more. Okay? If you're already very well hydrated, you may need less. But that's a good rule of thumb to begin and to start to understand the relationship between hydration and performance. There is a phenomenon in which gastric emptying, the ability to move stuff out of your gut, including water and electrolytes out of your gut and into the bloodstream and for delivery to the tissues of your body for effort, is hindered when you get above 70 percent of your VO2 max. In other words, when you're doing high intensity training, sometimes people experience that ingesting water during intense training is difficult. It is something that can be actually trained up. It's a matter of learning to kind of relax the your abdominal muscles and there's some other aspects of adaptation that will allow you to drink during higher intensity work. As Galpent says, don't try and ingest fluids when you're working out or competing at higher than 70 percent of VO2 max if you've never done it before. You want to train up this capacity. People can learn how to consume fluids during a race or consume fluids during ballots of exercise that are very intense. And a lot of people don't want to do that because they don't want to have to stop to urinate et cetera. But given the crucial role of hydration for muscular performance and for brain performance, it seems that if you're going to be doing a lot of high-intensity interval training of the various kinds that I talked about today or high-intensity training of any kind that hydration is key and learning or in other words getting your system to adapt to ingesting fluids in the middle of these workouts is something that seems beneficial at least to me in terms of the trade-off between being dehydrated and the somewhat discomfort of maybe drinking some fluid. So you sip small amounts of fluid initially and then you're able to take bigger and bigger gulps as time goes on and pretty soon you're able to drink midset or be excuse me, not midset. Please don't do that between sets and you work out or while you're still breathing hard after a mild repeat or something that's of that sort without much disruption or any at all to your performance. Last episode we talked about how to assess recovery and things that you might want to do to improve recovery, how exposure to ice baths and cold showers can reduce inflammation which can be great for recovery, but can inhibit some of the adaptations for strength and hypertrophy because inflammation isn't good or bad. inflammation isn't like a nice person or a mean person. It's both. It's a great thing for stimulating adaptations, but you don't want it around too long and so we suggest that you not do ice baths within probably six hours of any training where the goal was hypertrophy or strength training. There is some evidence that getting yourself into an ice bath or cold shower after endurance training can actually improve the mitochondrial aspects of endurance exercise that you can get improvements in mitochondrial density and you can get improvements in mitochondrial respiration by doing that afterwards and that it can facilitate recovery. That's still a bit of a controversial area. I do think that what I mentioned earlier that waiting at least six hours and probably more like 24 hours between workouts is a good idea that getting at least one full day of rest each week for some people that will be too. I have to say I'm one of these people that after two days of absolutely no exercise. I do perform better consistently across all aspects of physical performance and mentally I feel better as well even though I load to take those days off unless I'm really exhausted. It does seem to help my training. Some people can train seven days a week and they're fine. I think it just is there's a lot of individual variation. You want to work on sleep and maximizing sleep for recovery, nutrition of course as well. I talked about sleep in the first four episodes of the podcast. If you have trouble with sleep definitely check out those episodes. It's very clear and a number of sports teams even some folks that I work with and he galpe in and others are starting to incorporate a what's called a parasimpathetic down regulation after training of any kind as a way to accelerate recovery and enable you to do more work in other words get back to workout sooner. What is parasimpathetic down regulation? It means finishing your training and instead of just hopping on the phone or hopping into your car and heading off to take five minutes minimum maybe ideally more like 10 or 20 but for sake of time five minutes minimum and doing just some slow pure nasal long exhale devoted breathing or lying down and just kind of zoning out. That it seems can accelerate recovery and allow you to get back into other types of work mental work or physical work more quickly which makes total sense because remember your nervous system and recovery and work is a local phenomenon which muscles were using. You know we're using your your glutes your hands and your and your back or we're using your shoulders etc but it's also a systemic thing. It's also about those neurons in the locus serrulious that are releasing up an effort. You want to quiet all that down after training. You want to really just zone out think costilow channel your inner costilow and just mellow out for five to 20 minutes and then move into the rest of your day. Five minutes should be manageable even if it's just sitting in the car with your eyes closed doing that down regulation breathing. I think you'll see big benefits in terms of allowing yourself to come back sooner do more work over time. I just perform and feel better generally as well as be able to think about other things besides the just how much the previous workout and a beach up. A couple more things I think you're going to be useful and I do want to just pack these in because we are closing out the month on physical performance and that's about programming and about pacing and the kind of mental aspects of endurance. So let's start with pacing and mental aspects of endurance. I learned from a friend in colleague here at the podcast that who's very active in triathlon in marathon and other knows a lot about that whole world and the competitive landscape there that pacing and literally physical paces of a laser on the ground or visualizing or having a pace car or a pace runner in front is actually not allowed in many competitions. And if those are present doesn't allow the race times to qualify as legitimate record holding times and that's very interesting to me because what we know is that the visual system has this capacity to switch back and forth between what we call panoramic vision where we're not really focused on anything. Things are just flowing past us or our eyes are just kind of zoned out. So I can do this right now and you won't be able to tell but I'm looking at the corners of the room. I see Costello down there on the floor. I see my podcast team here and I can also see the microphone. I can see myself in this environment. That's panoramic vision. Whereas if I draw my eyes to one location like right there in the center of the camera, it's what's called a virgin's eye movement. So I'm contracting my visual window. The contraction of the visual window when that's done is the same thing that would happen if I was tracking say a pace car or a pace runner or a laser on the ground. The mirror bringing our eyes together to what we call a virgin's point has the impact of triggering the activation of neural circuits in the thalamus. Things like Zona and Serta if you really want to know what their names are of these brain areas as well as in the brainstem that activate the so-called alertness system things like locusts seruleus whereas panoramic vision tends to bring us into states of relaxation. You can actually leverage this during your runs. Let's say you're out for a long run or you're swimming or you're cycling. This is probably easiest to imagine out of the water. Be probably doing the water as well. If you focus your attention on a landmark that you're going to run to, you'll find that it's much easier than if you don't actually have a set milestone or landmark that you're going to run to. However, if you were to continue that repeatedly just going milestone after milestone, after milestone, you would feel more mentally fatigued and you would actually be able to degenerate less work overall. One thing that can be useful is focusing on a milestone running to that milestone or biking whatever it is the activity happens to be and then dilating your field of view to relax the system and then continuing again. So it's this kind of active contraction or of the visual window and then dilation of the visual window. Contraction of the visual window allows you to generate more effort but there's a cost to doing that because neurons consume energy and now you know how they do that. Whereas dilation allows you to essentially be more efficient. Now pacing is not allowed or having a pace or a visual pace or because it does allow you to access systems in the brain and body that allow you to create more energy more effort. And so I find it interesting that I think in a kind of subconscious genius the race officials and the the governing bodies of these of these races have said, okay, sure having a pace or there or someone in front you can draft off of them. There's actually a kind of a aerodynamic effect of having someone in front of you that makes it easier to run in the wake of their of their air stream so to speak. Same as true in cycling. This is why the cycling teams are so good at maneuvering and packs and very specific ways you can go faster with less effort if you're drafting as it's called behind somebody. But as well where you place your vision will allow you to generate more effort. And so it's interesting that they've taken out this kind of uh, if you will, performance enhancing tool, I imagine and I have to imagine. It's the appropriate word here that good runners, good cyclists have the ability to create a kind of pace or in their minds. I have to imagine that they're not just completely allowing their attention to drift. Although they do that when they want to be in highly efficient mode, generating effort without having to tax their mental capacity and remember mental capacity is neural energy and consumes glucose energy that they could devote to the function of their body. But that when needed that they can focus their energy in and actually kind of chase a mental pace or pick milestone. So this is a mental game that you can play as well. It's a little bit hard to do in the context of weightlifting in the gym. It's more of a moving through space kind of thing. But some people do this by counting reps. Etc. I think it's especially suitable for endurance type of exercise, especially done outside. One of the reasons I hate running on a treadmill is it just feels like it's never ending. And I've never tried one of these Peloton things. I try to avoid looking at screens as much as I possibly can. But if you try this next time you're out for a runner, swim what you'll find is that you have a capacity to engage a system of higher energy output when you focus your eyes on a particular location. But you want to use that judiciously because your goal of course is to become efficient at moving through space over time and not taxing your brain and body to the point where you arrive at the end of that unless it's race day just completely tapped out. So that's a kind of interesting aspect of running. If you're a fan of running, which I am and you get the chance to look at any of the documentaries or Dr. Drama's made about, excuse me, about Steve Prefontaine, it was clear that he was mostly in a battle with himself, but that he was also a highly competitive individual. And you'll see this in some of his races. I do encourage you to look some of those up on on YouTube or see the Dr. Drama as they're quite good where he ran the essentially was 12 laps on a track. It's essentially the five, it is the five thousand meter race, which essentially three miles and he was essentially trying to sprint the whole thing, which is ridiculous. Actually knowing what you know today, you'll realize that Steve Prefontaine basically was pulling from strength, speed, power, muscular endurance, long duration, ever high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic, because you sort of try to maximize every fuel system and you'll see that in the the races that he runs, but that when runners are nearing the final laps, the so-called bell lap of a race, they'll often look to one another to see where somebody is, obviously, to assess their progress and how close somebody is. But when somebody gets passed, oftentimes you'll see someone access this mysterious kick, this ability to tap into some additional gear that allows them to run forward or faster when they themselves actually thought that they were maxed out. So someone could be running for the finish line. Their convinced they're going to win, they're going max effort, at least they perceive max effort. Someone passes them and all of a sudden max effort has changed because of that visual target they are able to access higher levels of speed and output and effort in performance. They don't always catch up to that person and win, but having a target, a milestone is a powerful way that we can generate more force and energy in anything and the visual system is the way that we bring those milestones into our brain which then brings about epinephrine which brings about neurofiring which allows us to access whatever resources happen to be available to us. So I find this fascinating because people often wonder like where it is the kick come from, where is this kind of gift of an additional gear, where is that deeper resource? And we often express it and talk about it in kind of psychological terms like heart or willpower or that something kind of got transplanted into us or descended into us and not to remove any of the spiritual aspects of of sport or running or effort or the human heart. But it's very clear that the nervous system when it has a specific visual target can generate the sort of intense effort that it couldn't otherwise and it sometimes even comes as a surprise to the person generating the effort. I promise that I would talk about programming, meaning when and how many times a week to do the various workouts related to endurance and how to merge those with other types of exercise that you might be doing for strength or yoga or other things that you might be doing like work and other things unrelated to exercise. Since that's a vast space with many different parameters and you all have different lives and lifestyles and backgrounds with fitness, etc. What I'm going to do is I'm going to put three different levels if you will or protocols that one could adopt in a link on the show notes. So in the caption on YouTube, if you click on that link you'll be able to see three possible combinations of endurance work, strength and hypertrophy work or endurance work, flexibility and hypertrophy work that are grounded in many of the major publications that Dr. Andy Galpin and colleagues and other people have described including this review that's also linked there on concurrent training and how one can use concurrent training, meaning training for endurance, training for strength, training for hypertrophy, training for all these different things without having to train constantly every day twice a day, etc. So if you are interested in taking the protocols that you learned about in this episode and in previous episodes and combining those, we've placed them there for you as a completely zero cost resource. Please understand, they are not holy, not hostile or agrees, they are not holy, there will be variation in terms of what people can tolerate and what they have time for, but I think they'll serve as a useful guideline in getting started or in continuing with and expanding on existing endurance work, strength work, hypertrophy work and so forth. Just really quickly, we didn't talk about supplements much today. In the previous episodes, I talked about the phosphocreatin system and supplementing with creatine, talked about beta alanine for kind of moderate duration work. You know, really the only things that have been shown to really improve endurance work across the four varieties of endurance work I described today, they have essentially two forms one are stimulants, so things like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work and power output. There's a little bit of evidence that caffeine intake can actually inhibit the function of the creatine system, but it's just one study. But that's interesting. If you want to read that study, you can put caffeine into examin.com and it will take you to that study. Many people get sore after workouts in particular, workouts that involve a lot of eccentric loading, or workouts that are very novel where they've kind of pushed it instead of moving gradually as I suggest into say high-intensity anaerobic endurance work of three sets of 20 seconds on 100 second rest, maybe you get over ambitious and you do eight sets in which case you're extremely sore. Certain forms of magnesium in particular magnesium malate, MAL-ATE have been shown to be useful for removing or reducing the amount of delayed onset muscle soreness. That form of magnesium is distinctly different than the sorts of magnesium that are good for getting us into sleep, things like magnesium, 3-8, and by glycinate. Then there's this whole thing about beet powder and beet juices and things that increase nitric oxide and allow for more vasodilation and therefore delivery of blood to muscle and neurons and other tissues for long-boughts of endurance work. Some people like beet juice and the related compounds that increase arginine and vasodilation, some people don't. Some people don't feel good when they take those. Some people also don't feel good when they take beta alanine because it can give them this feeling of like itchy, creepy, call crawlies under the skin, the nious phenomenon, the nious and flush. Some people don't mind that or some people don't experience that. So when it comes to supplementation there's a lot of variety, but magnesium malate has been shown to reduce soreness to sometimes that's good, cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness things to that sort. But in general, we focused mainly today on behavioral tools. You'll notice that all of the tools are accessible without the need for lots of equipment. So I didn't say you need a roar or you need a kettlebell, though those will work. And I hope I was able to illustrate for you that endurance isn't just one thing. It's not just the ability to go for long bouts of exercise of different kinds that there's also this mental component because of the way that neurons work. And also that there are these different forms of endurance, of muscular endurance that where you're going to fail because of the muscles and muscle energy utilization and the nerves that innovate those muscles locally, not because of a failure to bring in oxygen or blood. Whereas long duration effort, it's going to be more about, you know, being below your VO2 max and your ability to be efficient for long bouts of more than 12 minutes of exercise. One set, as I say, of 12 minutes to maybe several hours. I should just mention you with long duration type work. You know, you could even imagine raking in the yard or mowing a lawn depending on how big that lawn is. I used to have a job when I was a kid mowing lawns and that I'll tell you. We didn't have many neighbors with very big lawns, but there are few of them fell huge because they were really convoluted. And if you're pushing that mower and these were the old fashioned mowers, not electric mowers, it's work. That's also of the sort that we call long duration endurance work. High intensity training will tap into yet other fuel sources and mechanisms as we learn today.

vid00017," Welcome to the Human Lab podcast, where we discuss science, science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and reach your health goals. I've long been a fan of getting blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the things that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. And now, with the advent of modern DNA tests, we can also get inside into things like metabolic factors that tell us whether or not we metabolize caffeine well or certain proteins well. What our fat metabolism genes are like. Things of that sort can only be analyzed from quality blood and DNA tests. In addition, many of the factors that impact our hormones, our metabolism, our brain health, those come back in a blood and DNA test and there are many blood and DNA tests out there, but within side tracker, they give you a lot of clear insight into what those markers mean and how to adjust them. They have this terrific platform that doesn't just give you the numbers back and tell you if you're higher low in some factor, but rather it tells you what your levels are of all those factors and gives you very simple and clear directives of changes you might make in your diet. Change that you might make in your exercise regimen or sleep, etc. In order to get those markers where they ought to be and where you would like them to be in order to optimize yourself. So they make everything very easy start to finish. They can even come to your home to take the blood and DNA tests if you like. If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman. And if you do that, you'll get 25% off any of inside trackers plans. Use the code Huberman at checkout. Today's podcast is also brought to us by Bell Campo Meat Company. Bell Campo is a regenerative farm in northern California that raises organic grass fed and finished certified humane meats. While I don't need a lot of meat, when I do, I insist that that meat be a very high quality. How the animals were cared for is extremely important to me and the life that the animal had and what it consumed is very important to me. So the way that I eat, I've discussed on this podcast before, but very briefly, I basically fast until about noon, then I eat a piece of beef or chicken with lunch and a salad. So that's basically my lunch. That's what optimizes my levels of alertness for work throughout the day. Then in the evening, I shift over to eating primarily carbohydrates. That's what allows me to sleep very well. So I'm not eating huge volumes of meat, but I am eating meat every day. Conventionally raised animals are confined to feed lots and need a diet of inflammatory grains, which is bad for them and it's bad for us when we eat their meat. Bell Campo's animals graze on open pastures and seasonal grasses, resulting in meat that is higher nutrients and healthy fats. And I've talked before about the importance of omega-3 fatty acids for both brain and body health. And Bell Campo meats are high in omega-3 fatty acids. The way Bell Campo raises its animals isn't just better for your health. It also has a positive impact on the environment. It's what's called climate positive and carbon negative, which means good for the planet and good for us. My favorite meats from Bell Campo are the rib eye and the flank steaks. That's typically what I eat. I think I'd probably eat about three or four of those across the weekend, and then I'll eat chicken on some other days. They're really delicious, and as I mentioned, they're very good for us. You can order Bell Campo sustainably raise meats to be delivered straight to your door using my code, Huberman at Bell Campo.com slash Huberman. If you do that, you'll get 20% off first time order. That's Bell Campo.com slash Huberman for 20% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation act backed by 25 published studies and has over 600,000 five star reviews. So I've been meditating on and off since I was about 15, 16 years old, mostly off at first. What I've found is that I'll sometimes start a meditation practice, but it's very hard to stay with. And then a few years ago, I discovered Headspace and I started meditating more regularly. In fact, very recently because I've had an exorbitant amount of work on my plate, and I've been getting less sleep than I would like in order to complete that work. I've brought back a regular meditation practice twice a day, not just my usual once a day. Headspace makes it really easy. They have so many meditations on there, and they guide you into the meditation and out of the meditation in a way that Just makes it very simple and makes me maintaining the practice really straightforward. Right now, if you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com slash special offer. And if you do that, you'll get a free one month trial, so that's totally free with their full library of meditations for every situation. So there's no meditations that you can't get access to with this offer. You can get access to everything they've got. You just go to headspace.com slash special offer. You get a free one month trial. And hopefully you'll decide to stay with it. I've found that staying with meditation has been immensely beneficial for all aspects of my life. Today's episode of the Human Lab podcast is our fourth and final episode in this month, which is all about skills and athletic performance. Now, in a previous episode, we talked about science based in particular neuroscience based tools for accelerating fat loss. Previous to that, we talked about ways to improve skill learning, motor movements, which also included things like music and piano playing, not just athletic performance. And we've also been exploring other aspects of physical performance throughout the entire month. Today, I want to talk about something that is vitally important for not just athletic performance, but for your entire life and indeed for your longevity. And that's muscle. Now, many of you, when you hear the word muscle think muscle growth and building big muscles. And while we will touch on muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth today, and science based protocols to enhance hypertrophy, we will mainly be talking about muscle as it relates to the nervous system. And I can't emphasize this enough. The whole reason why you have a brain is so that you can move. And one of the things that's exquisite and fantastic about the human brain is that it can direct all sorts of different kinds of movement, different speeds of movement, movement of different durations. We can train our musculature to lift heavier and heavier objects, or we can train our musculature to take us further and further, so called endurance. We can also build smoothness of movement, smoothness of movement, as well as speed of movement, suppleness of movement. All of that is governed by the relationship between the nervous system neurons and their connections to muscle. So when you hear the science of muscle and muscle hypertrophy, you might think, well, I'm not interested in building muscle, but muscle does many critical things. It's important for movement. It's important for metabolism. The more muscle you have and not just muscle size, but the quality of muscle, that's a real thing. The higher your metabolism is, and indeed the healthier you are. It turns out that jumping ability and ability to stand up quickly and to get up off the floor quickly is one of the most predictive markers of aging and biological aging and no surprise that is governed by the brain to muscle connection. In addition, muscle and musculature is vital for posture, and we don't talk about posture and nothing. We all have been told we need to sit up straight or stand up straight, but posture is vitally important for how the rest of our body works. It's vital to how we breathe. It's actually even vital to how alert or sleepy we are. We're going to talk about the musculature for posture. We also are going to talk about muscle as it relates to aesthetic things. Now these are all linked. Muscle for metabolism movement posture and aesthetics of course are linked, right? As our posture changes are aesthetic changes. As our posture and aesthetic changes, how we move changes and as we improve muscle quality, whether or not that's increasing muscle size or not, that changes the way that our entire system, not just our nervous system and our muscular system, but our immune system and the other organs of the body work. Today, as always, we're going to talk a little bit of mechanism. I'm going to explain how neurons control muscle. And then we're going to look at muscle metabolism. How muscle uses energy. I promise to make all of this very simple. I'm actually going to keep it very brief, probably about 10 minutes total. By the end of that 10 minutes, you will understand a lot about the neuromuscular connection, how your brain and nervous system control your muscle and how those muscles work. Then we are going to talk about how muscles use energy and can change how they use energy for sake of getting stronger. If you like, for also increasing the size, so called hypertrophy of muscle and for improving endurance as well as for improving posture and how you move generally. We will touch on some nutritional themes and how that relates to muscle in particular, a specific amino acid that if it's available in your bloodstream frequently enough, and at sufficient levels can help you build and improve the quality of muscle. And we'll talk about specific exercise regimes as well as, of course, supplementation and things that can enhance neuromuscular performance overall. We are also going to talk about recovery. Recovery as everybody knows is when things improve. That's when neurons get better at controlling muscle. That's when muscle grows. That's when muscle gets more flexible. None of that actually happens during training. It happens after training and there is a lot of confusion about how to optimize recovery and how to measure whether or not you are recovered and ready to come back in for another neuromuscular training session. So we'll talk about that as well. Today is going to have a lot of protocols and you're going to come away with a lot of understanding about how you move, how you work and these incredible organs that we call the nervous system and the musculature, the so called neuromuscular system. Before we dive into today's topic, I want to just take about three minutes and cover some essential summary of the previous episode. In the previous episode we talked about fat loss. We talked about sugar induced fat loss. We talked about neat, non-exercise activity thermogenesis for increasing caloric burn and fat oxidation. We talked about how to use cold specifically to enhance fat loss. I described a protocol involving getting into cold of some sort. We've got some sort, whether or not it's ice bath, cold shower, some form of cold could even be a river or an ocean if you have access to that and inducing sugar and then getting out, not crossing your arms or huddling but allowing that cold to evaporate off you and continuing to shiver and then getting back into the colder environment of water or stream or shower, etc. We've just described in a beautifully illustrated protocol that I didn't illustrate, that's why it's beautifully illustrated, at the coldplunge.com. They've made that protocol for you and made it available free of charge for you. There's no obligation there of any kind. You can go to the colplunge.com. There's a little tab that says protocols and you can download that protocol. Someone there I don't know who exactly illustrated it and you can come away with a PDF of what I described in the previous episode. So I just want to make sure that you're aware of that resource. The other announcement I'd like to make is that many of you have asked how you can help support the podcast and there's a very straightforward, zero-cost way to do that and that's to subscribe to our YouTube channel. So if you go to YouTube, if you're not already there watching this now, hit the subscribe button that helps us tremendously to get the word out more broadly about the podcast and we thank you for your support. Most people when they hear the word muscle, they just think about strength. But of course, muscles are involved in everything that we do. They are involved in speaking. They're involved in sitting and standing up. They're involved in lifting objects, including ourselves. They are absolutely essential for maintaining how we breathe. They're absolutely essential for ambulation, for moving and for skills of any kind. So when we think about muscle, we don't just want to think about muscle, the meat that is muscle, but what controls that muscle. And no surprise, what controls muscle is the nervous system. The nervous system does that through three main nodes of control areas of control. And I've talked about these before on a previous podcast, so I will keep this very brief. Basically, we have upper motor neurons in our motor cortex. So those are in our skull. And those are involved in deliberate movement. So if I decide that I'm going to pick my pen and up and put it down, which is what I'm doing right now, my upper motor neurons were involved in generating that movement. So those upper motor neurons send signals down to my spinal cord, where there are two categories of neurons. One are the lower motor neurons. And those lower motor neurons send little wires that we call axons out to our muscles and cause those muscles to contract. They do that by dumping chemicals onto the muscle. In fact, the chemical is acetycalling. I've talked before about acetycalling in the brain, which is vitally important for focus and actually can get neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change and response to experience. But in the neuromuscular system, acetycalling released from motor neurons is the way the only way that muscles can contract. Now, there's another category of neurons in the spinal cord called central pattern generators or CPGs. And those are involved in rhythmic movements. Any time we're walking or doing something where we don't have to think about it to do it deliberately, it's just happening reflexively that central pattern generators and motor neurons. Any time we're doing something deliberately that the top-down control as we call it from the upper motor neurons comes in and takes control of that system. So it's really simple. You've only got three ingredients. You got the upper motor neurons, the lower motor neurons, and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive, you've also got the central pattern generators. So it's a terrifically simple system at that level. But what we're going to focus on today is how that system can control muscle in ways that make that system better. Now, when I say better, I want to be very specific. If your goal is to build larger muscles, there's a way to use your nervous system to trigger high-perchrophy to increase the size of those muscles. And it is indeed controlled by the nervous system. So you can forget the idea that the muscles have memory or that muscles grow in response to something that's just happening within the muscle. It's the nerve-to-muscle connection that actually creates high-perchrophy. I'll talk you exactly about how to optimize that process. In addition, if you want to improve endurance or improve flexibility or suppleness or explosiveness, that is all accomplished by the way that the nervous system engages muscles specifically. And so what that means is we have to ask ourselves, are we going to take control of the upper motor neurons, the central pattern generators or the lower motor neurons or all three in order to get to some endpoint of how the nervous system controls muscle. So neurophysiology 101, I'll give you one piece of history because it's important to know sharington who won the Nobel Prize, called movement the final common path. Why did he say that? Well, the whole reason for having a nervous system, the whole reason for having a brain is so that we can control our movements in very dedicated ways. That is one of the reasons, perhaps the predominant reason why the human brain is so large. You might think, oh, it's so large for thinking and for creativity. Ah, no. When you look at the amount of real estate in the brain that's devoted to different aspects of life, it's mainly vision, our ability to see and movement, our ability to engage in lots of different kinds of movements, slow movements, fast movements, explosive, etc. Other animals don't have that ability because they don't have the mental real estate, they don't have the neural real estate in their brain. They have neuromuscular junctions, they have central pattern generators where they don't have these incredible upper motor neurons that can direct activity the muscles in very specific ways. So we can all feel blessed that we have this system and today I'm going to teach you how to use that system toward particular endpoints. So if we decide that we are going to direct our muscles in some particular movement of any kind, whether or not it's a weightlifting exercise or whether it's a yoga movement or simply picking up and putting down a pin, we are engaging flexors and extensors and our body is covered with flexors and extensors all over. So for instance, our bicep is a flexor and our tricep is an extensor. Those are what are called antagonistic muscles. They move the limbs in opposite directions. So if you bring your wrist closer to your shoulder, that's flexion using your bicep if you move your wrist further away from your shoulder, that's extension using your tricep. And without getting into a lot of detail, the way that the nerves and brain are wired up to muscle make it such that when a flexor is activated when the nerve dumps chemical, I see it will call in onto the muscle to activate the biceps. The triceps is inhibited. It's prevented from engaging. There are ways to bypass this, but that's the typical mode of action. The converse is also true when our tricep is in activated when we move our wrist away from our shoulder, our bicep is inhibited. And we have flexors like our abdominal muscles and we have extensors in our lower back. Many of you probably know this, but some of you probably don't that your spine has flexors to move basically your chin toward your waist. And those are your abdominal muscles among others. And you have extensors that move your chin basically back like looking up toward the ceiling and those are your extensors. You have other muscles that are stabilizing muscles and things of that sort, but those movements of flexion and extension in the fact that they are what we call reciprocally, intervated or mutual inhibition. You hear different language around this, is characteristic of most of our limb movements. So hamstring and quadriceps. The hamstring brings the ankle closer back towards the glutes. Basically it's lifting your heel up, which is almost always done toward the back. Whereas your quadriceps is the extensor opposite to the hamstrings. So you get the idea. So flexors and extensors and it's the neurons that control those flexors and extensors that allow us to move in particular ways. So now you have heard neuromuscular physiology and it's simplest form, but I do want this to be accessible. I want to get just briefly, just briefly, into some of the underlying metabolism of how muscles use and create energy. In doing that, we will be in a great position to understand all the tools that follow about how to optimize the neuromuscular system for your particular goals. So in the previous episode about fat loss, we talked about light policies. The breakdown of fat into fatty acids, so it can be used as fuel and it ended in a step where we got ATP, which is the bottleneck and final common path for all energy producing functions in the body. There are other ways, but basically ATP is the key element there. Now with muscles, they don't function on fats normally, what they are going to function on their ability to move and their ability to do things and allow us to move in any way that we want to is based on a process of glycolysis. You don't have to know any chemistry, so if I say the words carbon or hydrogen or something like that, don't freak out, you don't have to understand any chemistry. But basically what happens is you've got this available sugar resource that's stored in muscle, okay? And that's glucose. And that glucose has six carbons and six and six waters basically. That can be broken down into two sets of three carbons, all right? So basically you take glucose and you break it into these two little batches of carbons that we call pyruvate. So six divided by two is three, so you get three and three pyruvate. And generates a little bit of ATP of energy, but just a little bit. Now if there's oxygen available, okay? If there's sufficient oxygen there, what can happen is that pyruvate can be brought to the mitochondria and through a whole set of things that you probably don't want to hear about right now, like the electron transport chain and citric acid cycle. What happens is it's broken down and you get 28 to 30 ATP, which is a lot of ATP. So the only things you need to know, the only things you need to know about this process is that glucose and glycogen are broken down into pyruvate. You have a little bit of energy from that. And when I say energy, I mean the ability to move. It's fuel. It literally just gets burned up. But if there's oxygen available and that's key, then within the mitochondria, you can create 28 to 38, which is a lot of ATP. Now what does this mean? This means that movement of muscle is metabolically expensive. Indeed, compared to other tissues compared to fat compared to bone compared to almost all other tissues except brain tissue. Muscle is the most metabolically demanding, which is why people who have more muscle relative to out-of-post tissue to fat, they can eat more and they're more of a furnace. They just kind of burn that up. Okay? So even if you didn't understand anything that I just said, what you probably did here and that I hope you heard is that if you have oxygen around, you can create energy from this fuel source that we call glycogen and glucose. But what if there isn't oxygen around? And what is that like? Well, you've experienced that. I'm not talking about oxygen in the environment. I'm talking about oxygen in the muscle. So if you've ever carried a box while moving or you're carrying heavy groceries to the car or you're exercising particularly hard and you felt the burn, well, that burning, which most people think is lactic acid, is actually a process by which pyruvate, which, as I said before, normally could be converted into ATP, if there's oxygen, well, if there's not enough oxygen, because that muscle is working too hard or too long, what ends up happening is that hydrogen molecule comes in there and you get something called lactate. So believe it or not, humans don't make lactic acid. That's another species. We make lactate. And we hear that lactate is bad. We need to buffer the burn or avoid the burn that lactic acid and lactate are what prevent us for performing as well as we ought to be able to, or for going as far as we possibly could in an endurance event. Guess what? That's not true at all. Lactate has three functions, all of which are really interesting and really important. First of all, it's a buffer against acidity. You don't want muscle to get too acidic because it can't function. You don't want anybody to get too acidic. So that burn that you feel is acidity in that environment, that and lactate, what most people call lactic acid, but again, we don't make lactic acid. Lactate is there to buffer that to reduce the amount of burn. So most people have this exactly backwards. So when you feel that burn, that is not lactic acid. That is lactate that's present to suppress the burn to suppress acidity. It's also a fuel. When you feel that burn, lactate is shuttle to those areas of the muscle. And there's an actual fuel burning process where in the absence of oxygen, you can continue to generate muscular contractions. Now this is informative because it also tells us that that burning that acidity that we feel can inhibit the way that our muscles work, but that lactate comes in and allows our muscles to continue to function. So we'll talk a little bit more about what this whole lactate thing in the burn means, but it's a really important process. And it's amazing to me that most people understand it in exactly the incorrect way. They think ollactic acid is bad and the burn is bad. No, it reveals a number of really important things are going on with this vital molecule lactate, which can reduce acidity, reduce the burn, as well as act as a fuel. Now here's where it gets really, really cool. And if you don't have enough of an incentive to exercise based on all the information out there about how to make you live longer and make your heart better, etc. Here's a reason that regardless of what kind of exercise you do, if it's weight training or running or cycling or swimming, that every once in a while, about 10% of the time, you should exercise to the point of intensity where you start to feel that so-called burn, right? The reason for that is that lactate shows up to the site of the burn, so to speak, and it acts as a hormonal signal for other organs of the body in a very positive way. As you may recall from a very early episode of the human-minlab podcast, I talked about what a hormonal is and how it works. We have lots of different kinds of hormones, but hormones are chemicals that are released in one location in the body and travel, have effects on lots of other organs of the body. So when I say that lactate acts as a hormonal signal, what I mean is that it's in a position to influence tissues that are outside of the muscle. And basically it can send signals to the heart, to the liver, and to the brain, and it can have effects on the heart, the liver, and the brain that are very positive. Okay, so just a zoom out for a second, I promise we won't get any more technical than this, we will get into tools and protocols that are really straightforward. But what I'm telling you is that if you feel a burn from a particular exercise or movement, that burn is going to be buffered by this molecule we call lactate. Lactate will then provide additional fuel for additional work, so this is a good incentive, provide you can do it safely to quote unquote work through the burn. That burn is a axis of beacon to the lactate which comes in and allows you to do more work. It's not a signal to stop necessarily, I mean stop if you're doing something unsafe, but it's a signal that lactate should come in and allow you to continue to do work. And it can act as a hormonal signal, lactate can then travel to the heart and to the liver and to the brain and can enhance their function in positive ways, not just in those moments, but in the period of time that follows. So many people are curious about how they can exercise to make their brain better, that's one of the most common questions I get. What I'm telling you is that provided you can do it safely. By engaging the so-called burn, which is a different threshold for everybody, right? Your hill run will be different than my hill run to generate the burn, but provided you can do that for about 10% of your workouts or of an individual workout or activity of any kind. You are generating the activity of this lactate-based hormonal signal that can improve the function of neurons, and it does that if you want to know for the FISIanados by improving the function of another cell type called the astrocytes, which are a glial cell type, which are very involved in clearance of debris from the brain. They're involved in the formation of synapses connections between neurons and the brain. So put simply, if you're an exerciseer, if you're doing movement of any kind and you're interested in allocating some of that movement toward enhancing brain, heart and liver health. There is a nice set of scientific data that points to the fact that getting lactate shuttle to the muscles by engaging this burning sensation is advantageous for the health of those other tissues. So as I mentioned, that burn is present from lack of oxygen being present, and then the hydrogen comes in and you get this lactate. But this process of lactate acting as a buffer of fuel and a positive hormonal signal for other tissues occurs only if there's oxygen. So if you feel the burn, you definitely want to focus on your breathing at that point. That will be the time to take deep inhales and try and bring more oxygen into your system. It's definitely not a time to hold your breath. And if ever you've run to the point of feeling the burn and then you were exercising any way on the treadmill or on the bike or whatever and felt that burn and then you held your breath, it feels much more intense. By breathing, you bring lactate to the site and you're able to allow lactate to act more as a buffer of fuel and hormonal signal. And the reason I brought this up today is because as I mentioned, so many people are interested in using exercise, not just for sake of improving physical health and well-being and performance, but also for enhancing their brain. And there are a lot of data out there speaking to the findings that exercise of various kinds can increase neurogenesis, the creation of new neurons. Well, the unfortunate news is that while that's true in mice, there is very little evidence for enhanced neurogenesis from exercise or otherwise in humans. There's a little bit and there are a few sites within the brain such as the dentate gyros at the hippocampus, which may be involved in the formation of new memories. To be clear, the dentate gyros is definitely involved in the formation of new memories, whether or not the new neurons that are added there in humans are involved in new memories is. The evidence for that is weak at best, frankly, whereas in animals that the data are quite strong. But most of the data point to the fact that hormonal signals, things that are transported in the blood during exercise are what are beneficial for the brain. And that those signals are not causing the increase in the number of neurons in the dentate gyros or otherwise. That it's more about the health of the connections between the neurons growth factors of various kinds, things like IGF1, just a long list of these things. So if you've heard the exercise increases the number of neurons in your brain, well that's not true, and that probably is a good thing, frankly, because we always hear more neurons, more neurons as if it's a good thing. But the brain doesn't do so well with bringing in entirely new elements. It has a hard time negotiating that and making use of those new elements. We know about this from things like the cochlear implant where deaf people are given a device where they suddenly can hear. Some people really like that. Deaf people really like that and can benefit from it. Other deaf people find that it's very intrusive. That it's hard to take a, you know, an existing neural circuit in the brain and incorporate a lot of new information. So new neurons as great as that sounds, more neurons, more neurons. It actually might not be the best way for the nervous system to change and modify itself and to promote its own longevity. So when I tell you, you know, not such great evidence from a new neurons past puberty, that's what the data really show in humans. And I sort of knock back the data on exercise and neurogenesis. Don't let that depress you. If you have to mention your family, don't make that, don't translate that into a new neural circuit. A necessarily that you will develop dementia. Understand the exercise is still beneficial for the brain and other aspects of the nervous system. But that it's going to be doing it through these hormonal signals, things like IGF1, things like this lactate pathway. When you experience the burn from exercise. And again, you don't want to try and get this feeling of a burn throughout the entire episode of exercise. That will be far too intense and when it hit your recovery. And I think it'd be good for performance either. It's only about 10% of your total effort in anyone exercise about that's going to give you this positive effect. So now you know how to devote a small portion of your exercise, 10% in order for muscle and lactate to benefit other tissues. Namely, your heart, your liver and your brain. I'd now like to shift our attention to how to use specific aspects of muscular contraction to improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, as well as improving muscle strength. There are a lot of reasons to want to get stronger. And I should just mention that it's not always the case that getting stronger involves muscles getting bigger. There are ways for muscles to get stronger without getting bigger. However, increasing the size of a muscle almost inevitably increases the strength of that muscle, at least to some degree. Reason why most everyone should want to get their muscle stronger is that muscles are generally getting progressively weaker across the lifespan. So when I say getting stronger, it's not necessarily about being able to move increasing amounts of weight in the gym. Although if that's your goal, what I'm about to discuss will be relevant to that. But rather to offset some of the normal decline in strength and posture and the ability to generate a large range of movement safely that occurs as we age. So I mentioned at the beginning of the episode, we just tend to lose function in this neuromuscular system as we get older. And doing things to offset that has been shown again and again to be beneficial for the neuromuscular system, for protection of injury, for enhancing the strength of bones and bone density. So there are a lot of reasons to use resistance exercise that extend far beyond just the desire to increase muscle size. Because I know many of you are interested in increasing muscle size, but many of you are not. So there's an important principle of muscle physiology called the henomen size principle. And the henomen size principle essentially says that we recruit what are called motor units. Motor units are just the connections between nerve and muscle from a pattern that stares cases from low threshold to high threshold. What this means is when you pick up something that is light, you're going to use the minimum amount of nerve to muscle energy in order to move that thing. Likewise, when you pick up an object that's heavy, you're going to use the minimum amount of nerve to muscle connectivity and energy in order to increase muscle energy. activity and energy in order to move that object. So it's basically a conservation of energy principle. Now, if you continue to exert effort of movement, what will happen is you will tend to recruit more and more motor units with time. And that process of recruiting more neurons, more lower motor neurons, as if you recall from the beginning of the episode, these lower motor neurons are in our spinal cord and they actually dump a chemical, I'll see you to calling on muscle, cause the muscles to contract, as you recruit more and more of these motor units. These connections between these lower motor neurons and muscle, that's when you start to get changes in the muscle. That's when you open the gate for the potential for the muscles to get stronger and to get larger if that's what your goal is. And so the way this process works has been badly misunderstood in the kind of online literature of weight training and bodybuilding and even in sports physiology. The hennaman size principle is kind of a foundational principle within muscle physiology. But many people have come to interpret it by saying that the way to recruit high threshold motor units, the ones that are hard to get to, is to just use heavy weights. And that's actually not the case, as we'll talk about the research supports that weight in a very large range of sort of percentage of your maximum anywhere from 30 to 80 percent. So weights that are not very light, but are moderately light, to heavy can cause changes in the connections between nerve and muscle that lead to muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy. Put differently, heavy weights can help build muscle and strength, but they are not required. What one has to do is adhere to a certain number of parameters, just a couple of key variables that I'll spell out for you. And if you do that, you can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy, muscle size, and or muscle strength if that's what you want to do. And you don't necessarily have to use heavy weights in order to do that. Now I'm sure the power lifters and the people that like to move heavy weights around will say, no, if you want to get strong, you absolutely have to heavy weights. And that might be true if you want to get very strong, but for most people who are interested in supporting their muscular such that they offset any age related decline in strength or in increasing hypertrophy and strength to some degree, there really isn't a need to lie about the hemoman size principle, which many people out there are doing. And claiming that you absolutely need to use the heaviest weights possible in order to build strength and muscle. So I'm going to explain all how all of this works in simple terms. So first of all, let's just talk about what hypertrophy is and what strength changes in the muscle are. We can make this very simple as well. If this were a muscle physiology class, we would talk all about you know, myofibrels and sarcomeers and all that stuff. We're not going to do that. That's not the purpose of today's conversation. If you're interested in that, as well as a lot of the other information that I'm going to discuss in more detail, I highly encourage you to check out the YouTube channel from and the writings of Dr. Andy Galpin. He's a PhD and a full professor in exercise physiology. He's extremely knowledgeable in this entire area of science-based tools for hypertrophy, how strength and hypertrophy really work. His lab does everything from biopsy, how muscles working with athletes and typical folks, as well. A lot of the information that you're going to hear from me in the next 15 minutes or so comes from an extensive exploration of the work that he and his colleagues have done as well as folks like Brad Showenfield, another academic who's superb in this whole space of muscle physiology and from a lengthy conversation that I had with Andy, Dr. Galpin, prior to this episode. So if we want to think about muscle hypertrophy, we have to ask what is changing when muscles get larger or stronger. And there are really just three ways that muscles can be stimulated to change. So let's review those three ways and talk about what happens inside the muscle. So there are three major stimuli for changing the way that muscle works and making muscles stronger, larger, or better in some way. And those are stress, tension, and damage. Those three things don't necessarily all have to be present. But stress of some kind has to exist. Something has to be different in the way that the nerve communicates with the muscle and the way that the muscle contracts are performs, that makes the muscle need to change. So this is very reminiscent of neuroplasticity in the brain. Something needs to happen. Certain chemicals need to be present. Certain processes need to happen or else a tissue simply won't change itself. But if those processes and events do happen, then the tissue has essentially no option except but to change. So muscles move, as I mentioned, because nerves dump chemical onto the muscles. But they move because they have these things called myocininactin filaments. And if you want to read up on this, you can look on the internet, you can put the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. If you really want to go deep down that rabbit hole, it's interesting. You can learn about this in a muscle physiology class. But basically along the length of the muscle, you have what's called myocin. And just think of myocin as it's kind of like a wire. It's like a bunch of beads and wires that extend across the muscle. I think that's a simplest way to describe it. And the myocin is surrounded by these little beads called actin. The way muscles get bigger is that basically the myocin gets thicker. It's a protein, right? And it gets thicker. So put this in your mind. If you're listening to this or even if you're watching it on YouTube, the way to think about this whole actin mice and thing and muscles getting bigger is imagine that you're holding a bouquet of balloons, a bunch of balloons by their strings. Except you're not holding the strings all at their bottom. So the bouquet isn't nicely arranged. It's not like some balloons that are all up at the top and you're holding the strings down at the bottom. Imagine that one of the balloons that is very close to your hand, another one is a little bit higher up. And so this bouquet is very disorganized. In other words, the string extending out of your hand, the strings rather extending out of your hand, are all different lengths. And so the balloons are all over the place. That's essentially what myocin looks like in the muscle. And those strings are what we call the filaments. And then the myocin head that is the balloon. When you stress a muscle properly or you give it sufficient tension or you damage the muscle, just enough. There's an adaptive response that takes place where protein is synthesized. And it's a very specific protein. It's myocin. The myocin gets thicker. In other words, the balloons get bigger. So the way to think about muscle growth and the way to think about muscles getting stronger is that those balloons get bigger and the muscle gets thicker. Now the question then should be as always, how does that happen? I mean, the muscle doesn't really know anything about what's happening in the outside world. The way it happens is the nerve, the neuron has to tell the muscle to get stronger. And it does that through a see what we call a signaling cascade. It talks to the muscle in terms of chemicals. It doesn't whisper to it or shout out, hey, get bigger. What it does it releases certain chemicals that within the muscle, there are certain chemicals released rather that make those balloons, as I'm referring to them, the mice and get thicker. So let's talk about the stimulus for doing that. And if already in your mind you're imagining, oh my goodness, you know these balloons of muscle are going to get thick, thick, thick, thick, thick, thick, thick. And it's just going to spiral out of control. Don't worry about that. People invest a ton of time and energy into trying to make their muscles larger. It's actually much harder for people to do than you might think. But I do want to give one exception because it illustrates an important principle of where we're headed next. Everybody has imbalances in how muscles can grow, how well muscles can grow or how poorly or how challenging it is for their muscles to grow. Now, many people who are afraid of like getting too bulky, for instance, are afraid of lifting weights. But I think the research shows now that everyone of pretty much every age should be doing some sort of resistance exercise, even if that's body weight exercises in order to offset this age related decline in muscle contractal ability, muscle strength, etc. improve bone density. There's nothing good about getting frail and weak over time. And people who invest the effort into doing resistance exercises of some kind, whether or not with bands or with weights or with body weight, really benefit tremendously at a whole body level at a systemic level as well as in terms of muscle strength. There is a good predictor of how well or how efficient you will be in building the strength and or if you like the size of a given muscle. And it has everything to do with those upper motor neurons that are involved in deliberate control of muscle. You can actually do this test right now. You can just kind of march across your body mentally and see whether or not you can independently contract any or all of your muscles. So for instance, if you are sitting in a chair or you're standing, see whether or not you can contract your calf muscle just using those upper motor neurons, sending a signal down and deliberately isolating the calf muscle. If you can contract the calf muscle, hard to the point where that muscle almost feels like it's trying to cramp like it hurts just a little bit. You know, it might not be extremely painful nor is it going to have no sensation whatsoever. Chances are you have very good upper motor neuron to calf control. And chances are if you can isolate that what they call that brain or mind muscle connection and you can contract the muscles to the point where it cramps a little bit that you hold a decent to high potential to change the strength and the size of that muscle if you train it properly. Now if you have a hard time doing that chances are you won't be able to do that. If for instance you focus on your back muscle. Like we all have these muscles called the lathe, the let's assume is door C muscles which basically are involved in chin ups and things like that but they're functioned from a more of a canysiology standpoint is to move the elbow back behind the body. Okay, so it's not about flexing your bicep. It's about moving your elbow back behind your body. If you can do that mentally or you can do that physical movement of moving your elbow back behind your body and you can contract that muscle hard, chances are that you have the capacity to enhance this strength and or size of that particular muscle because you have the neural control of that muscle. This is a key feature of the neural muscular system to appreciate as we begin to talk more about specific protocols. Because everything about muscle hypertrophy, about stimulating muscle growth, is about generating isolated contractions, about challenging specific muscles in a very unnatural way. If you were as with strength it's about using musculature as a system moving weights, moving resistance, moving the body. The specific goal of hypertrophy is to isolate specific nerve to muscle pathways so that you stimulate the chemical and signaling transduction events in muscles so that those muscles respond by getting larger. So there's a critical distinction in terms of getting stronger versus trying to get muscles to be larger hypertrophy per se and it has to do with how much you isolate those muscles. Muscle isolation is not a natural phenomenon. It's not something that we normally do when we walk, we don't think okay, right calf contract, left calf, contract, no. You just generate those rhythmic movements and of course there's no reason for them to get stronger or larger in response to those movements. Let's say you were to do a kind of strange experiment of attaching 30 pound weights to your ankles and you were to do those movements. Well if you weren't specifically contracting your calves in each step there's no reasons for the calves to take on the bulk of the work and you would distribute that work across your hip flexors and other aspects of your musculature. Your whole nervous system seeks to gain efficiency, it seeks to spread out the effort. So you can nest this as a principle for yourself which is if you want to get stronger it's really about moving progressively greater loads or increasing the amount of weight that you move whereas if you're specifically interested in generating hypertrophy it's all about trying to generate those really hard, almost painful, localized contractions of muscle. Now of course how much weight you use in order to generate those contractions will also impact hypertrophy. But I think most people don't really understand the mind muscle connection. It sounds like a great thing but it's actually one of the things you want to avoid if your goal is simply to become more supple or to become stronger. You want to do the movements properly and safely of course but it's the opposite of hypertrophy where with hypertrophy you're really trying to make that particular muscle. Sometimes two muscles do the majority if not all the work whereas in moving force loads in trying to generate activity of any kind like lifting a bar or doing a chin up or something. Those so-called compound movements involve a lot of muscle groups. If your goal is to be better at those you want to avoid isolating in any one particular muscle. Now I know this probably comes across as a kind of a obvious duh especially to the folks that have spent a lot of time in the gym aimed at getting hypertrophy. But I think most people don't appreciate that it's the nerve to muscle connections and the distinction between isolating nerve to muscle connections versus distributing the work of nerve to muscle connections that's vital in determining whether or not you generate hypertrophy isolated nerve to muscle contractions versus strength and offsetting strength loss which would be distributed nerve to muscle connections. If ever there was an area of practical science that was very confused, very controversial and almost combative at times it would be this issue of how best to train. I suppose the only thing that's even more barbed wire of a conversation than that is how best to eat for health. Those seem to be the two most common areas of online battle. And the scientific literature has a lot to say about both of those things. Again my sources for what I'm about to tell you are Professor Andy Galpin and colleagues. I know there are other excellent people out there in the field but I really trust his work he does very controlled studies. He spent a lot of time in this space and what's really exciting is that in just the last three years or so it's been a tremendous amount of information to come out about the practical steps that one can take in order to maximize the benefits of resistance exercise of any kind. So I'm going to talk about those and I'm going to talk about the research. I will provide some links both to a couple of the more in-depth tutorials from Dr. Galpin as well as some of the papers that the information I'm about to tell you stems from. There's a lot of information saying that you need to move weights that are 80 to 90% of your one-ret maximum or 70% or cycle that for three weeks on and then go to more moderate weights. There are a lot of paths as some people say there are a lot of ways to add up numbers to get 100. There's a near infinite number of ways to add up different numbers to get to 100. What's very clear now from all the literature that's transpired and especially from the literature in this last three years is that once you know roughly your one repetition maximum, the maximum amount of weight that you can perform an exercise with for one repetition in good form, full range of motion that it's very clear that moving weights or using bands or using bodyweight for instance in the 30 to 80% of one-ret maximum that is going to be the most beneficial range in terms of muscle hypertrophy and strength. So muscle growth and strength and there will be a bias if you're moving weights that are in the 75% 80% range or maybe even going above that 85 and 90% you're going to bias your improvements towards strength gains. This is true and if you use weights that are in the 30% of your one-ret petition maximum or 40% or 50% and doing many more repetitions of course then you are biasing towards hypertrophy and what some people like to call muscle endurance but that's a little bit of a complicated term because endurance we almost always think of as relating to running or swimming or some long bouts of activity. So 30 to 80% of one repetition maximum doesn't really seem to matter for sake of hypertrophy except at the far ends when you're really trying to bias for strength. Now it's is clear however that one needs to perform those sets to failure where you can't perform another repetition in good form again or near to failure and there's all sorts of interesting nomenclature that's popping up all over the internet, some of which is scientific, some of which is not scientific about how you are supposed to perceive how close you were to failure etc but there's some very interesting principles that relate to how the nerves connect to the muscles that strongly predict whether or not this exercise that your performing will be beneficial for you or not. So here's how it goes. For individuals that are untrained meaning they have been doing resistance to exercise for anywhere for a zero probably out to about two years although for some people it might be zero to one year but those are the so-called beginners. There's sort of untrained for those people the key parameter seems to be to perform enough sets of a given exercise per muscle per week. The same is also true for people that have been training for one or two years or more. What differs is how many sets to perform depending on whether or not you're trained or untrained. So let's say you're somebody who's been doing some resistance exercise kind of on and off over the years and you decide you want to get serious about that for sake of sport or offsetting age related declines in strength. The range of sets to do in order to improve strength to activate these cascades in the muscle ranges anywhere from two believe it or not to 20 per week. Again these are sets per week and they don't necessarily all have to be performed in the same weight training session. I will talk about numbers of sessions. So it appears that five sets per week in this 30 per cent to 80 per cent of the one repetition maximum range getting close to failure or occasionally actually going to full muscular failure which isn't really full muscular failure but the inability to generate a contraction of the muscle and move the weight in good form. I'll go deeper into that in a moment but about five sets per week is what's required just to maintain your muscle. So think about that. If you're somebody who's kind of a versus resistance training you are going to lose muscle size and strength your metabolism will drop your posture will get worse. Everything in the in the context of nerve to muscle connectivity will get worse over time. Unless you are generating five sets or more of this 30 per cent to 80 per cent of your one repetition maximum per week. Okay? So what this means is for the typical person who hasn't done a lot of weight training you need to do at least five sets per muscle group. Now that's just a maintain and then there's this huge range that goes all the way up to 15 and in some case 20 sets per week. Now how many sets you perform is going to depend on the intensity of the work that you perform. This is where it gets a little bit controversial but I think nowadays most people agree and Dr. Galpin confirmed that 10 per cent not to be confused with the 10 per cent we discussed earlier but 10 per cent of the sets of a given workout or 10 percent of workouts overall should be of the high intensity sort where one is actually working to muscular failure. Now I say not true muscular failure because in theory you have a concentric movement which is the kind of lifting of the weight and then you have the eccentric portion of muscle contraction which is the lowering and the eccentric movements because of the way that muscle fibers lengthen and that sliding act in myusin that we talked about before you're always stronger in lowering something than you are in lifting it. But the point being that most of your training, most of your sets should be not to failure and the reason for that is it allows you to do more volume of work without fatiguing the nervous system and depleting the nerve to muscle connection in ways that are detrimental. So we can make this simple perform anywhere from five to 15 sets of resistance exercise per week and that's per muscle and that's in this 30 to 80 percent of what your one repetition maximum. That seems to be the the most scientifically supported way of offsetting any decline in muscle if you're working in the kind of five set range and in increasing muscle strength when you start to get up into the 10 and 15 set range. Now the caveat to that is everyone varies and muscles vary in terms of their recoverability depending on how well you can control the contraction of muscles deliberately and you can actually figure that out by sort of marching you might take five minutes and just kind of march across your body and mentally try and control the contractions of muscles in a very deliberate way to the point where you can generate a hard contraction and you may have to move a limb in order to do this by the way. I'm not talking about just mentally can you know contracting your bicep without moving your wrist. I'm talking about doing that without any weight in hand or any band or any resistance. If you can generate a high intensity contraction using these upper motor neuron to lower motor neuron pathways to muscle you might think well I should perform many more sets, right? But actually the opposite is true. If you can generate high intensity muscular contractions using your brain using your neurons it will take fewer sets in order to stimulate the muscle to maintain itself and to stimulate the muscle in order to grow or get stronger. So the more efficient you are in recruiting motor units remember hennaman size principle the recruitment of more motor units which isn't just muscles it's nerve-to-muscle connections. The better you are at doing that the more you will recruit these so-called high threshold motor units the ones that are hard to get to the more you will kick off the cascades of things within muscle that stimulate muscle growth and strength. So if you have muscles that are challenging to contract it's going to take more sets in order to stimulate the desired effect in those muscles not fewer. If you have muscles that you are very good at generating force within it's going to take fewer sets. Now how many sets you are going to have to determine that it's going to depend for those of you that are using like 50% of your one repetition maximum because you're doing a lot of repetitions you might find that three or four five sets will maintain the muscle you might decide to do that once at one point in the week and then do it again right? So if you're going for 10 sets a week you can divide that among two sessions you can do that all in one session. The data really show it doesn't matter. There are some differences in terms of whether or not you're trying to generate maximum intensity within a workout or whether or not you want to spread that out but in general resistance workouts of any kind tend to be best favored by workouts that are somewhere between 45 minutes and 60 minutes and generally not longer than 60 minutes because that's when all the things like cortisol and some of the inflammatory pathways really start to create a situation in the muscle and in the body that's not so great for you. So it's not a hard and fast rule you know that the act doesn't drop at 60 minutes but it's pretty clear that performing this five to 15 sets per week whether or not it's in one workout or whether it's divided up across multiple workouts is really what's going to be most beneficial. And please do keep in mind Hennemann's size principle and the recruitment of motor units and remember the better you are at contracting particular muscles and isolating those muscles the fewer sets likely you need to do in order to get the desired effect. Now what about people who have been training for a while? If you're somebody who's been doing weight training for a while the data point to the fact that more volume can be beneficial even for muscles that you are very efficient at contracting. Now the curve on this the graph on this begins again at about five sets per week for maintaining a given muscle group and extends all the way out to 25 or 30 sets per week. However there are individuals who for whatever reason can generate so much force they're so good at training muscles that they can generate so much force in just four or six or eight sets that doing this large volume of work is actually going to be counterproductive. So everyone needs to figure out for themselves first of all how often you're willing to do resistance exercise of any kind. And again it doesn't matter if you're using bands or weights or body weight for instance if you're doing chin-ups chances are unless you are very strong that you're not using weights you're just using something that you can hold on to or if you're doing push-ups some of you will be working in that 30 to 80 percent of your one repetition maximum range. It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be moving weights in a gym for instance. So the purpose here is to figure out what muscles you're trying to train that's an issue that we'll talk about in a moment and then it does appear that somewhere between five and 15 sets per week is going to be what the thing that's going to work for most people. Now this is based on a tremendous amount of work that was done by Andy Galpin and colleagues Brad, Sean Field and colleagues and others. My grover's there's a huge group of people out there doing exercise physiology and a small subset of them that are linking them back to real world protocols that don't just pertain to athletes. So that's mainly what I'm focusing on today. And surely there will be exceptions. Now if you're going to divide the sets across the week you're not going to do all 10 sets for instance for a given muscle group in one then of course it's imperative that the muscles recover in between sessions and we are going to talk about recovery both at the systemic level, the whole nervous system and at the local level, the nerve to muscle and local even muscle level. We'll talk about that in about 10 minutes when we talk about recovery. I do want to mention something very important which is that everything I'm referring to here it has to do with full range of motion. Okay and you might ask well what about the speeds of movements. This actually turns out to be a really interesting data set for generating explosiveness and speed. So for sprinters or throwing sports or for people that want to generate a lot of jumping power it does appear that learning to move weights as fast as you safely can, especially under moderate to heavy loads can increase explosiveness and speed. And most of that effect is from changes in the neurons. It's not from changes in the muscle. It's from changes in the way that the upper motor neurons communicate with the lower motor neurons and generating a pathway a neural circuit as we call it that is very efficient at generating action potentials which are the electricity within neurons to trigger the muscle. Now of course there are events that happen from nerve to muscle but the takeaway from that enormous literature frankly is that if you want to get faster yes it can be beneficial to get stronger but if you want to dedicate resistance training specifically to jumping higher to running faster to throwing further and these sorts of things that learning to generate force with increasing speed is going to be beneficial. On the flip side of that for people that want to get stronger it appears that the slowing down of the weight as things get harder is a key parameter in recruiting those high threshold motor units. So let me phrase that a little bit differently. Think about a set in the gym or think about a set of push ups or a set of pull ups initially you can move very fast if you like. If you want to generate high perchography the goal really is not necessarily to move super slow but to isolate the muscle and therefore not to use momentum rather than lift weights as they say challenge muscles. If you want to get stronger you're going to be distributing that effort over more muscles and more of your nervous system. For generating explosiveness and speed it's very clear that learning to generate forces quickly and to move heavy or moderately heavy loads quickly is going to be beneficial because of the way that you train the motor neurons and of course changes in the muscle but this could look different for different sports and obviously you want to make safety paramount if you're injured you're not going to be able to train at all for sport or for any purpose that is and so what this would involve is something like 60 to 75% of a one repetition maximum and then in a controlled way moving that as quickly as one can throughout the entire set and certainly not going to failure because as you approach failure the inability to move the weight with good form the weight inevitably slows down. In fact there are a lot of new technologies now that are focused on informing people of how quickly the bar or weight is moving. I saw an advertisement for this the other day. There are things that people can attach to bars that will literally speak to you as you're doing a set and inform you whether or not you're moving four times more slowly per rep than you were at the beginning and trying to hone in on the exact speed of movement. In talking to these experts prior to this episode it does appear that for sake of high purtrophy as long as you're not moving the muscles so quickly that you start to distribute the effort to lots of other muscles it doesn't really matter because as the the set gets harder the motor units that you recruit will increase the number of neurons that you recruit and the number of muscle fibers in which are these high threshold and muscle fibers will increase and so it's really only for purposes of high purtrophy that you really need to be concerned about how quickly the weight is slowing down. However if you're trying to get faster more explosive and generate more speed and jumping power throwing power things of that sort you never really want to use a weight or get to a portion of the set where you're moving the bar very very slowly and I'm sure as I say that some of the exercise physiologists and events trainers out there will come after me with pitchforks which is fine I'd love to see the literature that shows that low gear slow movements with very heavy weights can indeed improve explosiveness and that may in fact be the case but the data that I was able to access was essentially as I described just a moment ago. So as you're probably starting to realize you need to customize a resistance practice for your particular needs and goals and I certainly am not the first to suggest that people purriedize their training that they do things from anywhere from one month to six months and to see how it goes and to make modifications as they go because the nervous system in particular the neuromuscular system changes very quickly at the beginning of training in fact some of the changes that one can see when they first embrace or start a resistance training can be very remarkable but they tend to slow over time. So we've talked about a few principles the fact that you need to get sufficient volume you need at least five sets to maintain and you probably need about ten sets per muscle group in order to improve muscle that moving weights of moderate to moderately heavy weight quickly is going to be best for explosiveness that isolating muscles and really contracting muscles hard something that you can test by just when you're outside the training session. Even the night you can cramped the muscle hard will really will tell you your capacity to improve high-perchrophy or to engage strength changes in that muscle that your ability to contract a muscle hard is inversely related to the number sets that you should do in order to isolate and stimulate that muscle and there are some other things that can enhance the whole process of building nerve to muscle connections making them more efficient and generating if you like more strength and hypertrophy. One of them I loath to say I was told is in-between set contractions. The other name for this is the people in the gym does typically seem to be guys in the gym flexing their muscles in-between sets and indeed the research supports the fact that contractions of about 30 seconds in-between the actual work sets they're not going to favor better performance on the work sets if anything they're going to compromise them but those hard contractions in-between sets for a variety of reasons related to local muscle metabolism as well as what we talked about before which are stress tension and damage they seem to improve stress tension and damage and the nerve to muscle contraction in ways that facilitate hypertrophy. In other words you see that person flexing in-between sets in the gym provided that they're really isolating that muscle and provided it's one that they ought to be improving not one of these people that always skips like day type of people these were highly asymmetric although that's up to them that process of flexing in-between sets does seem to improve the nerve to muscle connection and enhance hypertrophy and I say I was loath to say it because you know nowadays with phones it seems like the end of every set includes a selfie and that's sort of like the 11th rep of every set I like to joke it seems like very few people are capable of actually going into the gym and doing a workout without taking and picture themselves which I think is is fine if that's your thing although I must say that the the athletes that I know and even the recreational athletes that I know who seem to get the most out of their training and who also seem to get the most out of other aspects of their life seem to be able to control their phone behavior both in the gym and outside of the gym but that's more of an editorial point there. In an earlier episode I talked about estrogen and testosterone and during that discussion I talked about the use of resistance exercise specifically for increasing testosterone both in men and in women and indeed that is a powerful effect of resistance exercise and indeed it's mediated by the nerve to muscle connections we talked about that in that earlier episode. I just want to briefly mention that protocol since it's distinctly different from the other protocols I've talked about today the protocols I've talked about today thus far of explosive movements or of hypertrophy based training provided the training is 60 minutes or less will cause increases in serum testosterone that's been shown over and over again and if the session extends too long past 75 minutes and is of sufficiently high intensity chances are testosterone levels will start to drop and cortisol levels will go up in ways that could be detrimental to recovery and the goals of the training but that's different than training that specifically geared toward increasing testosterone. Duncan French who's one of the directors of the UFC Performance Center when he was a graduate student at University of Connecticut stores did some beautiful work he and his colleagues found the ideal training protocols for stimulating testosterone release which is something that many people want to do for a variety of reasons and that involve doing six sets of 10 repetitions even if it requires lightning the weight on one set to the next with about two minutes, 120 seconds rest in between sets which if you think about it is pretty short rest and is pretty darn hard work. Now what's interesting is that there's a very limited threshold for increasing testosterone that protocol of six sets of 10 repetitions led to these big increases in serum testosterone but if people did it 10 sets of 10 so just four more repetitions per set then testosterone did not increase in fact you got more of this catabolic cortisol like pathway you get other benefits from this or so-called 10 sets of 10 protocol but not the testosterone increase and maybe even reductions in testosterone. Now it's important to point out that that six sets of 10 was done with big compound movements so things like squats or deadlift or chinups or things to that sort and those were done as single sessions not in concert with a bunch of other exercise. Although if athletes are doing that there's no reason why they couldn't also do other types of training elsewhere in the week. I asked Duncan about this and he mentioned that that done twice a week is probably the maximum amount that anyone could do that and still maintain this increase in testosterone. It's a very interesting protocol because as the neuroscientist it's amazing to me that six sets of 10 repetitions with something causes it to thinkly excuse me it causes a distinctly different result in terms of hormone output than 10 sets of 10 of the exact same movement and it speaks to the in exquisite way in which nerve-to-mustle connections dictate the whole physiology of your entire system. If there's a theme that I really want to bring forward today is that weight training or resistance training of any kind is really used for either systemic effects. Right? 10% of training done where you're feeling that burn which means lactate will be present and sending signals to your brain and your heart and to your liver that are beneficial or isolating muscles which may also generate a kind of a lactate which is associated with the burn result but that isolation of muscles is distinctly different so systemic versus isolated. That was of the two general ways in which resistance training can be applied. So I just wanted to mention that earlier protocol because it's well supported by the literature. If you were to incorporate that protocol you might ask well then can you do any other weight training during the week and sure of course you can provided your recovering. So let's talk about how you know if you're recovering how you know if a muscle is recovered and how you know if your whole system is recovered because recovery is what dictates whether or not you can come back and do more work of a different kind meaning you do leg training one day can you and should you come back and do upper body training the next day and it dictates whether or not you'll see any improvement from session to session at all. Before I talk about recovery I just want to make sure I nailed down the details that I was able to extract from the literature and from my conversation with Dr. Galpin. If you're wondering how quickly to perform repetitions for sake of hypertrophy or strength gains anywhere from a half a second per repetition all the way up to eight seconds per repetition it doesn't seem to matter. Again if you're thinking about explosiveness or building speed or your specifically using resistance training to build endurance that's a separate matter we talked about explosive instance speed I'll talk about endurance in a few moments. We also talked about in-between set contractions so called selfie effect of people flexing a particular muscle isolating a particular muscle between sets. Just want to mention that would be a terrible thing to do if your goal is performance on sets so moving a particular amount of weight that's actually going to diminish the amount of weight that you can move it's going to enhance muscle growth and it's going to enhance the nerve to muscle isolation of that particular pathway. So again that flexing between sets is going to favor hypertrophy not performance. If you're trying to get stronger you're trying to move more weights you're trying to distribute work and you're trying to do maybe skill training with resistance then flexing between sets is absolutely the wrong thing to do for obvious reasons you're fatiguing the muscle further just remaining still or walking around a little bit has been shown to be beneficial in terms of moving some of the lactate out of the muscle as well as just recovering between sets. Now how long to recover between sets? There's a question for the testosterone protocol Duncan French and colleagues found that it was about two minutes keeping that really on the clock two minutes not longer for hypertrophy and for strength gains it does seem that resting anywhere from two minutes or even three or four or even five or six minutes can be beneficial and if you're interested in expanding the volume of work that you can do in a given session at high capacity, at high intensity with a given weight please see the episode that I did on cold and performance about super charging performance which is based on the work of my colleague Craig Keller in the biology department at Stanford which talks about Palmer cooling about how you can cool the core of the body best through the palms using these particular venous portals that are only present in your hands people are now doing this with ice packs or with gel packs there are a number of different ways one can do this I talk all about that in that episode it allows you to do more repetitions and more work at a given weight over time so rather than getting 10 repetitions and then eight and then seven and six through proper use of polymer cooling one can do 10 10 10 10 and even add sets that's one way that one can accomplish higher volume work without having to drop the weight considerably so that's where you can hit that really sweet spot if that's your goal of getting strong and generating some hypertrophy because as soon as you have to drop to lower to lighter weights excuse me then you're shifting more towards hypertrophy and endurance and less toward strength even given muscles so check out that episode the last thing besides between set contractions and whether or not you're distributing work or whether or not you're really trying to isolate muscles is this notion of pre-existing muscles it's been shown over and over again that for instance if you want to generate force in a given muscle and really isolate that doing the isolation work before a compound movement so this would be you know leg extensions the thing where you sit and you extend your your toes up toward the ceiling leg extensions before squats will allow the squats to target that muscle group more effectively and that makes perfectly good sense based on the hand-in-size principle and fatiguing motor units it should be obvious why that's the case but of course that's going to be anti-performance in terms of how much weight you can lift and maybe even the form that you can maintain when you move to the bigger compound movement so you really have to ask yourself a number of questions how good are you at isolating a given muscle therefore how many sets do you want to do how often are you willing to train therefore how many sets are you going to do in a given session versus how many are you going to distribute across the week are you aiming for performance are you going to distribute that work across the nervous system and musculature are you trying to move weights or you trying to challenge muscles if you're trying to challenge muscles then you really want to focus on things like this pre-existing the isolation of a muscle before the compound movement your performance on compound movements will absolutely suffer but your ability to isolate that muscle and generate hypertrophy through the accumulation of larger mice and those bigger balloons will benefit and once again if you're trying to get faster then the speed of the movement really matters so how do we know if we've recovered how can we test recovery and this is not just recovery from resistance training this is recovery from running recovery from swimming up until now I've been talking about resistance training more or less in a vacuum I haven't even touched on the fact that many people are running and they're doing resistance training or they're swimming and they're doing resistance training it's not simply the case that if a given muscle is fatigue you can just work other muscles because even if you've beautifully isolated a muscle let's say you have incredible abilities to isolate just your quadriceps for instance and you do a workout where you isolate your quadriceps you do your six sets of intense work or maybe use polymer cooling and you're able to do 12 sets of intense work and you're done and that muscle group the next day is certainly not going to be recovered unless you're somebody who's extraordinary at recovery or you're enhancing your recovery through chemical means which we'll talk about at the end well you can assess systemic recovery meaning your nervous system and your nervous system's ability to generate force both distributed and isolated through three main tests and fortunately these tests are very simple and two of them are essentially zero cost required no equipment HRV heart rate variability has made its way finally into the forefront of exercise physiology and even into the popular discussion I've talked about HRV before how when we exhale our heart rate slows down because of the way there are diaphragms connected to our heart into our brain and the way our brain is connected to our heart excuse me when we inhale our heart rate speeds up and that is the basis of heart rate variability heart rate variability is good it means that you're breathing properly and when I say it's good it means you want a lot of heart rate variability you don't want a heart rate that is high or low consistently over time that might come as a bit of a surprise for you endurance athletes who probably are trying to accomplish your endurance work with at a steady cadence it really hit that nice sweet spot where you're breathing rhythmically your heart rate is going rhythmically you're in that steady heart rate and then away from exercise you have a nice low heart rate as they say well nice low heart rate isn't necessarily always so nice turns out the introducing bouts of increasing your heart rate during exercise and even through your waking day through stressful events even is provided their brief is beneficial a good nerve to heart system benefits from being able to increase heart rate and decrease heart rate heart rate variability is good so you don't want high heart rate you don't want low heart rate all the time but heart rate variability is difficult for a lot of people to measure there are some devices that will allow you to do that various watches and devices there are more devices becoming available all the time hopefully soon some that are integrated with your phone that involve no contact or anything on your body but those do carry some cost and they are not perfect yet the measures of heart rate variability that one can use while in movement are you know still in the phase I would say of technology development where everyone isn't using them let's leave it at that there are two measures however whether or not you recovered that you can use first thing in the morning when you wake up maybe after five to ten minutes if you like but ideally right when you wake up in order to assess how well recovered you are and therefore whether or not you should train your whole system at all that day the first one is grip strength grip strength the ability to generate force at the level of squeezing the fist or you know squeezing down on something might seem like kind of a trivial way to assess recovery but it's not because it relates to your ability to use your upper motor neurons to control your lower motor neurons and to generate isolated force so that's really what you're assessing when you do that some people will use you know one of these grip tools or there there's a Costello has this toy that shaped like a donut and it's this hard rubber and I've tried this before you know if I've been working really hard not sleeping very well or I've been training a lot any one or combination of those things my grip suffers I can't actually squeeze that thing down as much as I can't Costello because he was born with a you know like a 24 inch neck and even those never touched a weight somehow he can just clamp down on that thing and it just you know he can turn into a pancake with ease and he likes to chuck a while I struggle with this thing but on a good day I can squeeze this thing so that I eliminate the hole in the donut so to speak you can also take a floor weight and excuse me a floor scale and squeeze the scale and see how much force you can generate I would do that as a baseline to establish what you can do when you're well rested and then if you do that in the morning you can see whether or not you're able to generate the same amount of or you could use over the rubber donut or something a lot of this is very subjective with the scale you're really trying to assess whether or not you can generate the same amount of force if you start seeing a 10% or 20% certainly reduction in that that's concerning it means that your system that your nervous system as a whole it's not necessarily fatigued it's that the pathways from nerve to muscle are still in the process of rewiring themselves in order to generate force and you might think well I trained one muscle group one day why am I having a hard time doing this for a completely different muscle group doesn't make any sense but there's something about the upper motor neuron to lower motor neuron pathway generally that allows you to use something like grip strength as a kind of a thermometer if you will of your ability to recover so look for your ability to generate force in grip when you first wake up it's not going to be as good as it is at you know 3 p.m. after a cup of coffee and a couple meals but that the point isn't performance overall the point is to assess whether or not you're getting better worse or the same from date today the other one that's really terrific and the Andy Galpins group is using and I'm delighted about this because it relates to something that my lab is very excited about as well is Carmediox I tolerance so this is a really interesting tool that endurance athletes strength athletes I think can all benefit from in fact athletes and people of all kinds you even if you're not an athlete even if you're not exercising at all there's a good question of whether or not your system is a whole is doing okay or not you know we rely on the thermometer do we have a fever or not we rely on subjective things you know do I feel good or not am I digesting well or not those are all subjective the Carmediox I tolerance test is it's objective in that it measures your capacity to engage the so-called parasympathetic arm of your nervous system which is the calming aspect of your nervous system and it measures your ability to consciously control a particular skeletal muscle which is your diaphragm so here's how you do the Carmediox I tolerance test you wake up in the morning if you have to use the restroom first do that but try and stay away from your phone try and if you have your phone put on airplane mode go to the timer or use that hand watch or some other way of measuring time stay off social media for just a few seconds it'll be okay and what you're going to do is you're going to inhale through your nose as deeply as you can you do this lying down sitting you know sitting whatever inhale through your nose and then exhale all the way so that's one you're going to repeat that four times okay so inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale exhale four times and ideally you're inhaling through the nose and you're exhaling through the mouth that's just the beginning of this Carmediox I tolerance test then you take a fifth inhale as deep as you can through your nose fill your lungs as much as you can and if you can try and expand your uh make your stomach go out while you do that that means that your diaphragm is really engaged so your inhaling as much as you possibly can then hit the timer and your goal is to release that air as slowly as possible through your mouth so it looks like you have a tiny tiny little straw in your mouth and you're letting it go as slowly as you possibly can measure what we call the Carmedioxide blow off time or discard rate I know you can all sit with lungs empty after you eliminate all that air but don't lie to yourself don't stop the timer when you've been sitting with your lungs empty for a while stop the timer when you are finally no longer able to exhale any more air okay so for so you're doing inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale slowly I just said it quickly for a second time then you do this fifth big inhale through your mouth and then and I'm not going to do it for the full duration and then you're measuring that time your Carmedioxide discard rate will be somewhere between one second and presumably two minutes two minutes would be a heroic Carmedioxide discard time 30 seconds would be more typical 20 seconds would be fast if your Carmedioxide discard time is 20 or 25 seconds or less you are not necessarily recovered from your previous days activities okay there's ways to push through this but hold on to that thought for a moment if your Carmedioxide discard time is somewhere between about 30 seconds and 60 seconds you are in what we would call kind of the green zone where you are in a position to do more physical work and if your Carmedioxide discard time is somewhere between 65 and 120 seconds well then you have almost certainly recovered your nervous system I'm not talking about the individual muscles but your nervous system is prepared to do more work and Andy's lab has great data on this as it relates to exercise physiology I think that story should be out in the not too distant future my lab has been using Carmedioxide discard time to look at anxiety and recovery from bouts of anxiety so too totally independent projects but using the same measure so you've got HRV which requires some technology usually you've got grip strength which you can assess subjectively or you can use a floor scale and now you have Carmedioxide tolerance you want to do this in the morning when you wake up and keep track just write down in a little book or maybe just keep tracking your mind of your Carmedioxide discard time if you find that your discard times are dropping even if they're in the 42nd range or 52nd range but normally you can do 75 seconds or 120 seconds if they're starting to drop by anywhere from 15 to 20% you're veering in the direction of not recovering and I I'm really keen on this tool because everybody has different recovery abilities some people are eating really well and sleeping really well some people have minimal stress or can buffer stress really well other people you know you know they dissolve into a puddle of tears if they read one you know text message that's troubling or whatever you know and I realize and I say that was sympathy I realize people have veering levels of stress and demand in their life it's just impossible to to prescribe an entire protocol it says okay yes you should train today and this is exactly what you should do no you shouldn't use Carmedioxide discard rate because a it's valuable it's informative b it's zero cost and c it's something you can track objectively over time and that's really the key and I just should I'd be remiss if I didn't say that what Carmedioxide discard rate is tapping into is your ability to mechanically control your diaphragm certainly that's one aspect of it but that relates in a very direct way to your ability to put the break on your stress system to engage the so-called parasympathetic or calming arm of your autonomic nervous system and another thing that Andy Galbin's group is testing is at the offset of training after your run after your weight training session maybe even after your plyometrics session we don't really talk about about jumping and throwing and that sort of thing maybe we'll talk about it in a future episode but they and other groups including some elite athletes and other groups that are very interested in physical performance are using a tool where they deliberately disengage for five minutes at the end of training they deliberately engage this calming or parasympathetic arm of the nervous system and you can do that through any number of different tools I'm a big fan of respiration tools because they're always available to you your breathing is always there I talk about some of these tools in previous episodes but you could use things like non-sleep deep rest and STR at the end of a training session you could do 10 physiological size double inhales through the nose followed by long exhales that will definitely engage the parasympathetic nervous system at the end of training so rather than finish your training session and then just hop onto your phone serious athletes and people who are serious about recovery initiate that recovery at the very end of their training and they start to kick start that that recovery process rather and they measure CO2 tolerance in the morning so there are several groups that are doing that in fact I know several groups because I'm working with them that are using physiological size between sets in order to recover their nervous system and maintain nerve-to-mustle contractability maintain focus throughout their training session enhance their focus by doing a few physiological size so double inhale exhale in between sets so they're getting very focused and very intense about their strength work or explosiveness work or muscle isolation work during their sets and then in between sets they're deliberately disengaging the nervous system and then they're re-engaging it again so I just wanted to emphasize that so recovery is a complex process it's got a lot of things but the CO2 tolerance session should be a valuable tool now another tool for recovery that people are very excited about is the use of cold and the ice bath and this is important if you are somebody who uses cold through cold shower or ice bath or jumping in a lake or a river whatever it is that used to generate cold as a recovery tool you should be aware that there are data starting to emerge that if your goal is recovery or strength improvements using cold within the four hours following a workout I'm not saying about polymer cooling I'm talking about whole body cooling or cooling from the neck down yes it will reduce inflammation yes it will reduce the amount of delayed onset muscle soreness one readout of how intense or damaging a given workout was not the only readout but it does seem to interfere with some of the things like mTOR pathways the mammalian targeted rapomis and pathway and other pathways related to an inflammation that promote muscle repair remember and muscle growth remember stress tension and damage or the stimulus for nerve to muscle connections to change and for muscles to get bigger stronger and better and so if you're getting into the ice bath after training or taking a really cold shower after doing resistance training you are likely short circling the improvements that you're trying to create now athletes who are trying to recover quickly so that they can get back into more training sessions or let's say you're somebody who doesn't really want to gain much strength or hypertrophy and you're mainly focused on endurance and you want to do more endurance work and you've been weight training well then exposing yourself to cold can be beneficial but you're not going to get as great of benefits from the resistance training in other words cold after resistance training seems to short circuit some of the benefits of that resistance training there are some other things that can short circuit the benefits of resistance training as well one of those is anti histamines some interesting data were published recently I believe it was in scientific reports yes that showed that anti histamines can prevent some of the benefits of cardiovascular exercise of endurance type work as a running swimming fairly long duration or even sprint type work as well as inhibit some of the processes associated with resistance training remember resistance training or endurance training that's a stimulus for stress and the adaptation to that stress is how you get better that you can run further faster lift more weight hypertrophy the muscle etc so anti histamines can be a problem obviously don't compromise your ability to breathe completely but anti histamines generally work by blocking what are called mast cells MAST mast cells are really interesting cells that we'll talk about in our month on neuro immune function they travel in the bloodstream and there are these little packets that burst open at sites of inflammation muscle damage and inflammation is a signal that something needs to change and so taking into histamines it appears can disrupt some of that inflammatory process so you actually want inflammation during and immediately after a workout then you want to bring inflammation down later and I'll mention how to do that the other thing are non steroid anti inflammatory drugs you know their trade names these are pain killers that many people take those as I've mentioned in a previous episode can interfere with the benefits of endurance training and the benefits of resistance training in addition to that they block pain signals and pain is a very good signal that you might be doing something wrong and so while nobody likes to be in pain I suppose there are probably a few people out there like to be in pain but that's a different story but nobody likes to be in pain the non steroid anti inflammatory is the insides as they're called anti histamines seem to prevent a lot of the gains the improvements in endurance strength and size that people are specifically using exercise for so be cautious about your use of non steroid anti inflammatory drugs especially within the four hours preceding or the four hours following exercise so I hope you're starting to get the picture in order to change the nerve to muscle connectivity in ways that will better serve you you need a stressor during the actual training which particular stressor depends on your training goals but that stressor is almost always going to be associated with inflammation and then after the training you want to try and get into a state of reduced inflammation and that's why you would do some some sort of protocol non-sleep depressed which we will link to in our caption or perhaps you would use the hypnosis app that we've talked about before reverie re the e ri dot com there's a great app for accessing deep rest states or the physiological side to try and get the system your system to calm down after training there are also tools that one can use to reduce inflammation at a kind of foundational level away from training and these are tools that I've talked about many times before but I'll just restate them again the kind of golden three according to anti galpine and the ones that he recommends are sufficient omega threes again that can be accomplished through diet through whole food intake or through supplementation or both so in general getting above a thousand milligrams of EPA per day to keep inflammation low or relatively low vitamin D and in some cases magnesium malate magnesium malate seems to be particularly effective in offsetting delayed onset muscle soreness soreness itself is not required for improvements in strength, improvements in explosiveness, improvements in hypertrophy that's a myth now if you do experience delayed onset muscle soreness chances are you stressed that particular muscle pretty well or even maybe too well maybe you stressed it too much and you need longer recovery there's a total debate out there about whether or not you should train again when a muscle is still sore I think the general takeaway is know that means it's not recovered and there are things of course like massage like facial release and things of that sort sauna cold that can perhaps accelerate the movement from soreness to not sore but in general the omega three vitamin D and magnesium malate excuse me trio seem to be an effective way to reduce inflammation at kind of a systemic level but remember you want inflammation provided you're not damaging the muscle so much that you're injured during the training session because that's the stimulus for change in those muscles I want to talk about a few other things that support the process of nerve to muscle communication and touch on some of the things that a lot of people are doing to try to quote unquote enhance their workouts and evaluate whether or not those are in fact enhancing workouts or not because weight training unlike a lot of other forms of exercise has a unique aspect to it which is this feature that I guess some people call it the pump which is the fact that blood goes into the muscle when you train it's the only kind of training where you actually get a window into what the result might actually look like before you actually accomplish that result so if you think about when you go out for a hard run and let's say you you out for a two mile run let's say your goal is to break you want to do a sub 10 to mile actually when I went to university I was running cross country my senior year of high school and I wanted to walk on for the cross country team and so I went out there and turned out you had to do a sub 10 to mile and I think the best mile I ever ran in high school was a 457 which isn't terrible I can't do that now it's not even close to what high school athletes the best high school athletes can do now but that would have mean meant doing it back to back so it was sub 10 minute to mile they even come close until Costello the story the other day and he just got a laugh at me and was like why would you even want to run two miles because Costello is built almost exclusively of these type two fast twitch muscles they're designed for moving objects he's incredibly strong he has been since he was a puppy I mean that dog could probably drag a tractor if he wanted to but he can't really go far whereas a gray hounder a whip it or some of these other sight hounds or sent hounds can go go go they have a higher percentage of the so-called slow twitch muscle fibers they are much better at endurance so a sub 10 to mile would have been very very challenging no chance I could have done that I don't think even even with a lot of training but let's say that you want to improve your performance in a given type of exercise let's talk about some of the things that seem to work across the board to improve strength improve high-perchrophy and improve nerve to muscle communication and performance the first thing that's absolutely key for nerve to muscle communication and physical performance of any kind might not sound that exciting to you but it is very exciting and that's salt nerves nerve cells neurons communicate with each other and communicate with muscle by electricity but that electricity is generated by particular ions moving into and out of the neuron and the rushing in of a particular ion sodium salt is what allows nerve cells to fire if you don't have enough salt in your system your neurons and your brain and your nerve to muscle communication will be terrible if you have sufficient salt it will be excellent how much salt will depend on how much water you're drinking how much caffeine you're drinking and how much food you're ingesting so and whether or not you're taking any dioretics how hot it is et cetera how much you're sweating so you want to make sure that you have enough salt potassium and magnesium in your system if you want to perform well I realize that salt is into very glamorous performance tool but it is vital it is absolutely vital and the endurance athletes and the people that train in high heat can speak to the fact that when your electrolytes are low your brain doesn't function your body doesn't function nearly as well in fact even for mental work for studying and for writing and for doing math and coding doing analytic work of any kind even a hard conversation that's important to you having sufficient electrolytes is really going to help and being low on electrolytes won't help and just drinking water won't help because you need electrolytes the other thing that's been shown over and over again numerous well controlled studies to improve muscle performance is creating early on there was a lot of controversy about creating but there are many studies if you want you can go to this website that everyone now knows I love which is this free website examin.com that there are no fewer than 18 studies there 66 studies so 18 studies supporting that muscle creatine content can be increased by ingesting creatine how much creatine well I asked the experts and they tell me that for somebody who's about 180 pounds five grams a day should be sufficient or so heavier than 180 so if you get like if you're 220 pound or 230 pound person 10 to 15 grams of creatine people lighter than 180 pounds maybe three to five grams of protein excuse me creatine or even one to three grams creatine is a fuel source for early early in bouts of activity for high intensity activity it is also a fuel source for neurons in the brain and it can have some cognitive enhancing effects so creatine is very interesting molecule early on when it was released as a supplement it was it was thought that you had to load it in higher dosages for a few days and then maintain it at lower dosages so you take you know 20 or 30 grams a day then back off to five or 10 it doesn't seem to be the case that you can get all the benefits from taking the dosages at the low level I just mentioned a few moments ago as they relate to body weight throughout so salt and electrolytes absolutely key you need those present you need to be well hydrated creatine seems to have a performance enhancing effect there's 66 studies 66 showing that power output is greatly increased anywhere from 12 to 20 percent and this is sprinting and running and jumping as well as weightlifting by creatine the ability to hydrate your body is improved by creatine because of the way that it brings more water into cells various kinds as an indirect effect it can help increase lean mass because of the way that it brings more water into muscle and probably also because of the way that if you get stronger you can generate more force and generate more hypertrophy it reduces fatigue seven studies have shown that reduces fatigue there are even some interesting effects on improving cognition after traumatic brain injury although that's a serious medical condition in situations you absolutely should talk to a board certified physician before adding anything or taking anything out of your current regimen there are a few other effects that are interesting and notable but the big ones are the ones that I referred to before about increased power output etc and I just want to emphasize that creatine can increase this hormone that we talked about in the testosterone episode dihydrate testosterone which is testosterone converted by five-hour for a ductase into dihydrate testosterone it's the more dominant and urgent in humans leads to increases in strength and libido and so forth it also can increase male pattern baldness some people not everybody experience some hair loss with creatine other people don't some people experience accelerated beard growth because basically the issue is the opposite effect on hair follicles on the face as it does on the scalp some people don't women who ingest creatine there are essentially no data showing that it increases hair loss or facial hair growth but of course everyone is different so you can go to examine calm you can explore those studies so creatine definitely a powerful performance enhancing molecule the other one one that personally I've never tried but that seems to have a very strong and well supportive effects is beta alanine now beta alanine is interesting because when you hear about weight training you think about heavy dead lifts and bench presses all that kind of stuff that people are doing but beta alanine seems to support exercise that is of slightly longer duration so a mix of anaerobic and aerobic type movement so things these are physical performance in the 60 to 240 second range so you can use your mind and kind of figure out you know like things that weights of the that limit you to eight to 15 repetitions cardiovascular exercise of the sort like rolling or sprinting so interval work it seems to help with that kind of work so we're not talking about long runs we're not talking about heavy dead lifts the standard dose is somewhere between two and five grams again as always check with a doctor make sure these things are safe for you I'm not responsible for your health you are I don't say that just protect me I would say that also to protect you but it really seems to improve muscular endurance improve anaerobic running capacity reduce fatigue there even some interesting effects on reduction of body fat and improvements in lean mass so creatine beta alanine electrolites these are kind of the the core three things that seem to improve performance and are well supported by the scientific literature and in the earlier episode on super charging performance we talked about polymer cooling that's certainly a performance enhancing tool it's nothing even just you're cooling your palms in a very specific way that's very powerful now what about for longer duration bouts of exercise we've mainly been focusing on resistance training but what about for long runs long swims these kinds of things well it does seem that beat juice and ingesting things like arginine and citrilline can improve performance for those long bouts of exercise that's mainly going to be due to effects of those compounds on vasodilation it's going to open up the vascular and allow more blood flow do note that things like citrilline and arginine can have some side effects if you will they can increase the likelihood of having herpes cold sore outbreaks on the mouth the arginine is in the pathway by which I don't know if people know this but the herpes virus lives on neurons of the trigeminal nerve that innervate the lips and the eyes and the mucus membranes of the face so this is the herpes type one simplex virus the virus lives on those neurons and then periodically inflames those neurons and that's what leads to the cold sore it seems like arginine and citrilline can lead to increases in cold sores and canker sores and outbreaks of those kinds so you want to be aware of that that's not everybody but and not everybody is carrying hsv1 just be aware that I think it's now 80 or 90% of people by time they are 12 years old they're they've contracted ages if we want it's very contagious and typically people we get one outbreak and then only under conditions of stress or heightened arginine or citrilline ingestion we'll have them later again this is the this is not a necessarily a sexually an STI this is a sexually intimate infection this is an infection that is passed very easily from mucus membranes just in terms of touching objects and things to that sort very common in the in the general population any discussion about muscle and muscle performance would not be adequate if we didn't mention something about nutrition but rather than have a whole discussion about nutrition because there's lots of information about that online like for instance if you want to gain muscle that you need to have a clerks surplus of about 10 to 15 percent you could have a clerks surplus of more if you want to avoid gaining weight then you would not create a clerks surplus etc you can find all that information online that's not with this podcast is really about we had a month where we talked a lot about hormones and food and moods we talked about foods but more as they relate to the nervous system when it comes to supporting muscle to supporting the synthesis of larger what I call myocin balloons it does seem that ingesting 700 to 3000 milligrams of the essential amino acid loose scene with each meal is important now that does not necessarily mean from supplements in fact most people recommend that you get your protein you get your amino acids including your essential amino acids and you're losing from whole foods high quality proteins are high density proteins what do you mean by that well it is true that a lot of sources of protein are found in things like beans and nuts and things like that that all the essential amino acids can be found there but per unit calorie if it's in your practice if in it's in your ethics to ingest animal proteins it's true that for instance 200 calories of steak or chicken or fish or eggs will have a higher density of essential amino acids than you equivalent amount of calories from nuts or plants that's just simply the way it works so I'm not for the vegans and vegetarians I'm certainly not saying there's no way that you can support muscle growth you absolutely can some of them might want to supplement looseine but this 700 to 3000 milligrams of looseine per meal is one of the best ways that's been shown to support the synthesis of more myocin if your goal is high per trophy and it's also the way that you would support muscle repair if your goal is strength so that specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy and strength and I encourage you to think about this protein density issue and whether or not you ingest animal proteins or you don't to think about whether or not you're getting sufficient essential amino acids especially looseine now many people have addressed the question of whether or not you need to eat six or seven times a day it turns out that you don't that's kind of the old school thinking that you need to very frequently I think for certain athletes we're very active for drug assisted meaning people that are enhancing their testosterone levels to superficial logical levels where they are experiencing very heightened levels of protein synthesis and they can utilize all that that might make sense again I'm not supporting the use of those performance enhancing drugs but there are people doing that and that's one of the reasons why they eat so frequently and so much protein for typical people who are not doing that I imagine most of you are not then it does appear that you need to eat but you don't need to eat six or seven times a day it does seem like not eating once a day is also important so somewhere between one meal a day and six meals a day lies the more reasonable two or three or maybe four times a day I think that a whole discussion about this is warranted and we'll have this discussion with Dr. Galpin in at a future time of how whether or not eating protein more frequently can enhance this my my synthesis but I think the simple takeaway from the literature that I was able to extract and from my discussion with him is eating two to four times a day making sure you're getting sufficient amino acids in a way that's compatible with your ethics and with your nutritional regimen is going to support muscle repair muscle growth strength improvements etc just fine there's one more thing that I'd like to cover which is the relationship between particular kinds of exercise and our ability to think and perform cognitive functions we all hear that exercise is so vital for our brain that it supports our brain health and our body health and indeed that's true provided it's done correctly however many of us are familiar with the experience of going for a run or going for a swim or working out hard in the gym and then not being able to use our brain to be essentially useless for cognitive functions for the rest of the day I discuss this with Dr. Galpin this morning and I learned something very interesting which is that hard bouts of exercise of the sort where you're training near failure or you're generating focused muscular contractions for a session that lasts anywhere from I don't know 30 45 minutes maybe 60 minutes or a long run where you're engaging in some interval training during that run after exercise there's a reduction in oxygenation of the brain so there's actually a quite significant dip in the amount of oxygen that your neurons are getting and therefore your ability to think so it's important that you control the intensity and the duration of your training sessions so that you're still able to do well in life and lean into life the way you need to because I'm guessing most of you are not in a position to just prioritize your physical training you also need to use your minds I'm certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise but also the requirement of needing to perform cognitive work throughout the day it also turns out that you can leverage something interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus and it has to do with the way that your body and your nervous system predict bouts of intense focused effort so let's say you're doing resistance training two or three times a week maybe even four times a week and you're doing it consistently at a given time there are clocks literally biological clocks within the liver and within the brain that learn to predict that focus and that intense work if you are trying to get intense cognitive work done you might try scheduling that cognitive work on the days when you don't do physical training at the same time when you normally would do that intense focused physical training because the systems of the body that generate a sea of calling release and other normodulators the systems of the body and brain that generate focused effort those are on this sort of clock mechanism in a way that you likely will find that after just a week of training at regular times you will be able to focus readily on other things when you're not training provided you do it during the period of time of day when you normally would train so this is kind of an indirect positive effect you're harnessing the focus and the expectation of focus in your nervous system for that particular time of day and of course we've been remiss if we didn't talk about time of day for training turns out that whether or not you do whether or not you train in the morning or in the afternoon doesn't really seem to matter for sake of things like hypertrophy and strength etc everyone seems to have a time of day that they prefer to train I've said before and their reasons based on body temperature rhythms and cortisol release that training 30 minutes three hours or 11 hours after your normal waking time can be very beneficial and can provide us sort of predictability or regularity to when your body will be ready to train and best act to train well there is some evidence that training in the afternoon is better for performance whereas training for body composition changes and strength changes etc it doesn't really matter when you train so you also want to make it compatible with sleep compatible with work that really gets down into the weeds of optimization but I think it's interesting to note that if you're going to train at a regular time you can take the days when you don't train and use that to enhance your cognitive focus for things that have nothing to do with exercise so this might be writing a reading or music or math etc. Typically I restrict these podcast episodes to about 90 minutes so called altradian cycle for learning today was a bit longer and I admit that I tried to pack a lot into this. It is the last episode in this month on physical performance I figured in this case more is better especially since everything is time stamped for you you certainly don't have to watch it all at once and you can come back to it over and over again into the precise locations in the episode that you like in order to take notes or extract the information that you need. I'd like to point you to Dr. Andy Galpens page. I highly recommend looking into the work that he's doing if you want more details. He's very very skilled excellent communicator. He's superb at what he does. He's a professor. He works with athletes. He works with typical folks in the exercise and muscle physiology world. Brad shown fields work.
